<p><br/>
Lana:<br/>
How did the investigation go yesterday, Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Frankly, there are still a lot of... gray areas.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Or rather, the whole thing is one big gray area...
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
Don't worry about me, no matter what the outcome. I'm ready to accept my fate.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
I believe in you, sis.
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
Mr. Wright, let me offer you a word of advice.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes?
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
A defense attorney should never "believe" their client.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
The defendant is called to trial because they are suspected of wrongdoing! Never forget that.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Ms. Skye, you... You remind me a lot of Mia. But there is one decisive difference between you and her.
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
And that is?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You're not a defense attorney.
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
... I believe it's almost time for the trial. Good luck, Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(My first trial without a Fey helping me... No one's going to bail me out this time... I'll be alone in there... So I have to discover the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span> all by myself!)</span>

Judge:<br/>
The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Lana Skye.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Edgeworth... <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [I haven't been in court since Edgeworth's trial...

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I hope that personal feelings will not be a part of the proceedings today, Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I will choose the path I think is right, regardless of what those around me might say. The judgment to be made here is in our hands, not those of anyone else.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well, Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement please.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Chief Prosecutor Lana Skye has committed an unpardonable crime. Not only this, but she was rash enough to commit it in the Prosecutor's Office lot!
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Wow... He's much more forceful in person. I suddenly feel like confessing to everything!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
However, she will now pay for her rashness with her life. There was a witness to her crime... A "professional" witness!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well then, call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The prosecution calls its first witness, Ms. Angel Starr, to the stand.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The "Cough-up Queen"...?)</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm? Haven't I seen you somewhere...?
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
You ordered the Caviar Lunch, right?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Ho ho! Caviar! I've never eaten caviar before!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The judge is really wolfing it down...)</span>
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
Ah, and for you... I have a Fiesta Bowl.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Uh... thanks.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Will the witness state her name and profession?
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
Ah, and you, sir... Did you order "The Fingerprint" lunchbox?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It is too early for lunch. Your name and profession, please.
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
... Well, Your Honor? How does it taste?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
So this is why everyone raves about caviar! It's so tasty it hurts! I always thought caviar would taste like pickled tapioca.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What the heck does pickled tapioca taste like!?)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Name. Profession. Now.
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
Me? The name is Angel Starr. Don't go forgetting it. I find myself running Lunchland these days. Is... that what you wanted me to say, Mr. Edgeworth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Very well, witness. Please describe the incident to us.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The prosecution will wait! I'm not finished eating...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hurry it up!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mmmm... Very well, Mr. Edgeworth. As you know, we usually call on the police to provide a description of the crime...
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
Your Honor, as Mr. Edgeworth has said to the court... I am a... "professional."
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Uh... Huh? What exactly does that mean?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Until two years ago, Ms. Angel Starr was a special investigator with the police. She was a first-rate homicide detective.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Wh-whaaaat!? Ms. Starr was a detective!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-hah! I-I know who you are!!! Cough-up...!?
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
Cough-up Queen Angel Starr, Your Honor. Long time no see.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
V-v-very well! Y-you may continue with the description, Ms. Starr!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Just who is this lady!?)</span>
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
If I might have the court's attention over here... The parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office is divided into two blocks. <span style="color:#E16935">A Block</span> is for the Prosecutor's Office personnel. <span style="color:#E16935">B Block</span> is for visitors and clients... A chain divider separates the two blocks.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I suppose that's to keep visitors from taking up prosecutor's spaces, yes.
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
The crime took place by a car in the back of <span style="color:#E16935">A Block</span>, in the car's trunk. The killer stabbed the victim with a <span style="color:#E16935">knife</span> and went to drive the body out. Unfortunately for her there was a witness, and an arrest was made on the spot.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
And who was this valiant "witness"...?
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
Why, it was me, Your Honor.
</p><p><span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [Floor Plans added to the Court Record.] in the original release"><span style="color:#0070C0">Parking Lot Floor Plans added to the Court Record.</span></span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [Floor Plans added to the Court Record.] in the original release)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Witness, did you see the very moment of the crime?
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
Of course, Your Honor. Immediately after that, I apprehended the Chief Prosecutor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... It seems rather cut and dry, doesn't it? Well, Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Uh... I can't agree on principle, Your Honor.
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
It seems that some poor losers are unwilling to accept the truth, Your Honor. Shall I proceed to crush what little hope they have remaining?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
If you can... then give them your worst, Ms. Starr!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

I was on my way to deliver a lunchbox to my boyfriend...<br/>

Then, through a wire fence, I saw the chief prosecutor standing next to a garish car.<br/>
The chief prosecutor was holding a knife in her right hand....<br/>
Then, she thrust the pointy tip of the knife into Detective Goodman's chest!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... Bringing a lunchbox to your boyfriend? How touching!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Hmph. As you can see... There is no room for doubt.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The key "point" of your testimony seems to be nothing other than... the point of the knife which you saw being stabbed into Detective Goodman!
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
So... how does it feel to be so utterly crushed?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I... I'm still thinking about that.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
I-it's merely a flesh wound, Mr. Wright!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
How did you know!?
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
I respect the prosecutors' basic abhorrence of crime. Yet their methods are ugly and twisted. Twisted methods will always lead to tragedy.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The lunchlady's uninformed opinion is duly noted.
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
Given that they are used to erasing inconvenient evidence at their whim... Killing off a detective that knew too much is merely an extension of that.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Ms. Starr... do you have something personal against prosecutors?
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
I felt that I had found my dream job when I became an investigator... And if I hadn't been laid off by those prosecutors over there, I'd still be one.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Laid off...? <span style="color:#0070C0">(She was fired...)</span>
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
To me, prosecutors are nothing more than worms. That said, I am a pro, as you know. My testimony is unbiased... and flawless.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well. You may continue, Ms. Starr.

Yes. "This" boyfriend, "that" boyfriend, and "the other" boyfriend. Care to join? The "yet another" boyfriend position is still open for applicants.

Incidentally, the knife with which the victim was stabbed was also Mr. Edgeworth's. Wasn't it?

Er... Ahem, yes, that's about right.
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
Prosecutors are, by nature, well-versed in the location of a man's vital organs. I'm sure it was easier than boiling an egg for my egg salad surprise set.

The bloody murder weapon a red car... all belonging to the prosecutor there!?<br/>
The defendant is the chief prosecutor for the district, right?<br/>
Mommy, are prosecutors bad people?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The defense has a request. We ask that the witness provide an ACCURATE testimony.
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
What's that, Rookie?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
In your testimony... You stated that Lana Skye planned this murder. And that's why she was wearing those special gloves.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Seems like a natural conclusion to me! The gloves do indicate planning...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
However! Why would she not also prepare the most important thing... <span style="color:#E16935">the murder weapon</span>!?

Bah! The prosecution could care less if it was premeditated or not. The only one who seems to care is that lunchlady over there.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The defendant, Lana Skye, murdered a detective with a knife. That is the only thing the prosecution need prove. Nothing else.
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
Very good, Mr. Prosecutor... I suppose you think you're clever now? But you know as well as I do that she planned on killing him! It was planned! If it wasn't, why would she have been wearing...

The witness is clearly not suited for detective work.
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
W-what!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The suspect was not wearing a scarf or muffler of any kind when she stabbed the victim. And you've proved it yourself! With this photograph!

He wasn't in the station, so I waited. I witnessed the crime from the glass-walled station... and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself running towards the scene. But... the door was locked.

Our witness is more devious than I gave her credit for! We were hoodwinked to the very end! But she slipped! There is one vital hint to the truth in her testimony...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Wh-what are you talking about?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Think back to when she told us about apprehending the suspect...
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Angel:<br/>
The chief prosecutor tried to resist, but her efforts were in vain. She knocked my hands aside, kicked over an oil drum... Oh, she's beautiful, but deadly! A predator, this one! A leopard woman! Rowr!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I thought that was a strange thing for the normally cool-headed chief to do.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(No kidding!)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Now, witness. Allow me to ask a very simple question. This "oil drum"... was it empty?
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
... Oh, that, hmm? I'm not sure I like your attitude, Mr. Edgeworth. Though apparently you're not the slowest conveyor belt in the lunchbox factory.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Witness! W-well? Was the oil drum empty...?
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
The oil drum kicked over by the chief prosecutor... was brimming with water.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
W-water? <span style="color:#0070C0">(What does that mean?)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Still don't get it, Mr. Wright? Do you want to know the reason she knocked it over? The REAL reason?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Aaaa haaaaah! You don't mean...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Yes, the suspect knocked over that oil drum for one reason and one reason alone! To erase the blood stains that would become evidence against her!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Whaaaaaaaaargh!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
That ties things up quite nicely! The blood stains left on the victim's shoes tie her quite clearly to this murder! Then, after the deed was done, she knocked over the oil drum to erase the telltale signs!
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
Why, that's a prosecutor's specialty... erasing evidence!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That reminds me... Ms. Skye's right hand was hurt... Didn't she say she'd cut herself when she stabbed him...?)</span>
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
So my sister's blood on the shoe... That's when it happened?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well... I see no reason to prolong this trial.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
M-Mr. Wright! Do something! Please!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
W-what!? What can I do? Your sister has confessed to the crime, and she tried to conceal it!

The problem in this photograph... is here!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
What's this...? There's something poking out of <span style="color:#E16935">the car's muffler</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Wait just a moment, Mr. Edgeworth!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Your Honor?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You just said "<span style="color:#E16935">muffler</span>"... However I see no trace of a muffler or scarf of any kind in this photograph!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
... A muffler is also a part on a car or motorcycle, Your Honor. Just think of it as... part of the exhaust system. A pipe...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I see! And... I see! What's that suspicious-looking cloth sticking out of the car's muffler?
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
Hmph! So what if there is something sticking out of the muffler! What does that have to do with this case? Nothing! Absolutely nothing!

Sorry, Ms. Starr... But it's not going to be that easy! In fact, you've already told us why this is important to the case... You said as much in your testimony!!!

Wh-what!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Let's hear what Mr. Wright has on his mind! Tell us why you think this piece of cloth in the muffler is related to this case.

Ms. Starr! Recall your testimony for the court...
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Angel:<br/>
Ah yes. When I arrested her, she mentioned <span style="color:#E16935">the muffler</span>! That's what had me confused in my earlier testimony!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Angel:<br/>
<span style="color:#E16935">Muffler</span>! Argh! Yeearrrrgh!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Could it be that the "muffler" you heard mentioned... Was actually <span style="color:#E16935">this exhaust pipe</span>!? If so! That means this piece of cloth is vital evidence!

Oh... Whoooooooooooooooooooooooragh!

<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Well... It seems we will have to suspend the proceedings.
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
Sus... Suspend!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I find myself wondering about that piece of cloth. If we leave any question unanswered here we do a disservice to the law! Have the car at the crime scene inspected at once, and bring me that cloth! The verdict will wait until after we've seen all the evidence. Agreed...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
... I suppose so.

Um... Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh? What?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Are trials... always like this with you? Like you're swimming up from the bottom of a lake, about to reach the surface... But no matter how hard you paddle you never seem to get there...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Pretty much. Except today we're swimming in quicksand. So what happened to your sister, anyway?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Apparently she got called off to the judge's chambers.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Hmm... Probably something to do with that piece of cloth.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
So! This is where we turn this trial around, right? Our only weapon, a tiny, insignificant piece of cloth!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I'm the one who's starting to feel tiny and insignificant to tell the truth.

Hola, Pardner!
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
They say you show a red cloth to a bull, it'll fire up its temper! That's what they told me when I was a young'un, at least.

Officer Marshall!

Don't you got enough on your plate without worrying about other people, compadre? You could be worrying about the chief prosecutor's taste in mufflers, for example.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Um... Officer Marshall? The whole "muffler" thing didn't have anything to do with scarves... She wasn't even wearing a scarf!
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
You don't say? Now don't that just beat all.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
...?
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
I've seen the red breeze blow at her slender neck many a time... I saw it that day, too. She was wearing a <span style="color:#E16935">red muffler</span>.

At the awards ceremony that afternoon. Edgeworth's seen it too, I'd reckon.
