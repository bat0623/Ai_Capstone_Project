She was strong... She'd do anything to become a defense attorney. Anything. That... was probably why she was attracted to me.

You're a defense attorney, right? You should know then. You should know the foul misdeeds of the evil ones who haunt this den of inequity!
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
E-evil ones?
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
Prosecutors! They have no qualms at all about blackening the name of innocents! And yesterday they paid homage to the most evil one of all! They gave an award for "King of Prosecutors"... What a farce!
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
So, she's saying... There was some sort of prosecutor's convention yesterday.
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
I was almost compelled to lace their lunches with something foul...
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Do you have a personal grievance against prosecutors, or something? Or is there some kind of scientific evidence of this, um, "evil"?

Young miss... Mock me at your own risk! You'll soon find out why they call me the "Cough-up Queen"!
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Ew!
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
The most heinous of all the evil ones, the one they awarded yesterday... It was in his car that they found the body! Proof that he devours the evilest lunches of all!

I come here every day to sell lunches. I import only the freshest and best from the Far East. For some reason, the box lunches are a hit here.

I'm Edgeworth. What is it?

I'm here, sir, at the request of the Chief, sir! I've got your report, sir!

Sir! But, but sir! I'm just following orders, sir! They told me to bring this to you! I wasn't aware of the peculiars of your arrangement with us, sir!

U-uh, yes... yes, Sir! M-M-Meekins, sir. Officer Meekins!

Right. Officer Meekins? Take your report and leave. And good luck with that raise next month.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The victim was a detective from the same department as that patrolman just now. Go down to the Police Department. You can ask more there.

U-uh... Thanks. <span style="color:#0070C0">(He seems to have finally calmed down at least.)</span>

But I know the truth, pal! Nobody wants to be the one who has to prosecute the chief prosecutor! Mr. Edgeworth is biting the bullet on this one! He's doing this for all of us!

</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Whose phone is this, anyway? It was on the ground over there...
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
Whose is it? That belongs to Chief Prospector Skye.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
What? It's my sister's!?
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
She apparently dropped it when she was taken into custody, right after the crime. Look... the last call was made right when the murder occurred! Looks like she was fixing to call someone. Except she only spoke for a few seconds, according to this.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Who did she call!?
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
No idea. Sorry, pardner. Now, I got a question for you, pardner. I heard a phone ring just now... one of those new-fangled ring-tunes.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Oh? That? Oh... I'm sorry, that was my phone.
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
W-w-what!? Your phone!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah, uh, it's kind of strange, but... Someone called me right as we picked up the other phone, a wrong number...
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
... I hope you're not lying... They shoot you for that in Texas, pardner!

</p><p>Ema:<br/>
So... you think we'll be okay?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well, the only thing still bothering me is that Lana is confessing to the crime. She says she did it!
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
No problem! I can guarantee that she's not the criminal.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Oh by the way, Ema?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Yes?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I know that song your phone plays when it rings...
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
What...?
</p><p>Cellular:<br/>

Phoenix:<br/>
It's the Steel Samurai theme song, isn't it? That popular TV show... for kids?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The phone that just rang wasn't mine... It was yours. At 5:18, just after the murder took place... Your sister called you, didn't she, Ema?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
I... I'm sorry!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Can you tell me what you talked about?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
I... She hung up right away.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I see...
