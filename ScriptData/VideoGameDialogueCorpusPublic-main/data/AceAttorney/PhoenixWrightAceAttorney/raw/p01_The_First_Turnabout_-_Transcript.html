Oh, h-hiya, Chief.

Whew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Um... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
A favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Well, that's news to me!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.

<p>Phoenix:<br/>
My name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "<span style="color:#E16935">When something smells, it's usually the Butz.</span>" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!

Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm, um, a little nervous.

Your conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Thank... thank you, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.

Yes, Your Honor. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)</span>

The test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of <span style="color:#E16935">the defendant</span> in this case.

Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
Whaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!

Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Passport added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
Dude... no way...
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
Daddies? Sugar?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
Duuude!

We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, <span style="color:#E16935">what do you think of her now?</span>

<p>Sahwit:<br/>
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.<br/>
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.<br/>
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.<br/>
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!<br/>
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.<br/>
I thought to call the police immediately!<br/>
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.<br/>
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.<br/>
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.<br/>
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.

Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.

Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
!!! How do I prove he's not?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
You hold the key! It's in the <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span>! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand.

The victim had just returned home from abroad the day before the murder. As we all know, the time difference between here and Paris is nine hours! When it's 4:00 PM here, it's 1:00 AM the next day there. The clock wasn't three hours slow, it was nine hours fast! The victim hadn't reset her clock since returning home! That's why the time you heard when you struck her dead in her apartment was wrong! Proof enough for you, Mr. Sahwit? Or should I say... Mr. Did It!
</p><p>Sahwit:<br/>
Ngh! ...!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
O-order! Order, I say!

Very well. Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I have to say, I'm impressed. I don't think I've ever seen someone complete a defense so quickly... ...and find the true culprit at the same time!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Thank you, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
At this point, this is only a formality, but... This court finds the defendant, Mr. Larry Butz...
</p>
<center><b>Not Guilty</b></center>
<p><br/>
Judge:<br/>
And with that... This court is adjourned.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
It turns out that Frank Sahwit was a common burglar! He posed as a newspaper sales-man to check and see when people were out of the house! That day... When Larry went to her apartment, the victim wasn't home. After he left, Mr. Sahwit let himself in to do his dirty work! While he was searching her place, the victim returned! Flustered, Mr. Sahwit grabbed the nearest blunt object he could find...

Wright? I hope you see the importance of evidence now. Also, hopefully you realize, things change depending on how you look at them. People, too. We never really know if our clients are guilty or innocent. All we can do is believe in them. And in order to believe in them, you have to believe in yourself. Wright... Listen. Learn. Grow strong. Never let go of what you believe in. Never.

Well, I think our work here is done! Shall we be off?

Oh, speaking of Harry... You were saying part of why you became a lawyer was because of him.

Er, yeah. Part, at least.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
You'll have to tell me more about it sometime! Maybe... over drinks?

<p>Phoenix:<br/>
And so, my first trial came to a close. Larry slapped me on the back and said, "Gee, Nick, it's good to have friends!" But I'm pretty sure he's not going to pay us. Unless you count the clock he gave Mia. ... I didn't know it then... ...but that clock was soon going to be at the center of another incident. And my promise to tell the chief about me and Larry... ...would be one promise that I wouldn't be able to keep.
