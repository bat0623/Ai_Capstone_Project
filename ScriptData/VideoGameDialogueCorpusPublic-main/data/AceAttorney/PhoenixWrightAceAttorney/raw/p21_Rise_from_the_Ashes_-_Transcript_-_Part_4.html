I think the prosecution is as confused as we are. After all...

</p><p>Lana:<br/>
Good morning, Mr. Wright. I apologize for yesterday. I was... indisposed.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I hope they didn't hold you too long for questioning.
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
We just finished, actually. I'm used to all-nighters, though.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
So, how'd it go?
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
It's as Mr. Wright suspects. The police are clueless. I figured as much, so I struck a plea bargain.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
A plea bargain? What do you mean by that?
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
We agreed that if I told them the truth behind this "simultaneous murder," they wouldn't seek capital punishment. That's what I mean, Ema.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
But Lana! Don't tell me you...
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
Much to my regret, I'm as much in the dark about this as they are.

Ms. Skye.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That's the trump card I have up my sleeve today. You do understand what this means, don't you?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>

The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>

</p><p>Judge:<br/>
But, that's not physically possible, is it? What's more, I hear the victim from the evidence room just "disappeared"!
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Yes, and the body eventually reappeared in the trunk of Mr. Edgeworth's car.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Wow... this is one messed up trial...)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
One of my duties as prosecutor is to present impartial evidence. Today I will present evidence relating to the murder at the Police Department. In so doing, I believe the way in which we should proceed will reveal itself.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Now that's what sets Mr. Edgeworth apart. He sounds so on top of things... even though he doesn't know what's going on himself!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
And that's supposed to be an admirable trait?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well, let the trial resume. On the day of the crime, what exactly transpired at <span style="color:#E16935">the Police Department</span>? Mr. Edgeworth, you may call your first witness of the day to the stand.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
For its first witness, the prosecution calls... the suspect of the murder that occurred at the Police Department!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The suspect!? You mean, the so-called murderer!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hoo boy. Things are getting wild from the get-go.)</span>

<p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Will the witness please state his name and occupation.

Yes, sir! I am Officer Mike Meekins, sir! My occupation is, um... that would be murderer, sir!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
... Er... So you're telling us you're a "professional killer"...
</p><p>Meekins:<br/>
Sir. It was me, sir! I'm the one who did it! I'll never kill anyone again, sir! You've got to believe me, sir!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Uh... Actually, what we'd like to hear from you is...
</p><p>Meekins:<br/>
Sir! I'm what you would call part of the "younger generation," sir! A person whose actions adults can't possibly comprehend!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Please, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Help me, sir!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Officer Meekins.
</p><p>Meekins:<br/>
Y-yes, sir!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Give us your report of the crime. Consider that an order.
</p><p>Meekins:<br/>
Yes, sir! As you wish! After all, I am part of a generation that must be told what to do, sir!

After the awards ceremony finished that day, there were so many people running around that I relocated the Blue Badger to the evidence room!

Oh... So that's why you went to the evidence room.

<p><i>After pressing all statements:</i>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I believe we now have a fairly accurate picture of what happened.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Yes, Your Honor. Only one thing remains unclear. Was the man this officer "murdered," really the victim?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He's got a point...)</span>
</p><p>Meekins:<br/>
Um...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes, Officer Meekins?
</p><p>Meekins:<br/>
With regard to that, sir... <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [Take a look at this.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The Chief?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Delivered it...?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What is that? A... videotape?
</p><p>Meekins:<br/>
Yes, sir! That's absolutely right, sir! A videotape, sir! It contains footage from the <span style="color:#E16935">security camera</span> in the evidence room.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
What!? But I specifically asked if there was such a tape, and was told it had been mistakenly erased!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
That's quite a mistake.
</p><p>Meekins:<br/>
I just do what I'm told, sir. It's the only thing I'm really good at.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Looks like communication with the Police Department is as good as ever...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well then, let's have a look! Show us the video of you murdering the victim!
</p><p>Meekins:<br/>
Oh... Please stop using that word, "murder," sir! It scares me!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(A video of a real murder... Just what are we getting ourselves into...?)</span>

</p><p>Meekins:<br/>

</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well, I believe we're all thinking the same thing. How can we deal with these unsettling feelings stirred within us...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
What the hell was that wriggling piece of plywood!?
</p><p>Meekins:<br/>
Sir! That is the pride and joy of the entire Criminal Affairs Department, sir! It's the Blue Badger, sir!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Security Video added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes, well anyway... this tape seems to prove that that the witness did indeed encounter... er, "someone" in the evidence room, and some sort of... er, "activity" did take place...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Your Honor... instead of relying on clearly incomplete footage, the witness's testimony will suffice. Is that alright with you, Officer Meekins?
</p><p>Meekins:<br/>
Yes, sir! As you wish, sir!

<p>Meekins:<br/>
His face can't be clearly seen in the video,<br/>
but there's no question that the other person was Detective Goodman, sir!<br/>
I mean, he opened the locker, which required Detective Goodman's fingerprint to do!<br/>
The locker he opened is unquestionably Detective Goodman's locker, sir!<br/>
So it must be him! No one else could have unlocked it!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
What's this about a fingerprint?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Each detective has been given a locker, equipped with a fingerprint-activated lock. These locks ensure that each locker can only be opened by the detective it belongs to.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Intriguing... That would mean... the victim at the crime scene would have to have been Detective Goodman. Very well! The defense may begin its cross-examination!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

S-sir! If you must label people as having "<span style="color:#E16935">seen</span>" or "<span style="color:#E16935">not seen</span>" the man's face... I believe I would be classified as... the latter?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The latter? But you were standing right in front of him, were you not?

More to the point, you are the person who fought him, aren't you?

Oh, yes sir! But... I didn't get a clear look at his face, sir. I'm not the kind of guy who looks directly at people when talking with them, you see...

Regarding the video contained on this tape, there is one thing in particular that seems rather strange.

Regarding the video contained on this tape, there is one thing in particular that seems rather strange.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Strange?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
This contradiction leads to the possibility that... <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [the man may not be Detective Goodman.] in the original release">the man may not have been Detective Goodman.</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [the man may not be Detective Goodman.] in the original release)</span>

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Interesting... Your Honor, I have a proposal.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes, Mr. Edgeworth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I propose we have the defense... point out to us this alleged "<span style="color:#E16935">contradiction</span>" in the video.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He would want me to point it out...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well, proposal accepted. Let us further inspect this piece of evidence. I will now play the security tape. Mr. Wright. Please show us this contradiction you speak of.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I have to point out a problem in <span style="color:#E16935">the video</span>? This is the first time I've ever had to do that.)</span>

</p><p>Meekins:<br/>
Please don't play it too many times. I-I can't stand watching this video!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Now then, Mr. Wright. Please enlighten us! Where is the contradiction that indicates the man may not be Detective Goodman?

Sir! D-do you mean me, sir?

As I understand it, the locker apparatus works like this: <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [When you grab the handle, a sensor reads your fingerprint.

</p><p>Meekins:<br/>
A-according to my very limited experience, that's the way I understand it, sir!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
If so, then something is seriously wrong with this picture! When the victim reaches for the handle to open the locker... Let's rewind to a little earlier... Here! Notice the light?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What's this!? It's... already lit!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Precisely my point, Your Honor. The locker was already open before the victim grabbed the handle!
</p><p>Meekins:<br/>
AAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! What's the meaning of this!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It's very simple, Your Honor. The locker wasn't locked on the day of the crime!

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
But the locker locks are controlled by an electronic system. When a door is shut, a sensor is triggered... and the locker is automatically locked!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Oh, I know! It must have broken down! Of course, I'm not an expert in this...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
That's not likely, Your Honor. The sensor would detect and report any malfunction.

Oh well. It just goes to show novices should keep their mouths shut. So then, Mr. Wright. Do you have an explanation?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Me, Your Honor?

Yes. Why wasn't the locker locked?

<p>Meekins:<br/>
There's one other thing that proves the man was Detective Goodman, sir!<br/>
To enter the evidence room, one must use their ID card!<br/>
When an ID card is used, there's a record of it!<br/>
At the time of the crime, the detective had used his card!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
An ID card record. I see...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I have the ID card record right here, Your Honor. The ID used at 5:14... is that of the victim.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Just before the crime, hmm? Yes, without a doubt this is the victim's ID! However, one thing does strike me as unusual... Several hundred cases should have been due for transferal. Why were there so few people using this room?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
This particular evidence room is only used for storing certain special cases.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
"Special" cases...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Extremely violent cases involving police staff.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Just hearing that makes my hair stand on end!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Me too, although it doesn't make much of a difference...)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
There were only a few cases up for transferal there, and most were cleared up by noon.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Right... I see. Now, Let us move on to the cross-examination.

</p><p>Meekins:<br/>
... Maybe I shouldn't wear it around my neck... Remember when I said two out of three times my tie gets stuck in my car door when I get out? Well, the remaining time my ID card gets stuck. Instead of the door closing, my ID card chokes me!

At any rate, each police officer has only one ID card. Both the Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office can attest to this.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(The problem with this ID card testimony is far too obvious. It's not like Edgeworth to miss something like this...)</span>
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
You're thinking too hard about it. Come on, let's show them what we've got!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wait one moment, Officer Meekins.
</p><p>Meekins:<br/>
I-I'm not good at waiting, sir!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I have the victim's ID card right here. I found it at <span style="color:#E16935">the crime scene</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
That makes sense.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
When I say, "crime scene," I'm not referring to the evidence room at the Police Department. I mean the "other" crime scene... The underground parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Your Honor... I have one more piece of evidence to present. It's a very important clue regarding the victim's ID card.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
A... Lost Item Report? It's only half completed.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But it shows that Detective Goodman had lost "something" on the day of the crime. Something important enough to fill out this report.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Let me guess. You believe this "something" to be his ID card, right?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I can't say for sure... but there is a high probability! On the day of the crime, Detective Goodman was not carrying his card!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! So now... what does this all mean?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It can only mean one thing. It doesn't require much thought! The man Officer Meekins encountered in the evidence room... was not Detective Goodman, but rather the man who stole his ID card!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! Order! Does the prosecution have a response?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
... I have only one thing to say to the defense.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Bravo, Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
B-bravo...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Allow me to summarize the defense's argument. At 5:15 PM on the day of the crime, <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [the man Officer Meekins encountered in the evidence room was not Detective Goodman.] in the original release">the man in the evidence room Officer Meekins encountered was not Detective Goodman.</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [the man Officer Meekins encountered in the evidence room was not Detective Goodman.] in the original release)</span> There are two grounds to support this. First, the locker in the evidence room was already <span style="color:#E16935">unlocked</span>. Second, the victim <span style="color:#E16935">lost his ID card</span>. Am I correct so far, Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes... <span style="color:#0070C0">(What's he up to?)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
That being the case, we must inevitably arrive at a single conclusion: If the "victim" in this video is a <span style="color:#E16935">fake</span>... then the murder in the evidence room is also <span style="color:#E16935">fake</span>! In other words, the security camera does not show the instant of the murder.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Uh... Th-that is... Well, I guess that's right...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Is something wrong, Mr. Wright? Only moments ago you seemed content to be pointing your finger around.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [This isn't good...] in the original release">This isn't going to end well...</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [This isn't good...] in the original release)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Well, well... It seems you've finally realized... exactly what you've gone to such lengths to prove!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Explain yourself, Mr. Edgeworth!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The defense has already done the explaining for me. The victim in this video is a <span style="color:#E16935">fake</span>... which means a murder did not take place at the Police Department at 5:15 on the day of the crime.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
So...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
So the real crime could only take place at one location: the underground parking lot at the Prosecutor's Office! The murderer being Ms. Lana Skye, the defendant! The evidence is compelling! A trustworthy witness... observed the moment the defendant used the murder weapon!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Aaaah!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I knew that testimony was way too shabby. It was all a trap from the beginning!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The activity in the evidence room still leaves many questions unanswered: Who exactly was the "victim" Officer Meekins encountered? And where did this person disappear to...? However... This trial's purpose is to examine only the murder of Detective Goodman.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Just so, Your Honor.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Mr. Wright! You have to do something, or else Lana...

What are you talking about?

How exactly did you "keep an eye" on the evidence room?
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
I just made sure nothing moved in the security camera monitor. That room's so still, even time dies in there. I was just a caretaker who interred the recordings.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You "interred" them?
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
Videos of nothing aren't that useful. When the time would come, I'd erase the tape.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
If nothing unusual is recorded, tapes are to be erased every six hours.
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
Each time I'd erase a tape, it felt like I was erasing a part of my life.

I assure you this is no joke, Officer Marshall. Now then, please tell us what you were doing in the evidence room at the time of the crime?
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Olé! Please answer the question!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What is he now, a bullfighter?)</span> That's alright, Officer Marshall. I believe we can figure the rest out from here.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
We can?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Have a look at these floor plans. There is no place for someone to hide in the evidence room. Yet, Officer Meekins didn't see Officer Marshall.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
If that's so, then... where was the witness?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It seems Mr. Wright has an answer.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's right. The only possible conclusion!)</span>

May I point out though, that Officer Meekins did not know Detective Goodman. He also testified about the man's reaction when confronted.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Meekins:<br/>
When I entered the evidence room, I asked him to show his card, sir!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes? And how did Detective Goodman respond?
</p><p>Meekins:<br/>
He suddenly pulled a knife on me!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
Something about the officer's story puzzled me. If the man had had his ID card, why didn't he just show it?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes, he would have needed it to enter the evidence room, so he must have been carrying it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The answer is simple. He couldn't show it.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
As you can see, <span style="color:#E16935">Detective Goodman's picture</span> is on his ID card.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Oh, I get it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
If he showed that, his cover would have been blown! Officer Meekins would have realized the man wasn't Detective Goodman. Do you have anything to say to this, Officer Marshall?
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
... You've got quite an imagination, pardner. We got a term for that. It's called "circumstantial evidence."
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Circumstantial evidence...? <span style="color:#0070C0">(He's still denying it!)</span>
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
You're gonna have to do better than that to break a detective. Unless you have hard evidence proving I dressed up as the victim...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... I can't say I particularly care for your uncooperative disposition...
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
I can't say I care for your beard, but you don't see me complainin'.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well, Mr. Wright? Do you have any evidence? Any evidence proving beyond the shadow of a doubt that Officer Marshall dressed up as the victim?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Who am I kidding? I don't have anything like that...)</span>
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
I can see the fear in your eyes, pardner. Seems you're the one who couldn't take the desert heat!

Ack! <span style="color:#0070C0">(This can't be happening! It's so obvious he's the one! What can I do...?)</span>

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I'll pass onto you what someone told me when I was just starting out. When you've run into a wall with no place to go, return to the basics.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Why do you think this locker was opened in the first place?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What do you mean?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
There's no reason for Officer Marshall to open his locker at the time of the crime. Yet he did, despite the chance that it might be discovered later as it has been.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Which means he didn't originally plan to open his locker...!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
According to the defense's argument, Officer Jake Marshall dressed up as Detective Goodman at the time of the crime. Then, after the crime was "committed," he opened his own locker for some unknown reason.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The fact that a white "<span style="color:#E16935">cloth</span>" is sticking out of the locker seems to indicate that he opened it in order to put the cloth inside.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
So... just what exactly is this <span style="color:#E16935">piece of cloth</span>?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Perhaps... Perhaps the video is the key to all our unanswered questions. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I don't have any evidence, so this video's my only shot!)</span>
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well. Let's take yet another look at the security tape. After commiting the crime, the witness opened the locker to put away <span style="color:#E16935">the white cloth</span>. Please show us why the witness had to open his locker!

<span style="color:#0070C0">(I had a feeling we'd wind up here sooner or later... Everyone involved here is related in some way to that case... I'd better take another look at the files.)</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
Officer Marshall, I think I understand. I think I know why you care so much about the SL-9 Incident.
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
Sounds like you've been sipping too much cactus juice, pardner.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I have the SL-9 Incident file here. The name "Marshall" is mentioned in here...
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
In a list of murder victims. "Neil Marshall"... Are you related to this man?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Neil Marshall...?
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
Yeah, I'm sure you've heard the name. Two years ago... he received the same lousy prosecutor award you got.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What!? A prosecutor...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He must be talking about the King of Prosecutors award.)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Now I remember... Prosecutor Neil Marshall. He handled the SL-9 case before I did.
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
That's right. He was killed... and the case fell into your hands.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
But what's his relation to you...?
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
He was my brother. He was investigating the murders with Damon Gant, Chief Detective at the time. The group of detectives I was part of worked under them. We were desperate to prosecute the killer. Joe Darke... My brother fought Darke and was killed. That was the first time Darke left behind any evidence. That was all we needed. He was arraigned and incarcerated. The case was finally closed... at least, according to the public records.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What do you mean?
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
My brother couldn't have been killed by Joe Darke. I knew my brother better than anyone... No one could have beaten him in a fight.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
And that's it? That's your reason for your insane actions?
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
There's more to my brother's death than what the records say. No matter how much you try to hide it, you can't fool me.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well... at least one thing's for certain. Now we know what happened at the Police Department on the day of the crime.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
That was the last day the SL-9 case could be reopened. Not satisfied with its resolution, Officer Marshall planned to steal the evidence.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Disguising himself as Detective Goodman, he entered the evidence room. Officer Meekins confronted him, so he rendered him unconscious and fled.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Yes, this mystery has finally been cleared up. No murder took place at the Police Department that day!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The things that happen by chance never cease to amaze... At exactly the same time as the murder at the Prosecutor's Office... this fake murder was going on at the Police Department.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Chance...? It's got to be more than just that...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
So if no one was murdered at the Police Department on the day of the crime, that means the murder in the Prosecutor's Office's parking lot was the real one.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Which, in turn, means... only one person could have committed the crime: Chief Prosecutor Lana Skye.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Which is why we examined the incident at the Police Department today.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
There's only one reason the defendant was not convicted yesterday: there yet remained the mystery of the simultaneous murder at the Police Department.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

Mr. Wright. Are you this girl's guardian?

Please, Your Honor. All I'm asking is for a minute of your time! Please hear me out! Mr. Edgeworth, please...

<hr/>
<p>Ema:<br/>
I... I was kind of in shock. I mean, finding out that the SL-9 incident referred to the Joe Darke Killings!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Now that she mentions it... the names of both Skye sisters were in that file.)</span>
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
But that's when I figured it out. I mean, what Officer Marshall was trying to do that day... So I knew his fingerprint had nothing to do with the crime. That left only one thing... the other handprint!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
You mean the traces of blood found on Detective Gumshoe's locker...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
But no fingerprints were found on it, right?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
No, but I figured if I examined it scientifically... I'd be sure to find a clue! So I ran over there and looked at it again!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
! So did you find something?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Um... No!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Sorry. I guess I'm not much of a scientific investigator after all.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Um... Is that all?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Please don't be mad. I'm just a high school student!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(And I'm just an attorney...)</span>
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
But Mr. Wright! Those traces of blood are the only clue we have! If we can't find something wrong with them... Please, Mr. Wright. You're a professional. If anyone can save Lana, it's you!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Me? Oh boy...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Time's up. Now then, Mr. Wright. With regard to the incident at the Police Department... Does any reasonable doubt remain?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Um...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It appears the defense is troubled by the other blood mark. Looking at the floor plans, a handprint was discovered around here. Is there a problem with this?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Mr. Wright! I'm sorry I can't be of more use... But still! If you can't find anything wrong with that blood mark, Lana will be...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Please answer my question, Mr. Wright. We don't have all day.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Y-yes, Your Honor. <span style="color:#0070C0">(If ever I've needed to concentrate, it's now! What could be wrong with that handprint on Detective Gumshoe's locker? Could there be something I'm missing...?)</span>

What about that piece of plywood?

The Blue Badger! Mascot of the police force! Defender of truth, guardian of proof!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Explain yourself, Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Please look at the floor plans of the crime scene. The Blue Badger is not here.
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
So?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So watch what happens when we put him in. This is where he was dancing at the time of the crime. Well...?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well... what?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
! *gasp!*
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That's right. So long as the Blue Badger is dancing here... it would be impossible... to place a handprint at this spot on the locker!
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
Whaaaaat!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
So that means... Uh... just exactly what does that mean!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It means it can't be done!

Mr. Wright! Think it through scientifically!

On that afternoon... Officer Meekins was the one who brought the Blue Badger to the evidence room, right? After he put it down, it would be impossible to leave a handprint on that locker.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...! So that must mean this blood mark... was left there before the Blue Badger was brought in...?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Just one moment! I will not allow such farfetched balderdash in my courtroom!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It may sound farfetched, Your Honor... but it's the only possible explanation! On February 21st... in the Police Department's evidence room... blood was spilled not once, but twice!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
B-but how...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
One time was captured on this tape, taken by the security camera. Officer Meekins cut his hand, from which a trivial amount of blood fell. The problem is... the "other" time. Someone bled prior to the struggle shown on this tape. It had to have been... Detective Goodman, when he was really murdered!

If it's so simple, then don't get it wrong.

</p><p>Judge:<br/>
If "huh" was an acceptable excuse, we wouldn't need police.

The first crime took place before the Blue Badger was brought to the room, right? Say... When was the Blue Badger brought there, anyway?

An ID card... Oh! The ID Card Record!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Officer Meekins brought the Blue Badger panel into the evidence room at...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Let's see here... 4:50 PM. If the crime took place before that time, then it would be... 4:40 PM... Ah! AAAAAAAHHH! M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-Miles Edgeworth! Just what have you done!?

</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
Hmm... Nope, I ain't gettin' it...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... I'm afraid I don't understand either.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It's clear from the luminol test that blood was there. However, when the "second" crime took place... both Officer Meekins and Officer Marshall failed to notice the blood.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That means... the blood from the first crime was wiped away... by the real murderer.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I would have had just ten minutes to murder the victim, carry his body away, and clean up the blood... Unfortunately that's physically impossible.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
That would mean... the crime must have taken place before Mr. Edgeworth entered the evidence room.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Let's look at the chart again. There's only one other card number remaining: "7777777"!
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
Talk about a lucky number...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
But wait... That doesn't make sense! <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [How could Officer Goodman have entered the evidence room?] in the original release">How could Detective Goodman have entered the evidence room?</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [How could Officer Goodman have entered the evidence room?] in the original release)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Since there's no record of his card being used beforehand... he must have entered along with the real murderer. That's the only plausible explanation. He went in with "7777777"!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Edgeworth! Please look into this ASAP! Find out whose ID number is "sevensevensevensevensevensevensevenseven"!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
That's one "seven" too many, Your Honor. Unfortunately... I'm unable to look up the owner of that ID card. At least, at present.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What!?
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
Explain yourself, son.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The ID number "7777777" belongs to someone with a rank of Captain or higher... Someone who is a so-called "executive officer." We don't have the authority to inquire into such a person's identity.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I'm not finished talking, Mr. Wright. There is one situation in which we can be granted such authority.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
If an official charge filed against an executive is accepted.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
An "official charge"...
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
You're all alike, aren't you? With your "cover-ups" and your "forgeries"... That's how the Prosecutor's Office operates!

Yes?

No, not to you. To her, the defendant sitting over there. Your own little "executive."

Don't be stupid. She's been charged with murder. Of course we've looked up her ID number... and it's not "7777777."
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
Don't play me for a fool, pardner. That's not what I want to ask. All I want to know is one thing... about that incident.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The SL-9 Incident?
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
Answer me this, Chief Prosecutor! In that trial two years ago... Did you really only use legitimate evidence!?
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Do you need the witness to repeat his question, Chief Prosecutor?
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
I heard him fine, Mr. Edgeworth.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Two years ago... I was in charge of the prosecution for that trial. At the time, we...
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
Occasionally... we felt the powerlessness of the law. At least... I did.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
L-Lana...
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
I became a prosecutor in order to suppress crime with the law. But before I realized it, we were the ones being suppressed by the law.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Defendant! Just what are you saying!?
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
I'll ask you again, Chief Prosecutor. During that trial two years ago... did you really present all the evidence in court? Can you look me, an investigator in that crime, in the eye and say that you did?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Chief Prosecutor! You didn't...
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
... I don't have to, Officer Marshall.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
<span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [! Why don't you answer him!?] in the original release">!

</p><p>Lana:<br/>
Drastic crimes require drastic measures... That's just the way it is. We did what we had to... in order for him to get the verdict he deserved.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
But Lana!
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
Even if it involved "forging" evidence.
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
See? That's what I'm talking about.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
No... NNNNOOOOOOO!!!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! Order! ORDERRRRR!!!

<p>Lana's remarks caused such a stir... the chaos in the courtroom could not be quelled. The conclusion of the trial... would have to wait until the following day...
