Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This is the Defendant Lobby all right... but there's no defendant. I've been trying to reach Lana all morning. Where could she be? And where's Ema, for that matter? It almost seems as if...)</span>

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Edgeworth!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>

Well... I have a pretty strong hunch. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Looks like I'm not the only one who's figured it out.)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But she didn't do it!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I figured you'd say as much. That's why I came here... to hear what you have to say.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This is the first time he's ever done something like this...)</span> Lana's hiding something, and the only way we'll ever know the truth... is to draw it out of her.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The "truth"?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Everything goes back to <span style="color:#E16935">the SL-9 Incident</span>.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Don't be stupid! Today's the last day of the trial. We don't have time to reminisce about the past!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That depends on you.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
If she's found guilty, you'll lose your only chance to find out what really happened.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
... I'll think about it. See you in court, Wright.

<p><br/>
Judge:<br/>
Court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Lana Skye.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Normally this is when the prosecution puts forth its opening statement,
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
But before that, the police chief has a proposal to make.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Chief Gant...!)</span>
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
Mornin' folks. How's everyone doing? Hey, Udgey. Been back to the pool yet?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
No, I've been drowning enough as it is in my work.
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
Ho! That's a good one! Don't think I can top that!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
If you don't mind me asking, Chief, exactly what is this "proposal" of yours?
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
Lana... that is to say, the defendant, has asked me if she could speak directly to the court.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She wants to do what!?)</span>
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
Having heard what she intends to say, I feel she should be granted her request. In the end, it should save everyone a lot of time and trouble.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Edgeworth:<br/>
What's this all about, defendant?
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
I'd just like to make one simple request, and I'll be finished.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well then? What's your request?
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
Your Honor, I'd like you to put an immediate end to this trial.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh!?
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
I confess to all charges against me. On February 21 of this year, I murdered Detective Bruce Goodman... in the underground parking lot of the Prosecutor's Office.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
No, Lana!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You can't! Your Honor. The defendant's claim does not change the defense's plea!
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
In that case, Mr. Wright, I no longer require your services.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But Lana!
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
Your Honor. I hereby forfeit my right to an attorney. The prosecution may lack direct evidence against me, but it has sufficiently proven its case through testimony and circumstantial evidence. I would like you to render your verdict now, if you please.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... Well, the defendant certainly has the right to self representation... Her request is legally valid, although this is an unprecedented situation. <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [Indeed, it appears there's no need to continue this trial...] in the original release">Indeed, it appears there's no further need to continue this trial...</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [Indeed, it appears there's no need to continue this trial...] in the original release)</span> even if Mr. Wright may feel otherwise.

It appears the time for the verdict has arrived. This court finds the defendant...

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
One moment, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
M-Mr. Edgeworth!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The prosecution has not yet proven the defendant guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Any ruling at this stage would certainly be premature.
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
Come now, Worthy. I understand this is a difficult time for you, but why don't you just be a good little boy and keep your mouth shut, hmm?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Hmph. I don't think I care for your tone... Chief Gant.
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
What?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Creating another fabrication to cover up your past mistakes... Sorry, but I'm no longer the naive little "boy" you would have me be.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
With this sudden confession from the defendant... It's obvious to me some kind of deal was struck behind the scenes.
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
Some kind of "deal," hm? Not everyone operates as you do... Worthy.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
... Hmph. I thought so. Your Honor. The prosecution would like to change its first witness.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Oh? To whom...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
As its first witness, the prosecution would like to call... Ms. Ema Skye! I request the court hears her tesimony!
</p><p>Lana:<br/>

I don't care what you think, Ms. Skye.
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The exposure of truth sometimes results in tragedy... However! No matter how tragic the truth may be, it would be an even greater tragedy... to avert one's eyes from it.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well. The court shall grant the prosecution's request. That's okay with you, right Chief Gant?
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
Worthy... You'll live to regret this. Mark my words.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Ms. Ema Skye. Please take the stand.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Looks like Edgeworth has decided to take the horse by the reins!)</span>

<p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Now then, witness. Please state your name and occupation.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Um... M-my name is Ema. Ema Skye. My occupation? I'm Lana's little sister, and I want to be a scientific investigator!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Two years ago... you encountered the serial killer Joe Darke, of the "Joe Darke Killings." Is this correct?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Yes. I'm trying my hardest to forget about that, though...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to recall those events one more time.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Edgeworth. Please remember this trial concerns the murder of Detective Goodman. Is an incident that was resolved two years ago really all that relevant?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Yes. It most certainly is.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>

W-well okay then!

That's understandable. However... please tell me, Mr. Edgeworth. What does this testimony have to do with Detective Goodman's murder?

Yes, I remember. Chief Detective Gant and Ms. Skye used to be quite the pair.

When he saw his chance... he fled the room, right?

Upon fleeing the room, Darke proceeded to take the elevator. He must have been in a panic because the elevator was going up. Then he ran into Skye and Gant's office.

Neil Marshall had just received the King of Prosecutors award. Young and dedicated, he went straight to the questioning room after the ceremony.

Your Honor... Please allow me to once again go over the events that took place the day of the murder. The Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office were holding a ceremony that day. After receiving the King of Prosecutors award at the ceremony. Neil Marshall questioned Joe Darke along with Damon Gant. During his questioning, Joe Darke fled the room. Prosecutor Marshall chased after him... and was killed by Darke. It is my belief that somewhere in this story... there is a <span style="color:#E16935">lie</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm...
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
I... I'm not lying... The man really was holding up a broken knife!

... If that's true... then there's no other way around it. This could not have been the actual murder weapon.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

When I saw that man raise his knife...<br/>
I panicked, and rushed toward both of them.<br/>
I think I... I knocked away the man with the knife.<br/>
Just then there was another flash of lightning, and that's when I saw... the Blue Badger!<br/>
He wasn't in the room, but I'm sure I saw his shadow!

The location of the jar is shown in a picture taken on the day of the crime. It's on a shelf in the office of Damon Gant.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes! And it is these two facts that reveal what actually transpired! You see... The struggle between Darke and Marshall did not take place in Lana Skye's office! It happened on the other side of the room, in <span style="color:#E16935">Chief Gant's office</span>!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
<span class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:File"><a class="mw-file-description image" href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445"><img class="mw-file-element lazyload" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" decoding="async" height="192" loading="lazy" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" width="260"/></a></span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Are you implying the murderer moved the victim's body? From Damon Gant's office to Lana Skye's office?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Why would he do that!? There's no reason!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Exactly.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
If there wasn't a "reason"... he wouldn't have gone through the trouble. The only logical conclusion... is that there was a "<span style="color:#E16935">reason</span>."
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Do you know what that reason was, Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I've finally figured it out... So this is why Lana tried to stop the trial! It's too late to quit now, though.)</span> Please recall the witness's testimony. She said she knocked away the man who was holding up the knife. In the next instant, the jar was hit and flew threw the air. Now tell me... What could have sent the jar flying?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
That would have to have been... the impact the man made when he was knocked into the wall?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Ladies and gentlemen... if I may draw your attention to this picture once more. If the man was knocked in the direction of the shelf the jar was sitting on... what would he have hit?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
A-AHHHHHH...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The suit of <span style="color:#E16935">armor</span>! Holding... a very sharp and dangerous-looking sword...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes. And since the man who was knocked into the armor was carrying a <span style="color:#E16935">broken knife</span>... <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [he would have had to have been Neil Marshall, wielding the Prosecutor's Award.] in the original release">he would have had to have been <span style="color:#E16935">Neil Marshall</span>, wielding the King of Prosecutors Trophy.</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [he would have had to have been Neil Marshall, wielding the Prosecutor's Award.] in the original release)</span>

Yes. There is <span style="color:#E16935">another possibility</span> of what actually transpired in that room.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Another possibility?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Of course the perpetrator would have had no idea, but nevertheless! ... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I... I don't know if I can go through with this...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Wright? What's the matter?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
If events took place as the defense theorizes... then the outcome is obvious. In that moment... assuming the man Ema Skye knocked away was actually <span style="color:#E16935">Prosecutor Neil Marshall</span>...
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
You mean... Mr. Marshall died... because of... me...? NOOOOOOOOOO!!!

I never imagined her testimony would lead to this...

</p><p>Lana:<br/>
What... What are you saying!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I'm sorry, Ms. Skye, but given the circumstances...
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
Joe Darke murdered Prosecutor Marshall! How can you think it was Ema!? How dare you try to pin the crime on her!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Imagine that, coming from you.
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
If you recall, it was you who admitted to forging evidence two years ago. The reason you moved Prosecutor Marshall's body... was to keep anyone else from finding out about what Ema did, wasn't it?
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
I assure you, Mr. Edgeworth, I have no idea what you're talking about. If you hope to have anyone believe your insane allegations, I'm afraid you're going to have to have proof. Tell me... Do you have any conclusive evidence that proves my sister killed Neil Marshall?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
E-evidence?
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
I'm willing to bet you don't.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes... it certainly would be difficult to prove this with evidence.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
If we don't have evidence, then we'll have to rely on testimony.
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
I'm afraid that won't work in this case. Both parties involved in the incident are dead.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(We certainly can't get dead people to testify. This has all been a wild goose chase from the beginning!)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Hmph. Touché, Ms. Skye. Of course... That only leaves us with one possibility.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(You mean, there's still another possibility?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I mean, the possibility that <span style="color:#E16935">the victim left us a message</span>. For better or for worse, Mr. Marshall did not die instantly. He may have left behind the name of the person who took his life... <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [somehow.] in the original release">in one manner or another.</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [somehow.] in the original release)</span>
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
That's... That's impossible!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well, Mr. Wright? This is the only possibility left to you. A <span style="color:#E16935">message from the deceased</span>... Does such a message exist?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I've got to think back to the Court Record!)</span> The real murderer's name that the victim may have left behind...

See, Worthy? Can't say I didn't warn you.

Chief Gant...
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
Do you understand the implications of what you've done?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
What...? What are you talking about?
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
Two years ago, Joe Darke was sentenced to death. He was convicted because of his final murder. I believe you were the prosecutor in the case, were you not?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Ack!
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
Yes, Worthy. Because of you... an innocent man was sentenced to death. Not only that... but you used forged evidence to ensure his conviction!

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But Joe Darke really was a serial murderer! That's undeniable!
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
I'm afraid that's not important. Didn't you know? We aren't defenders of justice.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What?
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
We're merely keepers of the law. Sentencing a man to death... is no light matter. Even if there wasn't any cover-up or evidence forgery... ultimately the responsibility falls on the prosecutor in charge.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>

</p><p>Gant:<br/>
Despite what anyone may say, this fact cannot be denied.

You're missing the point, Detective. Lana didn't murder Detective Goodman.

Is that true, Edgeworth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Yes... He was going to be made Chief anyway.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Gah!
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
Be careful when pointing that finger... or you might wind up being the one pointed at!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
So that means... there's only one possible motivation for you to commit forgery. If you didn't do it for yourself... then you did it for someone else.
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
Don't be silly, Worthy. You know me better than that. There are only three people I look out for: Me, Myself and I. ... There, it's out in the open now. Udgey, would you mind if I changed my testimony a little?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
By all means, please do!

<p>Judge:<br/>
Chief Prosecutor Lana Skye... Th-the defendant!?
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I believe it's quite obvious in light of the circumstances. Ema Skye fell victim to an unfortunate series of events. Who would want to help her more than her own sister, Lana? And as for Chief Gant... he would also have a reason to help Lana if she asked him to. That reason, of course, is... self-profit.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Self-profit...? What do you mean?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
After the SL-9 Incident was resolved... Lana Skye was appointed Chief Prosecutor at the Prosecutor's Office. The person who arranged this job change...was you, Chief Gant.
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
B-but... how would he profit from all of this?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
He would be able to use the Chief Prosecutor as his puppet! Essentially... he would acquire unchecked authority over all investigations!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Do you mean to tell me... that despite the Chief's formidable appearance, he plays with puppets!? Oh, wait. You must mean "puppet" as in someone forced to do his bidding... Never mind!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Admit it, Chief! You assisted Lana Skye in forging evidence! Your motive: to appoint her as Chief Prosecutor so you could control her!
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
Wrighto, my boy. You have quite an imagination. Let me ask you something.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What?
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
Do you have any proof of this? That I "controlled" Lana? For example, is Lana testifying that I've done such a thing?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Lana... <span style="color:#0070C0">(She's keeping quiet to protect Ema. There's no way she'd testify against Gant!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I'm afraid without any proof, this all amounts to nothing more than mere conjecture.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
... Unless... that is also what happened in this incident...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
"This" incident...? Er... which one would that be?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Of course I'm talking about... the murder of Detective Bruce Goodman. The Chief Prosecutor has been acting strange throughout this entire trial. Almost as if... someone has been "controlling" her!
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
Worthy... You'd better watch your tongue... I wouldn't want you to get hurt.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Just what do you mean?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What he means, Your Honor, is that Chief Gant is involved in the murder of Detective Goodman. Not only that... but the Chief is now making Lana take the rap to cover up his involvement!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Wha... wha... wha... WWWHHHHAAAAAAAAATTTTT!!!? Order! Order! Order! I SAID... ORDEEEEERRRR!!! Mr. Wright! You... You can't be serious!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
This... This is an affront to the highest ranking officer in our law enforcement agency! To accuse the Chief of Police of blackmail... and murder!!!? That's i.... i... i-i-i-i-i-i-i-IMPOSSIBLE!!!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
... Your Honor, I was merely reiterating... what Mr. Edgeworth said, in easier-to-understand language.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It's too late, Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
There's no turning back for us now.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(It looks like he's the one who's decided to go through with this.)</span>

Detective Goodman lost his ID card on the day of the crime.

Or to be more accurate, Jake Marshall stole it.

So Detective Goodman filled out a lost item report. He would have had to give that report... to the Chief of Police!

Yet you are in possession of the report... which means you can't be sure if he filed it.

He needed to?

Yes. To transfer the evidence out.

Detective Goodman took the form to you, Chief Gant. Then... you accompanied the detective to the evidence room!

There's no other way the murderer and Detective Goodman could have entered the room!

That's right... Your sister will be found guilty... for Neil Marshall's murder!

Of course, you'd never support such outrageous claims anyway... right? Just something to think about... All right, then. I've got a lunch date to meet.

Hmph. Settle down, Wright. Remember what the judge said?

"Risks"... What did he mean by that?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It's simple. If the Chief refuses to testify... the opposite also holds true.

You mean, he forfeits his right to say anything too!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Ema! Are you okay?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Yeah. When I came to, I was in the medical office. I've been listening to the trial from the gallery.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So she heard everything that's been going on.)</span> Um, Ema... I'm sorry for what I said before.

No, don't be. It was the truth. You know, it's funny. I almost feel somehow... relieved.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
"Relieved"?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Yeah... Now I finally know what really happened. To think that all this time... my sister was being blackmailed by that terrible man! And she did it all... just to protect me.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Ever since her appointment as Chief Prosecutor, everyone who knew her... said she changed. Perhaps... it was easier that way for her.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
What do you mean?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
What do you think I mean? To follow Chief Gant's orders. She must have shut herself up deep inside... to force herself to do anything and everything the Chief told her to do.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That must be why she became so cold...)</span>
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
It was all my fault. It's all because I... I murdered Mr. Marshall.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Hey. Don't go blaming yourself, now. If you want to blame anyone, blame society, pal!
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Chief Gant may be able to fool everyone else with his "forgery," but he can't fool my memory. I remember now. I knocked Mr. Marshall into that armor.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I... I see.

Well, we'd better get back. It's time for the final act!

"Pieces of the jar..." You mean...?
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
Yes. That wretched jar Mr. Wright showed us earlier. In order to show that Darke committed the crime... I felt it would be more expedient to move the body.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
So... when you first found the body, the jar was already...
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
Of course. It had been shattered to pieces. If you looked at the crime scene, it would be clear right away what happened. Neil Marshall was dead, and Darke was lying unconscious... In other words, the jar must have been broken during their struggle.

I see.

It's a simple oversight, really. You see, a message was written on this jar with the victim's blood.

Yes. The prosecutor must have written it in his final moments.

Exactly so. And this is where the contradiction lies.

Have you forgotten, Your Honor? When this witness arrived at the scene, the jar was already broken.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Oh, that...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
There's no way a name could have been written on a shattered jar. Another person discovered the scene prior to the witness!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I hope you're not implying this "person" was Chief Gant. At the time, he was looking for Darke downstairs. Besides, even if he was there first, why would he break the jar?

Damon Gant arrived at the crime scene prior to the witness. He proceeded to break the jar, and purposefully hid one of the broken pieces. Question: What is this action called?

</p><p>Judge:<br/>
B-but why would Chief Gant do that!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
In light of what happened afterwards, isn't it clear?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What happened afterwards...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Discovering the scene, Lana Skye believed her sister Ema killed the victim. Determined to help her sister, she sought Gant's aid. Lending her his "aid," Gant helped her create evidence that incriminated Darke, sparing Ema. And here is the reason! The reason why Ms. Skye became the Chief's puppet!
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
...!! N-no... I... I did it on my own...
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Please, Sis! Stop trying to protect the Chief! I... I can't watch you suffer any more for my sake...
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
No, you didn't! It wasn't you, Ema! You didn't kill anyone! Don't believe anything Mr. Wright says! <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [Defense attorneys make up the he [sic] most foul lies to defend their clients!] in the original release">Defense attorneys make up the most foul lies to defend their clients!</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [Defense attorneys make up the he [sic] most foul lies to defend their clients!] in the original release)</span>

</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... I guess you do seem the type who likes to twist the truth.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Wait a minute... What if... we're still smack dab in the middle of Gant's trap!?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Is something wrong, Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Lana... may be right after all.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
! What do you mean, Wright?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
So you do tell foul lies then, Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Ms. Skye! Please testify once more!
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
But...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
If evidence was "fabricated" behind your back... then Ema's accidental killing of Prosecutor Marshall... might also be a lie!
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
B-but, I do remember knocking over Mr. Marshall...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Ms. Skye! If you will!
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
... I... I can't...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
This cross-examination may not change a thing. However, there is a possibility that it will, if you tell the truth!
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
... Very well. I'll testify... about what I really saw.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
All right. The witness may testify once more, for the final time!

<p>Lana:<br/>
When I arrived, I found Mr. Marshall's body impaled on that suit of armor's sword.<br/>
Ema and Darke were lying unconscious on the floor nearby.<br/>
When I saw what had happened, I thought she... did it.<br/>
That's why I erased all the evidence that linked her to the murder.<br/>
I had Chief Gant help me remove the body from the sword and carry it...<br/>
But if it all really was a fabrication, Ema might be innocent!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Unbelievable! The body was impaled on the armor's sword?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
You were the only one who saw that. If only you had proof...
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
... Actually, I do have proof.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
!
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
I gave it to Mr. Wright just this morning.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What? To me!?
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
It's a picture I took of the crime scene as I encountered it. I thought it might be needed.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But I don't remember receiving a picture like that...
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Lana must have known... See. Mr. Wright? She really does have faith in you!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well, Mr. Wright. Please present this "picture"!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I don't remember receiving any pictures from Lana...)</span>
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Lana said she gave it to you this morning, right?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I seem to remember getting something from her then...
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Let's check that evidence again! There must be a picture in there somewhere!

I told her to arrange all the evidence. I had her plant the knife tip in the victim's body, and move the body across the room.

Yes... His shirt is showing underneath. It's hard to make out with all the blood on his vest, though.

Exactly my point. His chest is soaked with blood. That's only natural. His lungs no doubt were punctured. Blood poured out of his mouth.

Very well. Let us settle this once and for all. Earlier you refused to present evidence. If you can prove your conduct was not in violation of the law, then do so now!

This is my proof, Your Honor: "Evidence Law."
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
What's this?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I've done my homework too, Chief. Indeed, Ema Skye's fingerprints were on this piece of cloth. However! At that point in time, this was merely a piece of cloth, nothing more.
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
What?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You see, it's written right here in this book: The second rule of evidence law!
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
"Rule 1: No evidence shall be shown without the approval of the Police Department!"
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I found this piece of evidence myself... inside your safe. <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [It goes without saying I did not get approval from the Police Department.] in the original release">It goes without saying I did not have approval from the Police Department.</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [It goes without saying I did not get approval from the Police Department.] in the original release)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
"Rule 2: Unregistered evidence presented must be relevant to the case on trial."
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
And here is the crux of the matter. You see, at the time it was impossible for me to prove the relevance... between the cloth and the SL-9 Incident.

What!? What kind of nonsense is this!? You want "relevancy"? Just take one look at this picture and-

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Sorry, but can you recall... when was that picture presented?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
That was shown only a few moments ago!
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
No...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
He's right. At the beginning of today's trial, that piece of cloth was still meaningless.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The person who gave it value as evidence... was you, Damon Gant.
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
You yourself confessed to a certain "truth."
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
Let me verify this once more. On the day of the crime, you personally cut out this piece of the victim's vest?
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
Oh, yes!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Gant:<br/>
NNNNOOOOO!!!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It was then that you approved this cloth... as conclusive evidence. Yes! You, the Chief of Police, personally approved this cloth!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The only person who could have cut this from the victim's vest... is the one who stood before Prosecutor Marshall in his final moments. In other words, the real murderer! And there's only one person who that could be... Damon Gant, the killer was you!

I knew I should have gotten rid of him... That good-for-nothing scum! For two years he's been snooping around the department trying to get something on me! Crimes are being committed everyday, yet he insisted on hounding me!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Well, your crime wasn't exactly petty.
</p><p>Gant:<br/>
He wanted to reinvestigate the case. He recruited Angel Starr, then convinced Bruce Goodman...

Detective Goodman?

Yeah, that's right.

Goodman turned him down, as he ought to. Still, Jake Marshall didn't know when to quit.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
He stole Goodman's ID card and tried to take the evidence...

Goodman came to me that day. He wanted to file a lost item report.

First, your sister never hurt anyone. Second, Damon Gant betrayed you from the beginning. You see, Ms. Skye... you no longer have any reason to keep silent.

You're right. When this trial is over, I'll tell everything. All that I've done these past two years... from the time I had Gant help me forge evidence, up until today.

So... it seems all the questions raised in this trial have been answered.

In light of this case... It seems a good self-examining is in order for all of us. Ms. Skye.
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
Yes, Your Honor?

You are innocent of murder. However... Although the Chief blackmailed you, the fact is you still acted as his accomplice. A trial will be scheduled for these crimes at a later date.

Yes. I understand, Your Honor.

</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you? Making a detective run all around while on duty, and to top it off you call me here... I've seen happier people at funerals! Hey, lighten up, pals. I'm only kidding!
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Oh... Are you here because of my sister again?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Nope, not this time! I came today because of you, pal!
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Me...?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
That's right. I thought you'd like to see someone.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Lana!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Should you be doing this? She's still under arrest, you know.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
... Well, I won't tell if you won't.
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
Ema... I owe you an apology.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
It's okay, Sis. Don't worry about it.
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
That day, two years ago...
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
...was the first time in my life I ever panicked. It was all I could do to keep myself from screaming. All I could think about was keeping you from getting wrapped up in that mess.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Sis...
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
I asked Gant to help me cover up the "truth." I thought I was doing it for your sake... But now I realize I was wrong.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
...
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
I changed after that day. I had to... It was the only way I could make it through the past two years. I knew how much I was hurting you by distancing myself... but I couldn't bring myself to tell you what I did. I... I was scared. Scared that you'd look at me with those eyes of yours. I was scared of how you'd react if you knew...
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
But Sis! You were only doing it for me...
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
No...
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Huh?
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
I turned my back on you that day. In hiding what I believed to be the truth, I was deceiving you!
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Sis...
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
I'm such a fool... It took me all this time to realize it. Ema... I'm so sorry.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
But Sis! You don't have to apologize! I'm happy now!
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
You're... happy?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Of course! You know, Sis, I always knew that one day you'd come back. And now you have!
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
Oh Ema... Ema!

The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
