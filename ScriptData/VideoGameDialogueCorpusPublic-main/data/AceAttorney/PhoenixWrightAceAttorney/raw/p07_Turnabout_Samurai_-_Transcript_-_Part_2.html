<center><span style="color:green">October 18, 10:00 AM<br/>District Court<br/>Courtroom No. 4</span></center>
<p><br/>
Judge:<br/>
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
<span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release">Very well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Detective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only <span style="color:#E16935">three people</span> here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The "<span style="color:#E16935">Samurai Spear</span>" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)</span>

Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: "What did the security lady at the guard station see?"

Understood.

Let's call this security officer to the stand!

Wendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me "grandma." It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--

Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
I was just getting to the good part, dearie!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Perhaps we can get to the testimony?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Now, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
Yessey I was.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
And to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?

On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.<br/>
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.<br/>
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.<br/>
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.<br/>
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!<br/>
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?<br/>
Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.<br/>
It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!

Well, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.

They were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.

Hmm... So, if no one else went to the studio... Then it would have to be this "Steel Samurai" who did it. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.

Hold on! Look at this photograph one more time. This photo was taken by the camera at the gate for the studios, correct?
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
Yesiree, sonny.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So, whenever anyone passes by here, it automatically takes a picture?
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
And here I thought you didn't know your head from a hole in the ground.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Right... Anyway! It's also true that the computer in the guard station records all security cam data.
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
Ooh! You know, if you wanted to work at the studio, we might have an opening.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That very computer printed out this photo. Note that on the back of the photo are printed the words: [<span style="color:#E16935">Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2</span>]
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
Even I know that means it was taken at 2:00 PM on October the 15th! Really, sonny!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Actually, I knew that too. The issure here is the bit at the end where it says: "<span style="color:#E16935">Photo #2</span>"...
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
"Photo #2"...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The computer only held data for one photo on that day. Don't you think that's odd? Shouldn't this photo be "<span style="color:#E16935">Photo #1</span>" if it really was the ONLY photo!?

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
K-kids!? So, on the photo that you erased...?
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
It was a boy. Probably 2nd or 3rd grade.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
O-order! Order! Let me get this straight. You saw two people pass by the gate on their way to the studios that day? One was <span style="color:#E16935">the Steel Samurai</span>, dragging his leg. The other was a <span style="color:#E16935">boy</span> who looked to be in about 2nd or 3rd grade?
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
Oh yes, well we see his type there every day. Can't stop 'em. Can't catch 'em.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
A boy in 2nd or 3rd grade? Hmm... I assume it would be hard, if not impossible for a young boy to wield the Samurai Spear?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Impossible, I'd think. It's quite heavy.
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
Right! As I said, I didn't pay him much mind. That's why I erased the data.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Um, Nick? What's going on? I mean, the boy was there, that makes him a suspect!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah, and they're already trying to "un-suspect" him.

Mr. WP?
</p><p>Will:<br/>
Y-yes?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Tell me straight: were you really in your dressing room? You didn't go to the studio?
</p><p>Will:<br/>
I-I didn't go to the studio! I was s-sleeping, honest.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
So who was the "Steel Samurai" in that security photo?
</p><p>Will:<br/>
How should I know? The Steel Samurai costume was off in the corner of the dressing room. Anyone could have walked in and taken it, really.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
What!? You should take better care of that stuff!
</p><p>Will:<br/>
I couldn't imagine anyone would want to steal a Steel Samurai costume! So... where does this leave me?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It doesn't look good...
</p><p>Will:<br/>
*sniff*
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You're the only likely suspect, right now.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Nick! W-what are we going to do!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
First, we play for more time. We'll start targeting someone else that could conceivably have done this!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Right! And it'll take them so long to shoot us down that we can get another day!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Right... but if we pick the wrong person, we might lose on the spot.
</p><p>Will:<br/>
You... don't sound very optimistic.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I'm not optimistic at all, actually.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Hey, Nick. It's time.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of "<span style="color:#E16935">guilty</span>" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, your thoughts?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Interesting... Let us hear who you have in mind! However... Be aware that this court does not look kindly on accusing the innocent. If you accuse someone who is obviously innocent, you will be penalized.

The Steel Samurai is dragging his leg in this picture. That means whoever was in the suit knew about that morning's injury. Maybe because... they had been watching the action scene run-through!

Ms. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, <span style="color:#E16935">the scene of the murder</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
W-why would she go through the trouble of wearing the Steel Samurai costume!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Simple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I see! Excellent deductive reasoning, Mr. Wright.

Nick! I guess pressing her was the right thing to do! For an old windbag, she sure likes keeping secrets... Let's get as much information as we can!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
Your Honor. We have learned there were others at Global Studios on the day in question. The director and the producer and, er, some bigwigs, were all present. Yet, as we stand here, they have not been questioned! I hold that it is impossible to declare a verdict on the defendant, Mr. Powers!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... The court acknowledges the defense's point. The prosecution will gather more information about the witness, Ms. Oldbag... and more information about these other people we have just been told of!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
... I understand, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
This ends the day's proceedings in the trial of Mr. Will Powers. That is all. The court is adjourned!

Th-thank you so much, Mr. Wright. I was right to ask you to defend me.

Aww, really, it's nothing. *grin* Oh, or should I... *sniff*
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
We'll be going down to the studios to do some more investigation. We have to find out more about this director and producer. They'll be turning up in the next trial as witnesses for certain. So now's my chance to get material for the cross-examination!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
So, Nick... Have we figured out just who it was in that Steel Samurai costume? Could it really have been old windbag?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What do you think, Mr. Powers?
</p><p>Will:<br/>
I don't think it was her, really.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Neither do I, Nick.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Y-yeah, I know! Look, I was just buying time back there. Someone had to be the bad guy for a bit to take the pressure off Mr. Powers.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Poor old windbag... I feel kinda sorry for her.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well, she wasn't winning any points in there, with or without my accusation. Okay, let's get down to the studios.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Right! We'll be back to visit you soon...

Th-thanks. Thanks, guys. *sniff*
