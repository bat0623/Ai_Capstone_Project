Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>Karma:<br/>
... The prosecution... is ready.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
... U-uh... right, very well. We have reached the final day of our proceedings in this trial. I ask that the prosecution submit decisive evidence.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(C'mon! Don't be awed into silence by every little thing he says!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well, Mr. von Karma, your opening statement.
</p><p>Karma:<br/>
Right. Thanks to Detective Gumshoe's efforts, the boat rental shop caretaker has been arrested. In yesterday's trial, the defense asserted that the caretaker was the murderer. However, the caretaker has yet to confirm this. I would like to ask the defense to cross-examine him as much as necessary.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well! Please bring the witness into the courtroom.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Karma:<br/>
Ladies and gentlemen of the court... I believe you all remember our witness. He lives in the boat rental shop on the lake, from where he witnessed the incident. In addition, he has currently lost memory of his name and identity.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Witness! Why did you run away yesterday?

His name is Yanni Yogi, a former court bailiff!

... Yogi...? That name seems familiar. ... Oh! Yanni Yogi! From the DL-6 Incident!

It's okay. It's actually quite simple. Your Honor! Please take this man's <span style="color:#E16935">fingerprints</span>! Then, we'll compare them to the fingerprints on file for Yanni Yogi 15 years ago...

</p><p>Karma:<br/>
I'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright.

What? What!? No fingerprints!?
</p><p>Uncle:<br/>
Er... you see, before I worked as a caretaker, I worked at a chemical plant. I burned my fingers working with the stuff. Ayup.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh-what!? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Yogi, you sneak! You burned your fingerprints off to hide your past!)</span>

... Yes.  It was me. I did it. ... They put me on the witness stand 15 years ago... Robert Hammond... he said I was mentally unsound. He told me it would make me innocent. Get me off the hook. So...

It was a plan for me to take my <span style="color:#E16935">revenge</span> on the people who ruined my life. I didn't care who had sent it. I thought this was my chance, after 15 years, this was it! Finally, a chance to have my revenge on Robert Hammond and Miles Edgeworth... I have no regrets.

<p>Edgeworth:<br/>
For fifteen years... I have had a recurring dream. A nightmare... it's only a nightmare. That's what I told myself. But now I know, it wasn't a dream. Yanni Yogi wasn't the killer.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You mean... in the incident where your father died?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
From the distance of the shot, it wasn't suicide, either. Everything was as clear as day. The murderer... The criminal in the DL-6 Incident... It was me! Your Honor! I confess my guilt! I am guilty for <span style="color:#E16935">DL-6</span>, the statute of limitations of which ends today! The culprit... is me!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! This is certainly unexpected! The defendant, declared innocent, is confessing to a different crime! A crime for which the statute of limitations runs out today! I'm not really sure how I should deal with this...
</p><p>Karma:<br/>
Bah! It's obvious. We hold a trial. Right here. Right now. We try this man for his crime of fifteen years ago!

Judge! Miles Edgeworth has admitted his own guilt. He has confessed his crime. Let us begin by hearing his testimony. Then, though pointless, let the defense do their cross-examining. The statute of limitations on the DL-6 Incident runs out today. Though it's unconventional for me, I'd like to run this one by the book.

Mr. Edgeworth. Fifteen years ago, you mistakenly killed your father, Gregory Edgeworth. Is this correct?

My father and Mr. Yogi lost their composure, and began to argue.<br/>
Just then, something heavy fell at my feet.<br/>

<p>Judge:<br/>
O-order! Order! Mr. Wright! What are you driving at?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It's simple, Your Honor. At the time of the incident, <span style="color:#E16935">two shots</span> were fired. One went into Gregory Edgeworth's heart. The other hit the elevator door. Remember that the defendant lost consciousness after the shot he fired rang out. In conclusion... We must agree that the second shot was fired by <span style="color:#E16935">someone else</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
M-Mr. Wright! But who could that someone else be!?

</p><p>Karma:<br/>
... I knew I should have stepped in before your wild fantasies got out of hand. Mr. Wright... Look once more at the DL-6 Incident case file. Look closely. Try the "Case Summary" page.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The "Case Summary"... that's on page 1.)</span>
</p><p>Karma:<br/>
Look what is written there! "Not a single clue was found on the scene."
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Karma:<br/>
If the pistol had indeed been fired two times... Then <span style="color:#E16935">the other bullet</span> would have been discovered on the scene!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
He does have a point.
</p><p>Karma:<br/>
That second bullet has never been found! Why? Because <span style="color:#E16935">the second bullet</span> does not exist! The bullet that claimed Gregory Edgeworth's life was the one fired by his own son! That is the truth of this matter. The whole truth. It was undoubtedly something else that made that bullet hole in the door.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! I will have order! ... Mr. Wright has proven one thing to us quite clearly... That the murder weapon was fired twice at the time of the incident. However! As Mr. von Karma says, the second bullet was not found. It is highly unlikely that the police merely overlooked this second bullet. So, all we have is <span style="color:#E16935">the single bullet</span> fired. I'm afraid I have to discount the defense's claim.
</p><p>Karma:<br/>
Tsk tsk tsk... I praise the judge for his wisdom in his matter.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Gah! How did this happen!? I don't believe that the second bullet didn't exist! Was I wrong? Have I been wrong about this whole incident?)</span>

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
... I'm sorry, Maya.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
What?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I... It looks like I was wrong.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Nick...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
If the second bullet wasn't there, then all my conjectures are for nothing!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
N-no... But you said you'd do it, Nick! You said you'd get Edgeworth declared innocent!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
... I'm sorry... It's just, when I saw the photograph, I thought that two shots had been fired. I was so certain of it. I thought I'd won! I thought there was another person, someone else who fired the killing shot. But now... I was wrong to think it could be that simple. This case has stood unsolved for fifteen years!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Nick...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well, it seems that we have finally cleared up this incident. Only one bullet was found at the scene of the crime. That shot was fired by Miles Edgeworth.
</p><p>Karma:<br/>
Precisely.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I would like to ask one thing of Miles Edgeworth before passing my verdict. Have you been paying attention to the trial so far?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Yes, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Do you have any objections?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
No... No, I do not.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
So you killed your father, though that was not your intention?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
... Yes, I did.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>

Very well. The statute of limitations on the murder of Gregory Edgeworth runs out today. Therefore, I must pronounce a verdict on the defendant, right here...

Y-yes, Your Honor! <span style="color:#0070C0">(I have no idea what I'm doing...)</span> U-uh, well, the murderer had no intention of taking the bullet from the scene. But... uh, the murderer HAD to take that bullet.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
"Had to," Mr. Wright? What do you mean?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well, for instance... <span style="color:#0070C0">(For instance WHAT!?)</span> Uh, maybe the bullet, uh... <span style="color:#E16935">hit the murderer</span>?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The bullet... hit the murderer?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
J-just saying, for instance. I mean, if it hit you, you would have to take it with you, wouldn't you? It's not like you could perform surgery right there. Y-y'know?

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Uh, yes... I guess that's how it would work, yes.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
But there's a problem with that! The other two people rescued from that elevator... Miles Edgeworth and Yanni Yogi were both unharmed! So that would mean...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The murderer came <span style="color:#E16935">from outside</span>, yes.
</p><p>The two men fight inside the elevator. Trying to stop them, the boy picks up the pistol at his feet and throws it. The pistol discharges, and the bullet... The bullet goes through the elevator door and hits the murderer outside! The boy loses consciousness... Then the murderer opens the elevator door and sees the men inside...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm. Mr. Wright. You are truly the most unpredictable defense attorney I've ever known. I can tell you're grasping, yet I cannot deny the possibility of what you say.

Crazy?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Remember what Mr. Grossberg said yesterday?
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Grossberg:<br/>
Gregory Edgeworth dealt a blow to his perfect trial record.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Wow.
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
It must have been quite a shock for von Karma. He took a vacation for several months after that, you see. Yes, an unusual event for the man. That was the first, and the last <span style="color:#E16935">vacation</span> he's taken in his many years of prosecuting.
</p>

What if von Karma didn't take that vacation because of shock...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But took it because he was <span style="color:#E16935">injured</span>!

Which would mean...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It could only mean one thing!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
He was the murderer in the DL-6 Incident!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
He was the man who shot Gregory Edgeworth!

It was... von Karma!

So you're claiming that I took a vacation to heal my "<span style="color:#E16935">injury</span>" from the incident? Fascinating! Prove it. I would have needed surgery, no? Where did I go under the knife at, Mr. Wright!? Bring the doctor that operated on me! Have him testify!

Ballistic markings...

You may recall the term. It came up in the first trial, two days ago.

Ballistic markings are <span style="color:#E16935">the fingerprints of a weapon</span>. All bullets fired from a gun are marked with that weapon's unique pattern. By examining the markings, you can tell which weapon fired the bullet. It's quite accurate.
</p>

<p>Phoenix:<br/>
We have two bullets in our possession. One, the bullet removed from Gregory Edgeworth's heart. The other, Mr. von Karma, is the bullet buried in your shoulder. We could analyze both bullets...

<hr/>
<p>It was a shock like none I had ever known. Me? Penalized!? It took hours for me to regain my composure. Suddenly, I found myself in the darkness... I was in the court records room. I must have wandered in there without thinking where I was going. The room was pitch black. The lights must have gone out. I went out in the hall and felt my way to the elevator. <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [I pressed the button, and nothing happened.] in the original release">I pressed the button, but nothing happened.</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [I pressed the button, and nothing happened.] in the original release)</span> Then... there was a noise! I was in pain! A horrible, burning pain in my shoulder! Just then, the lights came back on. The elevator door opened before my eyes. I saw three people inside, all lying unconscious from oxygen deprivation. Much to my surprise, a pistol lay at my feet. I knew then... it was destiny. In his last moments, Gregory Edgeworth was still unconscious. He died, never knowing who had shot him. Later, he spoke through a medium, blaming Mr. Yogi. He was fooled! It was the perfect crime!
</p><p>Karma:<br/>
Tsk tsk tsk... Who would have thought another man would have come to open that elevator door? Judge!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Wh-what?
</p><p>Karma:<br/>
What are you doing!? Do your job! Bring an end to this miserable charade! Now! End it!

That envelope that Larry gave me. It's got money in it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well, yeah. That's not that strange. People give money away to celebrate sometimes.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It's $38.00, Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh. What a weird amount. I mean, it's not a little, but it's not a lot either. ... $38.00 exactly?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
N-N-Nick! Wasn't that exactly the amount of lunch money that was stolen from Mr. Edgeworth in school!?

$38...! No... No!!! Larry, it was you!!!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
What are you so surprised about, Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Larry was absent that day from school, right? But that doesn't automatically rule him out as a suspect.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Think back to that day, fifteen years ago. Larry took the day off, but he was bored, he came in to school anyway. Then he saw the money lying there... and the rest is history.
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
I never was good at History! Heh...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
... Edgeworth... you didn't know, did you?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I suspected. I just couldn't picture Larry protecting you like he did that day. Everyone else was saying you did it. The whole class was against you, remember?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah... too well.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Wright, you may not know this, but we used to have a saying back in school. "When something smells, it's usually the Butz."
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I know, I know.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Really, Wright. I'm surprised you didn't figure it out!

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I'd say so, yes.
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
There you have it!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Grr... Where does that leave me!? I became a defense attorney because of what you two did!

D-death! The death sentence for both of you! Man, if only I had known, I'd have become a prosecutor!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The same goes for me, only the other way around... For the longest time, I thought that I might have killed my own father. I thought I might be a criminal. I became a prosecutor in part to punish myself. If I had known the truth, I might have become a defense attorney after all.

Good morning, Nick. You were really impressive yesterday. Seeing you... It made me think about what I'm doing here. I'm a spirit medium... in training, of course. I wanted to help Mr. Edgeworth too. I wanted to help you. But I couldn't. I was useless. So, I've decided to go back to my training. I'll become a full-fledged spirit medium, for starters. I couldn't say it to your face, so I left this letter. Goodbye, Nick.

Wright? Who's that? You wanna talk? Let's talk Pink Princess! Alright! But... you know. I snuck into the studio the other day. And I saw her... the one inside the Pink Princess suit! Ugh! What a dog! It was kind of a shock for a boy of my tender age.

Yeah, I remember Wright! That lawyer guy! Huh, me? I'm in training to become a paranormal photographer! You know that picture I took of everyone? Well, just behind them there's a ghost! For real! Now that's talent! I'm gonna be famous!

Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.

This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...

The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
