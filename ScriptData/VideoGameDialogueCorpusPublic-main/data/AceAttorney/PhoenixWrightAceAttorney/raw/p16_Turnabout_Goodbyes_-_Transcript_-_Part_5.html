Our school was really small. Every month, kids would bring in an envelope with money for lunch from home.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Huh, I see.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Anyway, this kid's envelope disappeared. With <span style="color:#E16935">$38.00</span> still inside.
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
Oh... Yeah, now that you mention it, I do remember that!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I can see why you'd forget, though. You were out of school that day. Anyway, the envelope had been stolen during PE class. I was coming down with a cold, so I'd skipped PE that day. I was the only one not in class.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
So... they thought you did it?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah. The kids in class said I should be put on trial.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Trial...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So the next day we held a classroom trial, with me as the defendant.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
"I... I didn't do it!"
</p><p>"Guilty!" "He did it!" "Guilty!" "It was you! "Thief!" "Give me my money back!" "You're such a meanie!" "No one play with him!" "Just admit you did it!" "You can't hide the truth!" "Tell us the truth!" "We're not gonna play with you anymore!" "Yeah, and no borrowing my eraser!" "He shouldn't be allowed in the relay race!" "Or on the library committee!" "Give me back the 50 cents I loaned you!" "Hey, did you rob that bank the other day?"
</p><p>Teacher:<br/>
"Now, Phoenix, you know you shouldn't steal people's money! It's not right."

"No..."

Then, a few months later, he suddenly transferred to another school.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
The DL-6 Incident...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Right. I'm not sure, but the transfer probably had to do with his father's death.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
That's so sad!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
... It was several years later when I heard Edgeworth's name again. There was an article about him in the newspaper. The headline was something like "Dark Suspicions of a Demon Attorney." Fabricating evidence, manipulating testimonies, covering up facts... The article said he'd do anything to get a guilty verdict. Anything.
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
But why? What happened!? I mean, that's not the Edgey I used to know at all!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That's what I thought too. I tried to get in touch with him I don't know how many times... He never replied.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
I guess he didn't want to see his old friends...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I couldn't just drop it, though. <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [I wanted to meet him, to know why he had become who he became.] in the original release">I wanted to meet him, to learn why he had become who he became.</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [I wanted to meet him, to know why he had become who he became.] in the original release)</span> That's when I decided.

...! Wait... You don't mean...? That's why!? That's why you became a defense attorney!? <span style="color:#E16935">To meet Edgeworth</span>!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
If I was a defense attorney, I knew he'd have to meet me whether he wanted to or not. In court. ... Edgeworth believed in me, and I believe in him. He's in pain... And no one's on his side. I'm the only one who knows the real Edgeworth. I'm the only one who can help him.
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
Whoa... Nick. S-so, is that why you helped me out for free?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Uh... yes. I helped you because I believed in you. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Except I don't remember saying I'd do it for free...)</span>

First, there's that rental boat shop caretaker. We need to find out who or what he is!

Hey, Edgeworth. Why did you become a prosecutor, anyway? You used to look up to your dad... You said you wanted to be a defense attorney, right?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
... I couldn't let myself deny reality like you.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What do you mean?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
My father was taken from me, and you want me to defend criminals? I'm sorry, Wright, but I'm not that good of a person!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
One suspect was apprehended in your father's murder, right?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Yes. The man trapped in the elevator with my father. His name... was Yanni Yogi. He had to be the shooter, any way you look at it! Yet... he was found innocent. That defense attorney got him off the hook!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That would be Robert Hammond...)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
On that day, 15 years ago... The three of us were trapped in that elevator for five hours. When we were rescued, we all suffered oxygen deprivation. I had lost all memory of the murder.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Lost your memory?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Even now, I can't recall what happened in that elevator. That was the crux of Yogi's argument in court. He claimed Yanni Yogi had been "not of sound mind" due to the oxygen deprivation. Yogi was released due to a lack of evidence... innocent. That's when I changed my mind. I started to hate defense attorneys.

What's your relationship with von Karma?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
He's my teacher, and a man who deserves respect. I learned everything I know of courtroom techniques from him.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
So, he's like my sister was to you, Nick.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
He is a <span style="color:#E16935">perfectionist</span> in all things. In court... In his personal life... He is obsessed with doing everything perfectly.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Perfectly, huh?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
In all the cases he has taken on, none were left unsolved. And not one suspect was declared innocent. Ever.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
But... but that's...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I know. It's possible some of the suspects were indeed innocent. However, it is impossible for us to accurately determine that in every case. All von Karma does is his job, to find the suspect guilty, perfectly. In any case... It's nigh well impossible to find a weakness in him. Should a weakness appear, he would do everything in his power to make it go away.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Um, Edgeworth? If what you're saying is true, you're headed for a guilty sentence tomorrow!

Yanni Yogi was a court bailiff at the time. We just happened to be in that elevator together 15 years ago. The quake was incredibly strong... Before I knew it, everything was dark. We were there for so long, it felt like forever. The air thinned... and the darkness closed in on us in that little box. We became... unsettled.

<p>Edgeworth:<br/>
That's all I remember... When I came to, I was in a hospital bed, staring up at the ceiling. In court, Yanni Yogi's mental condition was called into question. They claimed the oxygen deprivation and stress had caused temporary insanity. In the end, the claim passed the court, and Yogi was found innocent.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Huh... But, isn't that strange? This letter tells him to "get <span style="color:#E16935">revenge</span> on Edgeworth"... Why would he want to take <span style="color:#E16935">revenge</span> on you?

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
If you think about it that way, this letter makes sense. "<span style="color:#E16935">Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth.</span>" Think about it. Yogi was really <span style="color:#E16935">innocent</span>. That's why he wanted <span style="color:#E16935">revenge</span> against me!

M-Mr. Grossberg!
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
Ah, hello there. What's wrong? You look troubled.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
No kidding! I can't believe you're not!
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
M-my my my... Just calm down and tell me what's happened, hmm?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
It's M-Mr. Edgeworth! He... He... *sob*
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Grossberg:<br/>
I see... So, Edgeworth dreamt he shot his own father?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
It's o-only a dream! Only a dream!
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
... I wonder...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
W-what...?
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
If that's the case, then why do you two look so troubled, hmm?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
W-well...
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
Also, consider this. Yogi quite certainly holds a deep grudge against Miles Edgeworth. So deep, he'd want to frame him for murder. This leads me to surmise... That Mr. Edgeworth's dream was NOT a dream. It was real. As you imagined. Miles Edgeworth threw the pistol to save his father... the pistol fired... and the deed was done. ...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
N... No! I don't believe it!
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
Yogi was suspected of murder, and his career as bailiff was irrevocably wrecked. Thus, he sought <span style="color:#E16935">revenge</span> on Miles Edgeworth. This was his last chance, of course, with the statute of limitations so close.

No doubt about it, this is von Karma's handwriting. Yogi was following von Karma's instructions when he killed Hammond.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
But, why kill Robert Hammond?
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
Hammond was a skilled defense attorney. But... he defended clients not for their sake, but for his own.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh? His own sake?
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
He never trusted his clients, that one. The only thing he trusted was his own ability.

But, he got his client found innocent. So why should it matter?
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
Actually, my dear, it's quite different. He won that innocent verdict for no one but himself. Yogi was a free man, but socially, he was ruined.
