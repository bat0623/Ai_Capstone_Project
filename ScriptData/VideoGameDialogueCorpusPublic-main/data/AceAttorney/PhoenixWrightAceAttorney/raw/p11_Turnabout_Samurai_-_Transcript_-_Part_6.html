<p><br/>
Judge:<br/>
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Today will be the final day of this trial. I hope both the prosecution and the defense will be able to present decisive evidence. Very well, Mr. Edgeworth. Your opening statement.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
In yesterday's session, the defense presented us with a new theory for this case. He claims that the scene of the crime was, in fact, Studio Two. Today, I will call on people present in the Studio Two trailer that day. From their testimonies, the truth will become clear.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... very well!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Edgeworth seems a bit on edge today...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The prosecution calls Ms. Dee Vasquez to the stand. Ms. Dee Vasquez is a producer who was present in the Studio Two trailer that day.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Will the witness state her name and occupation?
</p><p>Vasquez:<br/>
... Dee Vasquez. I am a producer for Global Studios.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
On the day of the murder, you were in the trailer in Studio Two...
</p><p>Vasquez:<br/>
As everyone here knows, yes?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...?
</p><p>Vasquez:<br/>
I dislike needless banter. If you must pontificate, do it when I'm not here.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Mrrph!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
V-very well, Ms. Vasquez. Please give the court your testimony concerning the day of the murder.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Nick! I know she did it! Make her pay!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
R-right! <span style="color:#0070C0">(If she's guilty, I'll catch her with her pants down... So to speak.)</span>

<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- The Day of the Murder --</span></center>
<p>Vasquez:<br/>
I entered the trailer, oh, a little before noon.<br/>
The meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00.<br/>
There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One...<br/>
I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me.<br/>
At 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting.<br/>
Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.<br/>
We found Hammer's body later, when we all went to Studio One.<br/>
That's all.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... I have a question about one part of your testimony. You were "fatigued" so you had Sal "take" you...?
</p><p>Vasquez:<br/>
The van.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm?
</p><p>Vasquez:<br/>
There's a van at Studio Two. I had him take me in that. I thought it might be risky to walk, what with that monkey's head toppling over.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Van added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I... I see! Very well. Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.

</p><p>Vasquez:<br/>
The victim was stabbed through the chest from the front, yes? I believe this would indicate that the victim was aware of the killer's presence. Now, the Steel Samurai costume is quite light and mobile. Compared to the victim, I am weaker and slower... I couldn't possibly win such a fight! Not to mention, there is proof I did not have the spear! The photograph of the Steel Samurai shows that the victim himself was holding it! Or do you mean to suggest that I could have wrested it away from him?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Y-yeah! Take that, Wright! If you still think she did it, show us proof!

Hey, Nick. Look at the data we have on that Samurai Spear in the Court Record. Isn't there something in there that gets to you...?

S-sorry, Your Honor. I'd like to take back my previous claim.

Very well, I won't hold you to your claim. But I'm afraid I will have to penalize you.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
This photograph is from five years ago. There was an unfortunate accident at Global Studios. This is a photo of that very accident. Not a word of this was leaked to the outside. It was a close-kept secret at the studios.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
What does this have to do with the current case!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Mr. Edgeworth... You still can't see it? See the fallen man in this photo? <span style="color:#E16935">See how the fencepost pierced him through the chest?</span>

Wh... what!? Are you saying...!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes. What happened five years ago... has happened again!
</p><p>Vasquez:<br/>
!!!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Wright! Continue!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It's 2:30 PM on the day of the murder! Ms. Dee Vasquez meets Jack Hammer outside the Studio Two trailer! Then she did it! She pushed Mr. Hammer off the stairs onto the fence! Just like Mr. Hammer had himself done five years ago! Though whether she did it on purpose or by accident, I cannot say.
</p><p>Vasquez:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I-in other words... th-the victim, Mr. Hammer... He died in the same way that he caused another man to die... five years ago!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Precisely. Ironic, isn't it?
</p><p>Vasquez:<br/>
... Hoh hoh. Very creative, Mr. Wright. I could use a man like you on my script writing staff.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You deny that what I say is true?
</p><p>Vasquez:<br/>
... Mr. Wright. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that Hammer died at the trailer as you say. Yet the body was found at <span style="color:#E16935">Studio One</span>, was it not? And in the Evil Magistrate's costume, no less. Are you then claiming that I carried the body to Studio One... And returned to the trailer all in the space of a <span style="color:#E16935">15 minute break</span>? How could I have disposed of the body!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The break in the meeting at the trailer lasted 15 minutes, from 2:30 to 2:45. Could Jack Hammer have been pushed off the stairs to his death... then carried to Studio One and placed inside his costume? There wasn't enough time!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>

Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator! The body had to be placed in the van, and put into the costume. There's no way Ms. Vasquez could have done that alone! Also, don't forget that they had to dispose of the Steel Samurai costume. They had to... because it was covered in Mr. Hammer's blood! They probably burned it in that small incinerator. Well, Ms. Vasquez! Shall I continue?

You "asked to be left out"?
</p><p>Vasquez:<br/>
Yes. It seems that everyone else was questioned. And I'm really not fond of that sort of thing.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But, you can't decide who the police will and won't question!
</p><p>Vasquez:<br/>
Thankfully, the studio thinks otherwise. They were nice enough to understand that, since we were in a meeting... There was no way we could be involved. Thus, they covered for us.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Covered for you... or covered it up for you? There must have been a lot riding on it, with all those bigwigs at the meeting... I'm sure her "<span style="color:#E16935">professionals</span>" helped convince everyone they didn't require questioning.)</span>

This is my proof!

And... this tells us why Ms. Vasquez wanted to kill Mr. Hammer?
</p><p>Vasquez:<br/>
I'd say all it proves is that the defense attorney has completely lost his marbles.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Urk!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Wright! The court requests that you find your marbles immediately. And, I'm afraid I have to penalize your <i>[sic]</i> for this waste of the court's time.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Nick! We're so close! Think this one through, please!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Wright, I'll ask you again.

She had no motive, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What's that now!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It was Mr. Hammer who was out for blood! All Ms. Vasquez did was push him off the stairs... in self defense!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
What's that now!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It's simple! <span style="color:#E16935">Mr. Hammer</span> was intending to kill Ms. Vasquez!

Wha-!? WHAT!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Your Honor! Jack Hammer drugged Mr. Powers with sleeping pills! Jack Hammer snuck into the dressing room and stole the Steel Samurai costume! Jack Hammer wore the costume to fool the security lady into thinking he was Powers! Then Jack Hammer made his way to the trailer! And for what purpose, you ask? To kill Dee Vasquez, who had so cruelly taken advantage of him all those years!

I see... Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes, Your Honor?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
It appears you have brought about yet another miracle.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I... thank you, Your Honor.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I think not, Your Honor. Will Powers was innocent. That he should be found so is only natural... not a miracle.
