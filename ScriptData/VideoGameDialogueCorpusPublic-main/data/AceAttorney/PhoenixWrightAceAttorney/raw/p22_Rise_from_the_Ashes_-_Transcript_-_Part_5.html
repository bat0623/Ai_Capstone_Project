What do you mean, "what happened" to you?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
It's all there in the file... Joe Darke's last victim was Prosecutor Neil Marshall. When he murdered Officer Marshall's brother, he left behind an incriminating piece of evidence.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But what did you have to do with those killings, Ema?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
On the night Prosecutor Neil Marshall was murdered, Joe Darke... tried to kill me.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What? He tried to kill you!?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Officer Marshall's brother... Neil... was only trying to save me.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So that means you...
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Yes. I was a <span style="color:#E16935">witness</span> in the Joe Darke trial.

It happened two years ago... It was right about this time of the year, too. There was a terrible thunder storm that day... Unusual for the season. I was alone in my sister's office. We were planning to eat dinner together once she finished her work. Then suddenly... This terrifying man came bursting into the office!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Joe Darke...
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
It seemed like he was running from someone. He pulled out a knife and screamed at me. I didn't know what was going on. Just then, Prosecutor Marshall showed up.

Made it up? You mean, provided <span style="color:#E16935">bogus evidence</span>?

The Prosecutor's Office wanted that guilty verdict so badly. Lana forged the evidence, and Mr. Edgeworth used it...

Edgeworth!?

Yes. But I'm sure he didn't know anything about it! He couldn't have known he was being given false evidence. Even so... that's when it all started. The rumors about Mr. Edgeworth, I mean. It's all my fault... If I could have just testified properly, none of this would have happened!

Because the detective offices and the questioning room are right across from the elevator.

It appears so. I was filing some papers while Gant and Marshall were questioning Darke. When I returned to my office, I saw three bodies on the floor and smelled blood.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Three bodies? Prosecutor Marshall, the victim, Ema, who had passed out,
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
and the suspect, Joe Darke. During the struggle, it seems Mr. Marshall stuck a final blow before he died. Joe Darke had incurred a minor concussion, and lay unconscious.

Let me get this straight. You were all involved in the SL-9 Incident?

That's right. Quite a coincidence, hmm?

I don't buy it.

There's no way everyone involved in this trial was also involved in that incident just by "chance."

At least one person went to extremes because they didn't believe it was truly solved.

Officer Marshall... Yes, his actions came as a surprise to me as well. Ever since his brother died, he's changed completely.

I guess he wasn't convinced with the ruling against Joe Darke.

Tomorrow is the last day. It's too late to change prosecutors. I'll bet that's what my superiors are banking on. I never thought that case would come back to haunt me like this.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What do you mean?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
That list of evidence. It seems too short. Most lists... run twice as long.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It's only half as long as most lists? <span style="color:#0070C0">(That is odd...)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
After Neil Marshall was murdered, I became prosecutor for that case. I may not have been part of the investigation, but at the time there was only one thing on my mind: I'd use the evidence I was given to prove the suspect guilty!
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Say, we just saw a picture taken around that time.

Could you tell us again about what happened that day? The day Detective Goodman was murdered? You were participating in a ceremony over at the station, right?

I've never cared for ceremonies, but I had to attend that one.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Because you were awarded this?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Those receiving awards can't exactly skip out on the ceremony. I finished up at the office in the morning, then drove over to the Police Department.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You, "finished up" at the office?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Yes. Just odds and ends- clerical stuff. I didn't plan on returning to the office that day. That is, until I was asked to take something back.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Take something back?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
This.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Oh yeah. Chief Gant asked you to hold onto that, didn't he?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Yes. It was a piece of evidence in a case that was closed half a year ago. He asked me to bring it back to the Prosecutor's Office.

This award originates from an ancient Chinese tale. In Chinese, the word "contradiction" is written with two characters: the first means "halberd," and the second means "shield." Have you heard this story?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Me? Oh, uh... sure. Everyone knows that! Why don't you tell it though... for Ema's sake.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Very well. Long ago in the kingdom of Chu, there was an arms merchant. One day, he presented the king with two items. The first was a halberd he claimed could slice through any shield or armor. The second was a shield he claimed could withstand any weapon.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

When the king pointed this out, the merchant was left speechless. And thus, the Chinese word for "<span style="color:#E16935">contradiction</span>" was born.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Oh, I see! So the "chipped shield" and the "broken knife" symbolize...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Precisely so. They symbolize the merchant's items. The ancient tale ends with the merchant at a loss for words, but it's in our nature to pursue matters to their conclusion... even if it results in something as ugly as this.

Lana transferred to the Prosecutor's Office two years ago, didn't she?
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
Yes, thanks to "Chief" Gant's powerful influence.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Chief...
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
That's right. Having solved the SL-9 case, his position as chief was secured. There was only one thing left for him to control, and then no one could stand in his way: the Prosecutor's Office.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What? You mean... That's why Lana was transferred!?
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
If he could control the Chief Prosecutor, he could control the Prosecutor's Office. That must have been his goal all along.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
B-but how could he control Lana?
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
I don't know, but one thing's for sure. Ever since that case ended, she's never been the same. It's only logical to conclude... there must have been a reason for her change.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(At last... I'm finally getting close to the bottom of this ugly mess.)</span> Thank you, Ms. Starr.

You listen to me, Rookie. It takes more than just ingredients to create fine cuisine. I hope you turn out to be a better chef than I've been...

Me. I had access because I was second in command of that investigation.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes you, but also one other: Damon Gant.
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
... If you intend to accuse Chief Gant, you'll need more than just words. Show me proof that Chief Gant falsified evidence in that case!

I...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The person concealing evidence was none other than Chief Gant himself. Now tell me! Why are you taking all the blame for him!?
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
... Touché, Mr. Wright. It's as you surmised. I cannot disobey the Chief's orders... even if it means being found guilty for murder.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Why not?
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
Come now, Mr. Wright. You can't possibly expect me to be able to tell you that. Three days ago... I had no choice but to cooperate.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

Or perhaps I should say, "follow orders." Yes, that's more accurate than "cooperate."

Correct.

The murder weapon... You mean, Edgeworth's knife?

No. When I found the body, this was the knife stuck in it.

I couldn't just leave that knife in him, so I took it out and stabbed him with another knife.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That would be Edgeworth's knife?
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
That's right. Even though he was already dead, my hands were shaking at the thought of stabbing him. That's why I ended up cutting my hand.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
And that is the reason for the bandage on your right hand?
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
Yes. It seems that I got blood on the victim's shoes as well. And then... she saw me just as I plunged the knife in.

<p>Lana:<br/>
It took a lot of work to finally close the Darke case two years ago. It was over with. I didn't ever want it to be opened again. My intent was to prevent that by whatever means possible.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So... you hid Darke's knife?
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
The weapon used to stab the detective was evidence in the Joe Darke case... If word got out, which it would, the reporters would have a field day with that.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So you wrapped the knife in your scarf, and hid it. In Edgeworth's exhaust pipe...
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
Right. Then I called my sister, to tell her what happened, and to ask her to hide the knife that was inside my muffler.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You asked Ema?
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
I didn't want anyone on the force to know about this.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That would explain why Ema is so confident... about Lana's innocence!)</span>
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
Speaking of phone calls, I had a bad feeling about one of them that day.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
A bad feeling?
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
The truth is, after I received those orders from Chief Gant. The first thing I did was make a phone call. A phone call to Patrolman Jake Marshall.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
To Marshall? Why on earth would you call him?
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
The lead investigator for the SL-9 Incident had been murdered. I wanted that fact to be kept hidden, and I needed help. He was the only other person I could trust. Or at least, I thought I could trust him at the time. However, it seems that after I spoke to him he went off on an escapade of his own...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Oh! You mean...
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
Not wanting the case to die, he decided to take things into his own hands.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He disguised himself as Officer Goodman and tried to steal the evidence!)</span>
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
He had already stolen the ID card... but it seems he still hadn't made up his mind to break into the evidence room. After my phone call, any remaining doubts he had must have disappeared.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So your phone call caused the incident in the evidence room!?
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Lana:<br/>
I'm afraid that's all I can tell you.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But Lana...
</p><p>Lana:<br/>
You've earned my respect, Mr. Wright. Both as a defense attorney and an investigator. Now please... Don't pursue this any further in court tomorrow!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Tomorrow's trial... There's only one way to drive off Lana's demons... I've got to get to the bottom of everything! Detective Goodman's real murderer... and what went down in the Chief's office two years ago...)</span>
