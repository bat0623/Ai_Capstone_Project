Blood is sticky stuff, you know. You can't just wash it away with a little water. Even if you can't see it, it's still there...

Two years ago... it was the biggest case I'd ever handled. The police and the prosecutors were desperate for decisive evidence.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
So... they didn't solve it?
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
On the contrary. It was solved quite cleanly. The criminal was caught and executed.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(E-executed...?)</span>
</p><p>Angel:<br/>
Yes, the criminal got what was coming to him.

Myself, and one other person you know well.

Officer Marshall, you're in charge of security for the evidence room, right?
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
You got good eyes, pardner. It's an easy job, and I'm grateful for it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Actually, Officer Meekins at the detention center told us.
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
Ah, that poor little dogie? Poor guy, I keep getting his name wrong and calling him "Meekly."
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
He told us something. He said that, when the stabbing occurred... you weren't at your station.
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
... Well, maybe I shouldn't be telling you this... But since I got demoted from detective two years ago... Well, it might not look it, but I lost my fire for the job, you know?
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
So... what were you doing around 5:15 when the murder took place?
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
Well... I reckon I was galloping down the highway on the back of my steed, Zippy.
</p><p>Ema:<br/>
Note: he was riding down the highway on his horse named "Zippy."
</p><p>Marshall:<br/>
There's no need for people here, anyhow. These newfangled machines do a bang-up job of keeping an eye on the place.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You mean <span style="color:#E16935">the security camera system</span>?

I don't take to machines much. Kinda like that stewed broccoli they sneak in next to your steak, you know?

We keep only evidence from solved cases in this room. They're kept here under the presiding detective's supervision for two years. So we can re-investigate them if it turns out there was a mistake, see?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So, what happens to the evidence after two years?

It goes to sleep forever in the underground vault at the Police Station. That's what we call "transferal." We do it every February.

"Transferal" is like a funeral for old cases. Two years after a case is solved... it's closed forever. Dead. Never to be reopened again. Never to be reinvestigated.

The aluminum powder adheres completely to the print. Once the powder is well spread... just blow away the excess.

I could make a pretty good guess. The bloody handprint and the fingerprints are in different places right? That means that the prints probably don't have anything to do with our case. So, whose fingerprints would we most likely find on this evidence locker?
