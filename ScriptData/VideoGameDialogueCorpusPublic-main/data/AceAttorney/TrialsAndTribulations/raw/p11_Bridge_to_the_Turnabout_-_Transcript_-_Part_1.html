<p><br/>
"Shichishito". The treasured Kurain Village heirloom whose name means "7 Branched Sword". It is said that this sacred sword represents life itself. Though the branches may appear to be infinite, the choices limitless... ...like our destinies, the sword comes to but one end. One merciless point. And when the silver cord, the fragile thread that binds us to this world, is severed... ...the illusion is revealed and the implacability of fate is finally laid bare...

Maya:<br/>
Hey, Nick.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah? What is it?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
You know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Um, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
But just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Um... I guess so, yeah.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Glad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Pearls...?)</span>
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
So! That's why we need to go on a special "Spiritual Hot Spot Tour", Mr. Nick!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
It's the New Year's issue of "Oh! Cult!", Winter Spiritual Locations Special!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...Oh. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Pearls looks so happy.)</span>
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
It's at a spiritual retreat called "Hazakura Temple". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Now I definitely don't want to go...)</span>
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
You know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Reservations...? For a temple? Are you serious?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Don't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Yeah! And I signed up for the "Special Course"!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Th-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Alrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff!
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Yes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Well, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Hey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this "Hazakura Temple"?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
No, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Whaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Come on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Nope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Wh-What is it, Mr. Nick?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Let me see that magazine! Th-This nun...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Is she a friend of yours or something, Nick?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Th-This girl... I-It's...!)</span>
</p>

<p>Dahlia:<br/>
My name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Dahlia:<br/>
Honestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
But... It can't be! <span style="color:#0070C0">(She was found guilty and should still be in prison...)</span>
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
...Mr. Nick?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
... I'll go.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Huh...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Hazakura Temple... I said I'll go.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Yay! Isn't that great, Pearly!?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Yes! Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Nick! You'd do anything for Mystic Maya, right? Even walk over burning coals, right!?

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Maybe you should put on something warmer for a change!

W-W-Well, it's supposed to be c-c-cold... It's t-t-training. ...Ah-Achoo!

P-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo!

Well, well, well... How nice to see you here. Welcome to our temple!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Oh...! Th-Th-Thank you... Ah-Achoo!
</p><p>???:<br/>
Oh my, my, my... Thank you for coming all this way. Come now, come now. You must have been cold.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What's with the past tense...? We're freezing into human popsicles as we spea--!
</p><p>???:<br/>
Ho ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Th-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass--
</p><p>???:<br/>
Oh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself.
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
I'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
B-B-B-Bikini...!?
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
That's riiight! Actually, that's my "temple" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, "Why not choose a bikini?" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
It certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your "Special Course"!
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
Well, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho!
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
R-Reckless...?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
"Wa ha ha"...?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Maybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
But you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m--
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
Yes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around?

</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Forgive him, Sister, for he knows not what he is saying.
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
Well, well, well. Just call me Bikini and forget that "Sister" part. A channeling dojo is basically a spiritual power training ground. We have special holy items prepared here to help people boost their spiritual power.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
H-Holy items...?
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
If you train an entire evening surrounded by these items... Aaah. It's quite mysterious. The spiritual power of these items seems to envelop you. Wa ha ha ha.

Um, so what exactly is the "Special Course"...?

You must be incredibly devoted to be interested in that at such a young age! It's a training session where you sit on a block of spirit ice and chant a spell... ...30,000 times! All while being showered in freezing cold spirit water.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Eh...?
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
It's February now, right? You have to be careful this time of the year... If you don't watch it, you'll catch pneumonia or maybe even die of hypothermia... So be careful, you hear? Wa ha ha. Ho ho ho. Ha!

Oh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Can't argue there. That's probably why it's called, "Dusty Bridge".
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Read it again, Maya. It says, "<span style="color:#E16935">Dusky Bridge</span>".
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Well, it's practically the same thing.

...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest.

Spiritual power...? Did you go to that temple for that reason as well?

Spiritual power...?

Yes. Spiritual training has been a cause behind many great tragedies. This incident was just another example...

Hmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me.

So this is the bridge that Wright fell through?

Yup! I can't imagine being that reckless myself... "Look before you cross," is how it goes, right? Or was that "leap"...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
And? Is there something on the other side?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yeah, some old building they call the Inner Temple... But we can't get over there without a bridge, sir.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
What...?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Nobody lives there, so it's usually not a problem... But someone was at the Inner Temple doing some training and now they're stuck there.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Yes, I heard that from Wright. It's Maya Fey.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Oh no... Her again...? Anyway, the air's really turbulent right now so we can't do an aerial extraction. No one's gonna be able to reach the Inner Temple until tomorrow, sir.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Will she be alright in this cold...?)</span> So how did this bridge burn down anyway?

Phoenix Wright, of course! For some reason, Godot has really got it in for Mr. Wright!

Yeah, he seems to have some kind of a grudge.

It's really weird. All of a sudden, no one can reach him! Hmm, I wonder if the rumors are true. Maybe since Mr. Wright caught a cold and won't be defending, he just lost interest.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I intend to appear in court in the role of defense lawyer. However... I would be quite unhappy if it came out that I'm actually a prosecutor.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yeah, I can see why. But I'm not the one you have to worry about... I think the real problem is gonna be that judge...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...Yes, he certainly would remember my face, even after such a long absence. That's why I requested another judge preside over the case. We've only met each other once. There's a good chance he won't remember me at all.

Y-Yeah, but... what about the prosecutor? Everyone in the prosecutor's office must know you! Wouldn't it be a problem if someone there made a big stink, sir?

There's no need to worry. I pulled a few strings and arranged for a prosecutor of my own choosing.

The smallest flame can sometimes bathe a case in a whole new light... In my years in court, I've seen it happen over and over again. That's why I'm committed to searching until I have those answers. Now then, is it really true that you didn't go to the Inner Temple last night...?
