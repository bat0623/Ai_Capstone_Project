Hey, Nick! Get a load of this! Hey, are you listening to me!? You can clean the toilet later! This is important!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
*sigh* What are you freaking out about now?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Hey hee. Today will be the last time you talk to me that way!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
We're about to hit the <span style="color:#E16935">big time</span>!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
"Big time"? And what do you mean by "we"? You don't mean you and me are...?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Ha! Don't be silly. I'm talking about me and Pearly, of course!
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Hello. It's a pleasure to see you again, Mr. Nick!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Pearls! You haven't changed a bit! Wait... What are you doing here anyway?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Hee hee. Haven't you heard, Mr. Nick? Here! Take a look at this!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What's this...? Some kind of poster?)</span> <span style="color:#E16935">Kurain Village</span>... Isn't that...?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
That's right. It's our hometown... Pearly and mine, that is.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What's this about "<span style="color:#E16935">treasures</span>" from the boonies?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Ha ha ha. Very funny. You can laugh all you want... But you'll be singing another tune tonight!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Tonight? What about tonight?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
The "Treasures of Kurain" exhibit doesn't actually start until next week, but... ...the promoter sent us some special VIP entry passes!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
That's why I dressed up extra special today! What do you think, Nick?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Heh. Same Maya. Different day.)</span> This young lady here is Maya Fey... The younger sister of Mia Fey... ...My friend and mentor. I first met her two years ago... I was working on the case surrounding Mia's death, and ever since then...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
I've been the one who's been keeping this law office afloat from behind the scenes.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Actually that's just a cover for her true identity... In reality, she's a spirit medium, and a bit of a shady character.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Hey! Who are you calling "shady"!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
And this little girl is Pearl Fey, but I usually call her "Pearls". She's Maya's cousin and a spirit medium in training herself.
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
I know I'm a bit young, but I want to help in any way I can, Mr. Nick!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Kurain Village is the home of the mysterious <span style="color:#E16935">Kurain Channelling Technique</span>. And Maya here is the <span style="color:#E16935">daughter</span> of the Kurain School of Channeling's <span style="color:#E16935">Master</span>. ...I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's no joke. I've seen her power with my own eyes... It's the real thing alright.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Earth to Nick! How long are you going to make two gorgeous women like us wait!?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Yes, Mr. Nick! I can't wait any longer! I want to see the exhibit!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Woohoo! Did you hear that, Pearly!? The finest museums!
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Yes, I did! That's really wonderful.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So this basement warehouse is pretty well-protected, huh?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
...Of course it is. After all, there are some priceless treasures here. The security guards are very highly trained as well...

It's YOU!! And I'm the one who should be saying "not again"! Why is it that every time something bad happens, you always show up, pal?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/> 
I should be asking you that. Aren't there any other detectives?

No, I should be asking YOU that. What are you doing hanging around here?

</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
We got an emergency phone call from a guard at the scene of crime, pal. He said, "The urn was just stolen!"

The scene of the crime... You mean here, right?

Wrong. That urn was being kept under careful guard in the <span style="color:#E16935">basement warehouse</span>.

Sometimes he appears as a museum guard! Sometimes he appears as a big brown bear known to surprise unsuspecting victims. But underneath those disguises is... the true Mask☆DeMasque!

Umm... So are you really as famous as you say?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Of course! For a lawyer, you have a rather shocking lack of knowledge about the world. I had no idea anyone was left in this city that had not heard of me! Look at me! I am Mask☆DeMasque's arch-enemy, the Ace Detective Luke Atmey! At this moment, there are two mighty figures which loom large over this grand city! One embodies the nefarious forces of darkness. The other the angelic cherubs of light!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
...Boy, now I'm really lost. What is he saying, Nick?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
I have been personally on the heels of this villain since his first crime. After learning this criminal's patterns, I thwarted his very latest loathsome larceny! I even returned the target of his tyranny, the "Portrait of Mejeena" to the crime scene! And I did it all by myself! I took it back from Mask☆DeMasque... With my brawny mind and my brilliant muscles!

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I see... ...Huh!? Hang on a second! You were here last night? Here? In Lordly Tailor!?

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Flattery will get you nowhere, Pinocchio...)</span>
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
I first received the request for my services 20 days ago. And it was 10 days ago that we received Mask☆DeMasque's calling card...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Huh? You were hired BEFORE the calling card even arrived?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Yes. You see, the person who hired me is quite rigorous and thorough.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's Adrian for you...)</span>
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
A mere 10 days after hiring me, her worst premonitions were realized!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
A calling card arrived, right?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Yes! So, Ace Detective that I am, I set a trap for the thief right in the warehouse. And waited for him... alone.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Alone? ...But why? Why didn't you go to the police for help?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Ridiculous! Why would I seek help from such a singularly useless group of nincompoops?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(You've got a lot of nerve. After all, it was you that let DeMasque get away.)</span>
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
I always operate alone and concealed. Out of the sight of others.
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
...? "Corn Sealed"...?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Precisely! Even the guards on duty here were unaware of my presence. "To fool your enemies, first you must fool your friends." It's my own original proverb!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Anyway, back to what happened last night...
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
As I was saying, I hid here in the warehouse and waited for the thief to arrive. But I swear to you... Not a solitary soul came through that entrance! Nevertheless... The Sacred Urn <span style="color:#E16935">disappeared</span>!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
B-But that's impossible! How could it just disappear!?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
"How?" you ask? Don't be ridiculous, Sir Lawyer. If I knew the answer to that question, I wouldn't be here!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(For someone who seriously messed up his own stakeout, he's rather full of himself.)</span>
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
So you're saying that even though on <i>[sic]</i> one came through those doors last night... ...our precious urn still somehow <span style="color:#E16935">vanished</span> from under your nose?

Yes, money... Ronnie is incredibly rich... And super generous. He bought me a bike that's so fast it would make your head spin. And shopping? I like to shop so much it makes Ron's head spin. The other day, it actually happened. His head actually started to spin.

Umm... What's going to happen at the trial tomorrow that's so dramatic?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Do you know what your biggest mistake so far has been, Sir Lawyer? ...It was becoming a lawyer in the first place.
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
...That certainly does sound like a big mistake, Mr. Nick.
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Tomorrow will be a day to remember. I, Luke Atmey, will take the stand! And then... Zvarri! My testimony will prove to be the undoing of the lot of you! Yes! All of you! I will unmask you as the thief's co-conspirators!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
C-C-Conspirators!?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Hee hee hee hee hee... You're quick on the defensive, I see! However! It is not I that is your greatest enemy! There is a far more dangerous threat that you will face during the trial.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Wh-What are you talking about...?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Sir Lawyer... If you truly are who you say, I'm sure you've heard of him. ...His name is "<span style="color:#E16935">Godot</span>".
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
G-Godot...?

Um... Who is this "Godot" person...?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
...It's not surprising that a spirit medium has not heard the name. Godot. The prosecutor whose equal cannot be found in this country, but in heaven. Godot. A legend or myth... Men pin a lifetime of hopes on the chance to simply meet him.

But the best prosecutor in the country isn't Godot, it's Mr. Edgeworth! Isn't that right, Nick!?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
...It's no surprise that a spirit medium such as yourself would know nothing of this. But Ace Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth is currently traveling abroad.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Huh...?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
In fact, it was Mr. Edgeworth who acknowledged Godot as the best in this country.
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
And you agree with that?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Most certainly. In fact, you could call him the Luke Atmey of the Prosecutor's Office.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Well, that's good to hear! The prosecution has a fighting chance tomorrow!
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Mr. Nick, is this "Godot" really that strong?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Hmm... I seem to remember hearing about something like that...
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Not surprising... Some people spend their entire lives idly waiting for his appearance.
