Byrde:<br/>
Gooood morning, Mr. Wright!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Good morning, Maggey!
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
So, what do you think is going to happen today, sir? Yesterday's session didn't go so well, and then ended on a giant mystery.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's true... And we still haven't solved a single part of it yet...)</span>
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Are you OK, Nick?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh? Oh, uh... Yeah. Of course.
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
I saw that! That little flash of doubt in your eyes!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
N-No! That wasn't doubt. That was, umm... determination!
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
Why don't I believe you...?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
It's nearly time, Maggey. You'd better get going to the defendant's seat.
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
Roger. Don't let me down, Mr. Wright. I'm counting on you!
</p><p>Hey, pal!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Hey, Detective Gumshoe...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Quit stressing Maggey out! She doesn't need that!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
H-How did you know she was stressed...?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
I was watching through the doorway.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Oh...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
You look like you lost the case already. Show a bit of confidence, will you, pal!? Here, maybe this'll help.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Huh!? Have you taken up aromatherapy, too?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Not in a million years, pal! Don't tell me that you don't remember this thing?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hmm... Come to think of it, that doesn't look like one of those aromatherapy bottles...)</span>
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
This is the small bottle that turned up in <span style="color:#E16935">Trés Bien's kitchen</span> a couple of days ago.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Maya:<br/>
Wow! Look at all these little bottles!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Hey, wait a minute... There's one bottle that's different from all the others.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
And... *sniff* It doesn't smell.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Gumshoe:<br/>
We finally got the analysis results back from the lab.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
So!? What is it? Is it the poison?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
I'm afraid not, pal. It's... medication.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Medication?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yeah. For ears. Topical use only, apparently.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
For ears? You mean...?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yeah. It's the medication Glen Elg was using for his ruptured eardrum!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What was Glen Elg's ear medicine doing in the kitchen...?)</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Small Bottle refiled into the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Um, what about the <span style="color:#E16935">unidentified fingerprints</span>? Anything on that?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Someone screwed up, so they only had time to analyze the contents of the bottle. Another hour and they might have gotten something on the prints, but...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hmm... That's going to weaken its impact as a piece of evidence...)</span>
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>

<center><span style="color:green">January 8, 10:00 AM<br/>District Court<br/>Courtroom No. 4</span></center>
<p><br/>
Judge:<br/>
Court is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ready and waiting as always, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very good. Then we'll get underway at once. Yesterday we heard the testimony of Mr. Victor Kudo. He claims to have witnessed the defendant putting a powder into the victim's coffee. However, the witness's testimony was plagued with a number of <span style="color:#E16935">problems</span>.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
The mark on the rim of the cup shows that the victim drank from it <span style="color:#E16935">with his right hand</span>. But according to the old man's testimony, he picked it up <span style="color:#E16935">with his left hand</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Thank you, Mr. Godot. Furthermore, according to the witness's account... ...the victim was listening to the radio with an earpiece in his left ear. Yet, the <span style="color:#E16935">victim's left eardrum was ruptured</span>, which made him effectively deaf in that ear.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
It's amazing how many contradictions a single case can have, huh Nick?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! Allow me to enlighten you, Your Honor. The world, you see, keeps turning, and we must turn with it.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
... You've lost me already, Mr. Godot.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Don't let the mysteries of yesterday mystify you today. Only losers think like that. You've got to change with the times! That's one of my rules!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Are you implying that you've resolved these contradictions? You know the <span style="color:#E16935">answers</span> to these riddles!?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
The old guy wasn't just throwing seed in here. He was throwing us off the scent. And today I'll prove it.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well. Let the first witness take the stand!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Godot:<br/>
And you are?
</p><p>Armstrong:<br/>
Oh bonjour, everyone! I am Jean Armstrong. z'e owner and 'ead chef of la Trés Bien restaurant. Enchanté!
</p>
<center>.........</center>
<p><br/>
Judge:<br/>
Forgive me for asking, witness, but... are you a woman?
</p><p>Armstrong:<br/>
Oh là là, monsieur! As you can see, I am la pert and perky gentleman, non?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Er... Umm...
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
On the day of the incident, you were in Trés Bien's kitchen. Isn't that right?
</p><p>Armstrong:<br/>
W'iz you monsieur...
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
...?
</p><p>Armstrong:<br/>
...everything feels right!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Wow, he's totally unfazed! Doesn't anything intimidate this guy...?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well. Your testimony please, witness. Please tell the court what happened that day at Trés Bien.

Oui! Volontiers!

And suddenly, the mystery disappears! Like I said, the world keeps turning, so roll with it!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... That would explain the coffee cup and the earpiece conundrum... The mirror would have made everything appear back to front.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What the heck!? It's way too early in the morning for this to be happening to me!)</span>

No question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!

<p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's kinda hard to believe everything's the fault of a <span style="color:#E16935">mirror</span>, but...)</span>
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Do you think Old Seedy saw everything through a reflection...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
If he did, it would explain all the contradictions in his testimony.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
But that just makes the situation worse for Maggey! There's gotta be something in that old man's testimony! We've just gotta dig deeper!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
The coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD... Let's think back over Mr. Kudo's testimony for a second, shall we?
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Kudo:<br/>
The boy was wearing the earpiece <span style="color:#E16935">on the same side as</span> the green lens of <span style="color:#E16935">his specs</span>.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Kudo:<br/>
No question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his <span style="color:#E16935">left ear</span>, without a doubt!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
So, to summarize... ...we were told both the HMD and the earpiece were on the victim's <span style="color:#E16935">left side</span>. Now, if Mr. Kudo saw all that as a reflection in a mirror... ...it means both the HMD and the earpiece were actually on the victim's <span style="color:#E16935">right side</span>.
</p><p>Armstrong:<br/>
Exactement! You see, monsieur. Now z'at you think about it, it is not so 'ard, non?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Unfortunately, that's where we run into a monumental contradiction with the facts! If Mr. Kudo really did see everything in a mirror... ...why is it that the HMD is now on the wrong side of his head!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! ...Mr. Wright is correct! If the witness genuinely observed the victim reflected in a mirror... ...then we would expect the victim's eyepiece to have been over his <span style="color:#E16935">right eye</span>.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
<span class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:File"><a class="mw-file-description image" href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445"><img class="mw-file-element lazyload" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" decoding="async" height="192" loading="lazy" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" width="260"/></a></span>
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
...How bitter. Trite, you should have a taste of this bitterness. It'll calm you down in no time.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
A-Are we talking about your coffee... or something completely different...?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
You don't understand the way the witness thinks.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
How he thinks?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
You remember this, I presume?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The "I broke the vase... sorry" apology lett-- I mean Mr. Kudo's sworn testimony?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Exactly. The old man has one very grievous <span style="color:#E16935">habit</span>... other than throwing seeds. The more of an impression something makes, the more <span style="color:#E16935">muddled</span> his mind makes it. And what's the most striking thing about Mr. Elg?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Clearly, it's the victim's eyepiece.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
And that's my point. The old man strikes again! Mr. Elg's HMD made a big impression on the old man. "I saw the earpiece and those new-fangled spectacles he was wearing! Oh, yes! They were both on his left ear! Do you hear? His left ear!" Ha...! Well, Trite?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Urk... <span style="color:#0070C0">(That's the worst, but best impression of Kudo ever...)</span>
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Wow! I really thought he was Old Seedy for a minute there! Godot's good!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Enough! I must agree that yesterday's witness was irresponsibly rash in much of his testimony.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Bad luck, Nick. Looks like the "boil" of a contradiction you found is just a "rash".
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
A mirror can't be beaten by a handful of seeds, nor can it lie. So... What exactly was the old man looking at? Fill us in, Mr. Armstrong. Go on, tell the court. We're all ears.
</p><p>Armstrong:<br/>
Oui. I can explain. Please, if you will look at la plans of la restaurant.

Alors. Is everyone sitting comfortably?<br/>
La mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.<br/>
Z'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.<br/>
Z'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.<br/>
After la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way.<br/>
But naturally, I did not touch anything else!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... I see no problems with the explanation we have just heard. From the table next to the victim's, Mr. Kudo could have seen the victim in the mirror.
</p><p>Armstrong:<br/>
What a naughty little coquette I am, confusing all z'e men like z'is!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Don't worry about it. We can keep up, except for the guy breaking out in a cold sweat over there again.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Argh! I hate that guy!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You said you didn't touch anything else apart from the mirror. Are you quite sure about that?

It is pretty strange, though, isn't it? I mean, nobody mentioned anything about a really large mirror. You'd think someone would've, but Maggey didn't, and neither did Old Seedy.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Then the only logical explanation is... ...that there was no mirror inside Trés Bien that day. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Now I've just got to prove it... Somehow...)</span>

<p>Phoenix:<br/>
There is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony. Mr. Kudo broke the vase that was on the table <span style="color:#E16935">where he was sitting</span>. And yet! As the court can see, there is an unbroken vase on the table next to the victim! Why? Because Mr. Kudo was not, in fact, sitting at the table next to the victim at all!

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Unfortunately, Mr. Godot, that doesn't quite work for me. Mr. Armstrong already testified to the contrary. In his own words... "I did not touch anything else" except the mirror!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ur... urgh! ... Gaaaaaaaaargh!

<span style="color:#0070C0">(I was right! There was no mirror in the restaurant that day!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
In light of this revelation, we return back to the original problem. Why did the victim have an earpiece in an ear in which he couldn't hear?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! You only get one shot in life. There's no turning back. If you want to claim that the mirror wasn't there, Trite... ...then this problem is all yours. How do you explain what the old man saw?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(If I can answer this, then I'll be that much closer to the truth! I can feel it!)</span>
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
...Are you going to be OK? Can you really solve this contradiction, Nick?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
There's <span style="color:#E16935">more than just this one contradiction</span>, Maya.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
What do you mean?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Remember what Maggey told us? "There was <span style="color:#E16935">another man</span> at the victim's table." And, "there was a <span style="color:#E16935">sample CD</span> on the victim's table." It all flies in the face of Mr. Kudo's testimony. <span style="color:#0070C0">(And I think I know the reason why nothing in this case is adding up.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well, Mr. Wright? Let's hear your answer.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes, Your Honor. The reason behind all the contradictions in Mr. Kudo's testimony is simple.

This case is riddled with contradictions. Yet, there is one very simple answer that clears them all up.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
A-And what is that?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The <span style="color:#E16935">incident</span> Mr. Kudo witnessed, and the <span style="color:#E16935">incident</span> the victim experienced... ...were <span style="color:#E16935">two completely different</span> events!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
What!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes! The "<span style="color:#E16935">victim</span>" that Mr. Kudo saw wasn't <span style="color:#E16935">Mr. Glen Elg</span> at all! It was an <span style="color:#E16935">imposter</span> -- a phony pretending to be Mr. Elg! Obviously, unlike the victim, there was nothing wrong with the imposter's left eardrum. That's how he ended up wearing the earpiece in his left ear by mistake!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Phwoooooooh!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order in the court! Settle down, or I'll clear the courtroom!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Quiet, gramps! Why don't you clear out of here, huh?

</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Trite... Are you saying what Mr. Kudo saw was a <span style="color:#E16935">set-up</span>?

Yes. Someone pretended to be Glen Elg and acted out the whole coffee poisoning. All for the express purpose of creating a "witness" out of one Mr. Victor Kudo!

<p>Kudo:<br/>
The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!

Q-Quoi? What do you mean?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
At the time in question, the victim was listening to the radio with his earpiece. The show he was listening to was "Millionaire Radio". Each week, they announce the winning number of a half million dollar lottery ticket.
</p><p>Armstrong:<br/>
Oui. Z'at must be la show Mon. Elg was listening to.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I can't see any problem with this testimony, Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I wonder...
</p><p>Armstrong:<br/>
...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You say the victim arrived at your restaurant after 2 PM, correct?
</p><p>Armstrong:<br/>
Oui, oui. I am sure of it. I remember it perfectly now! I know it was z'at time, because I 'ad just finished serving la lunch menu.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Get to the point, Trite. If you have one.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That show is broadcast live at <span style="color:#E16935">1:30 PM</span>. And it claims to be "the most thrilling 10 minutes of your life"...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I-It's on the air at 1:30!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Now, supposedly, the victim made some noise when it was announced that he had won. And yet... I don't believe his cry of joy could have occurred after 2 PM! Because the show had already finished more than 30 minutes earlier by that point in time!
</p><p>Armstrong:<br/>
Nooooooooon!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
This "victim" we've been told about has done nothing but the impossible! Listening to the radio with a ruptured eardrum, catching a show that was already over... There is only one conclusion you can draw from these facts! This "victim" was an imposter, acting out the poisoning <span style="color:#E16935">30 minutes</span> after the real murder! Yes, there were <span style="color:#E16935">two Glen Elgs</span> in Trés Bien that day. The real Glen Elg, now dead, having been poisoned by the real killer... ...and the phony Glen Elg, acting out the events for Mr. Kudo to witness!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I-It certainly seems that way... I mean, if that wasn't the case, how could you explain the time discrepancy?

</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Thank you, Trite. That's exactly what I was hoping you would say.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh-What!?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Now, I presume you can prove this theory of yours...? Can you explain where the missing corpse went to!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Th-The <span style="color:#E16935">missing</span> corpse...?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
According to the old man's testimony, there was <span style="color:#E16935">only one other customer</span> there. If that "customer" was the phony Glen Elg... ...then where did the killer hide the body of the real victim!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Naaaaaargh!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The prosecution has a valid point, Mr. Wright. If your theory is to stand up to examination by the court... ...you must provide us with proof by answering the prosecution's question. Where did the killer hide the body?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Y-Yes, Your Honor...
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
No conjecture, Trite. Let's hear some facts for once. Show the court a piece of evidence that proves where the body was hidden!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
E-Evidence!?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Wh-What's with the intense pressure in here all of a sudden!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I thought I had him with that contradiction. But he's turned it all around and backed me into a corner instead!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence. First, where was the body of the real Mr. Elg concealed?

Mr. Armstrong! Do you recognize this bottle?
</p><p>Armstrong:<br/>
Non! Non, non, non! I 'ave never seen z'at ugly bottle before in my life! I only use la very best bottles, monsieur! Z'e 'ighest quality only for me!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Where was that bottle found, Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Interestingly enough, Your Honor. it was found in the kitchen of Trés Bien.
</p><p>Armstrong:<br/>
Eh? Quoi!? But I only ever use z'ese bottles for my aromatherapy oils.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But this bottle doesn't contain aromatherapy oil, Mr. Armstrong. No, it contains a medication.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What kind of medication?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I'm sure everyone remembers, don't they? That Mr. Elg visited an otolaryngological clinic, and was given medication that day!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Y-You can't be serious...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The defense had the contents of the bottle analyzed, and I have the lab results here! The contents of the bottle match the prescription that was given to Mr. Elg!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Bwooooar!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Glen Elg's murderer hid the body in the restaurant kitchen. At which time, this bottle fell out of the victim's pocket. Mr. Armstrong! When the incident occurred, didn't you say you were in the kitchen?
</p><p>Armstrong:<br/>
M-M-Mon dieu!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes, you know about what I'm about to say, It was YOU who hid the victim's body! You did a fine job pretending to defend my client, Maggey Byrde. However! You were setting her up to take the fall behind the poor girl's back!
</p><p>Armstrong:<br/>

</p><p>Armstrong:<br/>
Je vous demande pardon! Please, you must 'ear me out! It is a trap! Listen to me! Por favor!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>

</p><p>Godot:<br/>
I'm only going to ask you once. Did you do it?

Non! Non, non! Absolutely non! I simply... I...
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Let's hear it. You've got one shot. Right, gramps?

A half million dollar loan from a black-market loan shark. And you had no way of paying it back, did you? That's why you were forced to do anything this man told you.
</p><p>Armstrong:<br/>
... Oui, it is as you say.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Mr. Armstrong...
</p><p>Armstrong:<br/>
La Tiger... 'E told me 'e was going to use my restaurant for a business rendez-vous. On la day in question, 'e was meeting la victim to demand z'at 'e repay 'is loan. I don't know why it 'appened like zat! I just did what 'e told me to do. I 'ad no choice! I carried la body and la inconscient Maggey out of la dining area... ...and into z'e kitchen. After z'at, I just tried to forget what I 'ad seen!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I think we can now safely say that the man who forced your hand was Mr. Furio Tigre.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... I do have one further question for you, Mr. Armstrong. The poison and the lottery ticket were recovered from the defendant's apron pocket. Was that your doing as well?
</p><p>Armstrong:<br/>
Non! I knew nothing about z'at! Making it look like it was Maggey who 'ad done it... I was... I was not... It is déspicable!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Godot!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You will summon this Furio Tigre as a witness! I doubt that can be arranged today, so we will adjourn for now. Proceedings will continue tomorrow...
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
...Thirty minutes.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Wh-What!?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
The trial will go on. I'll see to it myself. I need half an hour to get that guy on the stand. Not a minute more.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
H-How the...?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Don't sit back and relax yet, Trite! No one knows if that chef is really telling the truth or not. This trial could still go either way.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well. Your request is granted, Mr. Godot. We will resume once Mr. Tigre is ready to take the stand. Until then... Court is adjourned for a 30 minute recess!

I wish I could agree.

Huh?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
When I cross-examined Mr. Armstrong just now... ...he said he was just doing what The Tiger told him to do. But Godot picked up on it, remember? He pointed out that without proof, we don't know if what he testified is the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span>.

Do you think he really didn't meet Glen Elg?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Not likely. Because I'm convinced this guy's behind the whole thing.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
So you mean... that whole testimony he just gave was a lie?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Of course. So we can't afford to give him time to think of ways to plug the leaks in it. I've got to nail him while I still can!

<p>Phoenix:<br/>
Mr. Tigre. Is there something you'd like to tell the court about these matches?
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
Matches? What youse talkin' about?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
We found them in your office at Tender Lender. They're from "that" restaurant.
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
Wh...!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
If you've really never been to Trés Bien before... ...what was a book of the restaurant's matches doing on your desk!?
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
Youse been snoopin' around in my stuff now too, wiseguy!? What are you', my ball and chain!? Ain't no broad controlling me!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! Well, witness? I think it's time you started telling us the truth, don't you?
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
Grrraaaaargh!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
S-Sorry! I'm terribly sorry! Forgive me!

I ain't no pussy-cat! I don't go back on what I said! But, OK... I was at the joint that day.

I was supposed to meet wid the kid at the restaurant that afternoon.<br/>
When I opened the door to the joint, I saw one ugly scene.<br/>
The guy was laid out over the table, stiff as concrete.<br/>
I figured if the place wasn't hot already, it was gonna be, so I split.<br/>
I heard the cop's sirens on my way out, and I went straight back to my office.

I see... You didn't actually meet with him in the end, then. Well, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, please.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes, Your Honor.
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
Hold it! If I wait around here any longer, I ain't even gonna make the normal express. No more stupid questions.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! No problem. Any time Trite presses you on something irrelevant, I'll see he pays a penalty.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
M-Mr. Godot! That's my job!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>

Obviously... ...the killer is Furio Tigre! No one else could have done it.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Wh-What!? Well, witness?
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
... Grrrah ha hah! Now that's cute! Youse think you can pin this on The Tiger!? Maybe youse don't understand. The Tiger is king of the jungle! So I dares you' to say it again! Come on! You' got the guts!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Y-Y-You can't threaten m-me, Mr. Tigre! I-It's the defense! Go ahead and tell the witness, Mr. Wright! Mr. Wriiight!
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
Sounds to me like it must be you', old man. Youse got guts, I'll give you that.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
M-M-Mr. Wright! Do not leave me to handle this alone!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
...Ha...! Perhaps I can end this embarrassment.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
M-Mr. Godot!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Let's just go back over Mr. Kudo's testimony one more time. The old man didn't see just the <span style="color:#E16935">victim</span>! Oh, no, no, no.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Kudo:<br/>
The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Godot:<br/>
Was the victim he saw the real victim or not? That doesn't matter. The fact remains, he saw the accused put the poison into the coffee!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
...! Yes, it was the waitress who poisoned the coffee--

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
V-Very impressive, Mr. Godot. ...Waiting for my absence to launch your attack!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! Found your pen at last, Trite?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It was in my pocket. *ahem* But anyway... Mr. Kudo witnessed two people that day. He saw the victim, the "supposed" <span style="color:#E16935">Mr. Glen Elg</span>, and the "<span style="color:#E16935">waitress</span>"... from behind.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes... Your point, Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I think the conclusion is obvious. If this "Glen Elg" was really the killer in disguise... ...then surely it's possible the "waitress" was also part of the show.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What!? You mean, the waitress was an imposter as well!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The defendant, Ms. Byrde, fell unconscious immediately after the incident. And someone used her fainting to hatch an elaborate plan to pin the murder on her!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Who on earth was it!? <span style="color:green">Who was this "waitress" that Mr. Kudo witnessed?</span>

<p>Judge:<br/>
W-Who is this woman?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Her name is Viola Cadaverini. She's an employee of Tender Lender.
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
Youse makin' a big mistake... D'you know who Violetta's grandfather is? You' betta be goin' home in an armored truck tonight, if you' know what I mean...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Stop shaking, Nick!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh-Where was I? Yes, the defendant, Ms. Byrde, has stated the following...
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Byrde:<br/>
Well, when I took the coffee over to the victim's table... ...it's true there was <span style="color:#E16935">another customer</span> in the restaurant.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Byrde:<br/>
Umm... She was sort of creepy... And she had a kind of cackling laugh.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Tigre:<br/>
...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
There are just too many contradictions in this case. The "second man" at the victim's table who nobody but Ms. Byrde seems to have seen. The earpiece worn by the victim in his left ear when that eardrum was ruptured! And the radio show he was supposedly listening to half an hour after it was over. There is only one logical explanation that clears up all of these contradictions! The whole incident took place <span style="color:#E16935">twice</span>! Once for real, and once for show! And, Mr. Furio Tigre, the only person who could have committed the crime... ...was you!

Youse alright. I could do with a guy like you' around.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh-What do you mean?
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
OK, I'm in on this game! I'm gonna have to charter a jet to get me to my meetin' now, but... ...I'm gonna give youse one more thing to think about before I go.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Something to think about?
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
Youse got it all wrapped up nice, huh, Wright? But youse missed out one real important thing!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But that can't be!
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
I was in the joint that day. And I met that kid, too.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
But I couldn't have poisoned him, youse hear?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What!? Do you really expect us to believe you now, Mr. Tigre?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! What a troublemaker.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
T-Troublemaker...?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Looks like we're going to need another one for the road. One more steaming cup of hot testimony!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Indeed. Witness, you will explain yourself to the court. I will give you one more chance to testify. What happened that day at Trés Bien between yourself and the victim?
</p>
<hr/>
<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span></center>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- Ties to the Victim --</span></center>
<p>Tigre:<br/>
Yeah, I loaned Elg cash. About 100,000 dollars.<br/>
That day, we was due to have a little chat. The kid had hit his payback date, see?<br/>
So anyway, he tells me he's got no way to pay up.<br/>
I'm about to flatten the guy, when he starts screamin'.<br/>
"Yesss! I won! Half a million bucks!" He got lucky, you' know. Real lucky.<br/>
If that waitress hadn't done what she done, everythin' woulda been over.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Now, I see that the principal amount you loaned to Mr. Elg was 50,000 dollars...
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
Yeah, well. Youse got the vig to take into account. Interest builds up fast, you' know.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's faster than fast! 100,000 dollars is twice his principal!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
And the repayment deadline was December 3rd, the day of the incident in question.
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
Yeah. He was one lucky kid! He got that half a million just in time. So I ain't have no reason to kill the kid. And if I ain't got no motive, you ain't got no case!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(His <span style="color:#E16935">motive</span>? Hmm... He has to have one, but what is it?)</span>

What are you getting at, Trite? What else would a moneylender be after other than money!?

Oh, the moneylender was after money. But money in a totally different league. The kind of money that a single disc like this would fetch!
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What is that?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
A computer virus, Your Honor. A virus called "MC Bomber"!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
A "computer virus"? What does one of those do?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
A computer virus is a program that wreaks havoc on the insides of a computer.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
A "computer"? What does one of those do?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I guess the beard isn't the only part of His Honor that is from the stone age!)</span> I'll explain it to you later, Your Honor. Right now, this is the important point... A virus like "MC Bomber" would be worth <span style="color:#E16935">several million dollars</span> on the black market.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
S-Several million dollars!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Lending money with no hope of ever seeing repayment would normally be bad for business. But in this case, the very fact that Glen Elg had no way to repay the money is crucial.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Glen Elg was a programmer. A highly skilled programmer. That skill was the collateral Mr. Elg put up in order to borrow the money.
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
...
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
<span class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:File"><a class="mw-file-description image" href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445"><img class="mw-file-element lazyload" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" decoding="async" height="192" loading="lazy" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" width="260"/></a></span>
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
You're trying to suggest the witness's motive was to get hold of that program?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Exactly.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
The witness may be poor fashion sense, but he is by no means an idiot, Trite. A man like him could get his hands on one million dollars without resorting to murder.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Of course he could... Provided that he had time. But what if he had needed the money right then? When the pressure's on, the luxury of choice tends to disappear.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
It seems you have a logical conclusion for this theory, Mr. Wright. Would you care to share it with us? <span style="color:green">Why did Mr. Tigre need money to the tune of one million dollars?</span>

O-One million dollars!? A preposterous sum! Someone should sue these HMOs!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! No one would pay a bill like that. If the medical association got wind of it, the hospital would end up as dead as a morgue.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But Mr. Tigre had no choice but to pay! Because his very life depended on it!
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
Grrraaaaaaaargh!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
O-Order! Order! Order! You say his very life depended on it, Mr. Wright!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Indeed it did. Simply because the injured woman was none other than Viola Cadaverini.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
...! Did you say, "Cadaverini"?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Bruto Cadaverini, Mob boss in charge of all underworld activities in the city, and... ...doting grandfather to his precious "Violetta", also known as Viola Cadaverini.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Bwooooar!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Your life was in danger unless you paid "compensation" to the boss, correct? It makes sense! You were desperate to acquire the one million dollars Cadaverini demanded of you! So desperate, in fact, that you decided to sacrifice Glen Elg's life to pay your debt!

About 6 months ago, you were involved in a traffic accident, weren't you? An accident involving a car and a scooter, in which a young woman was injured. She was taken to the hospital, where she underwent surgery.
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
<span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [Wh-Where did youse get all this info...?] in the original release">H-How muccha dis... do youse know...!?</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [Wh-Where did youse get all this info...?] in the original release)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
These medical papers document the treatment of the young woman in question. According to these, her operation cost... one million dollars! <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [Payment for these expenses was due in December of last year, and was paid in full!] in the original release">And yet, when the payment was due last month, you somehow managed to pay it in full!</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [Payment for these expenses was due in December of last year, and was paid in full!] in the original release)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
O-One million dollars!? A preposterous sum! Someone should sue these HMOs!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! No one would pay a bill like that. If the medical association got wind of it, the hospital would end up as dead as a morgue.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But Mr. Tigre had no choice but to pay! Because his very life depended on it!
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
Grrraaaaaaaargh!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
O-Order! Order! Order! You say his very life depended on it, Mr. Wright!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Indeed it did. Simply because the injured woman was none other than Viola Cadaverini.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
...! Did you say, "Cadaverini"?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Bruto Cadaverini, Mob boss in charge of all underworld activities in the city, and... ...doting grandfather to his precious "Violetta", also known as Viola Cadaverini.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Bwooooar!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Your life was in danger unless you paid "compensation" to the boss, correct? It makes sense! You were desperate to acquire the one million dollars Cadaverini demanded of you! So desperate, in fact, that you decided to sacrifice Glen Elg's life to pay your debt!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! Order! What do you say to that, witness?
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
...Grrr... urgh...
</p><p>Godot:<br/>

It's a nice little fairy tale, Trite. But even if the witness did need a million dollars... ...that doesn't tie him to Mr. Elg's murder. Mr. Elg only owed him 100,000 dollars, and had no hope of repaying it anyway!
</p><p>Tigre:<br/>
Yeah. That guy wasn't worth my spit!

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I don't think so. In fact, the opposite is true.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
The opposite?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Lending money with no hope of ever seeing repayment would normally be bad for business. But... In this case, the very fact that Glen Elg had no way to repay the money is crucial.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What!?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Do you know where you're going with this, Nick?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You've got to <span style="color:#E16935">think outside the box</span>, Maya.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Outside the box?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It's very straightforward. Mr. Tigre <span style="color:#E16935">wasn't after the 100,000 dollars</span> at all.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
It seems you have a logical conclusion for this theory, Mr. Wright. Would you care to share it with us? <span style="color:green">What exactly was Mr. Tigre "after"?</span>

The lottery win?

Exactly! At the eleventh hour, Mr. Elg won half a million dollars on the lottery! Which left Mr. Tigre with no way of getting his hands on the all-important CD. At least, no legitimate way. So he resorted to illegitimate means.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
That's crazy!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
He murdered Glen Elg, and then made his next move... To frame Maggey Byrde for the crime! Mr. Tigre posed as Glen Elg... ...while Viola Cadaverini played the role of Ms. Byrde.

</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Do you think I'm some kind of hack detective? Of course I know!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
So? Tell us! They're The Tiger's right? I knew it!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Heh heh heh! You bet! Clear as crystal, all over the bottle! They're Furio Tigre's paw prints alright!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
That's great! We've got him now, Nick!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
What's wrong with you!? You've hardly said a word since Detective Gumshoe got here. He's laid everything on the line for this, Nick.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I know. Look, I'm sorry. This is kind of hard to say, but... It really doesn't make any difference whose prints are on that bottle now.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Huh!? What!? Why not?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What we need to produce at this stage in the trial... ...is irrefutable evidence that The Tiger put poison in Glen Elg's coffee. He's already admitted that he met the victim. The fact that his prints are on this bottle... That's really doesn't make any difference now.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
...! ... I knew it. Great... No matter how hard I try... I'm never of any use.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Hey, don't be so hard on yourself...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
This was our last chance to help Maggey. And I've been working on some useless piece of evidence the whole time! It's alright. I'm a real loser. It's not breaking news to me, pal.
</p><p>???:<br/>
Um...
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
Detective... Gumshoe...?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
M-Maggey!
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
You've been working on something... for me?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
... Sorry I let you down, Maggey. I know you didn't do it. And I'm a detective! We're supposed to be able to prove stuff like that! I'm really sorry! I'll get out of your hair now.
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
Detective Gumshoe! Wait!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

Uh... I'm not sure I follow you.

It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...

You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.

...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...

How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?

They aren't, are they...

Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.

That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Maggey Byrde...

The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!
