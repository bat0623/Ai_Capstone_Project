...?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Don't "...?" at me! It's pretty obvious, isn't it? I mean, take a look at this. It clearly says, "<span style="color:#E16935">I AM</span>" on the urn in the poster. But the urn we got back says, "<span style="color:#E16935">AMI</span>", like it always used to.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Oh yeah... You're right.

Plus, the vase has pink splotches on it now... ...I'm sure they wasn't there before!

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Maya doesn't know, but <span style="color:#E16935">1 year ago</span>... when the urn was broken... ...the repairer accidentally turned Mystic <span style="color:#E16935">Ami</span>'s name into "<span style="color:#E16935">I AM</span>".

So... I guess people still go to Kurain Village to do their training, right?

Yup. If you want to become a spirit medium, you need to undergo severe training.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So why haven't you been training lately, Maya?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Well... Lately I've been thinking of heading to a channeling dojo to do just that.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
A "channeling dojo", huh...? Sounds pretty serious, whatever that is.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
If you're going to train, you have to be serious. Otherwise real tragedies can happen.

Is what happened last year still bothering you...?

When a medium uses the Kurain Technique, she temporarily loses her own will.

Sure was, pal! That prosecutor made real fools out of us...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yeah... I feel for you.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Wow, that's not like you at all... I thought you'd be more like... "Oh, that was great! You guys got what you deserved, pal! Ho ho ho ho!" Or something to that effect.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
D-Do I really sound like that to you, pal?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
If the Gumshoe fits...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Um... Well, anyway... The point is I can tell when someone puts their heart into their jobs. And I can sympathize when things don't go your way. ...Sometimes, I feel like "wrong" is the only way things go for us detectives.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Wow, I had no idea Detective Gumshoe was such a nice guy.

Mr. DeLite, do you still insist that you are Mask☆DeMasque...?
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
Isn't that what I've been saying since yesterday?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
That was a quick response...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Tell me about it. To be honest, it's starting to get irritating.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
B-But listen, Mr. DeLite! At the trial today, we learned the true identity of the thief, didn't we!?

Of course not. After all, you were at KB Security at the time.

So that night, you didn't go to <span style="color:#E16935">Lordly Tailor</span>, you went to <span style="color:#E16935">KB Security</span>, right?
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
Yes... I went to KB Security at the time the blackmail note said I should.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Alright... What happened next?
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
Well, I used to work there, so I knew where the CEO's office was. I knocked... but there was no answer. So then I used the key card to unlock the door.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's probably when he dropped his wallet...)</span>
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
When I went into the CEO's office... someone was in there.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
"Someone"...?
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
Then suddenly they bashed me over the head! Bam!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Was it Kane Bullard that hit you...?
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
I don't know. The person ran away while I was still stunned. When I came to my senses, the sight I saw left me speechless. The dead body of the CEO was right there in front of me! I thought I'd die myself! Anyway, I thought I should do something with the body...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So that's why you put it in the safe...?
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
...Yes, that's right. I used to be the chief of one of the security teams, so I knew how to open it.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
OK... And what did you do after that?
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
Well, I got out of there, for starters! I was the one who set up the <span style="color:#E16935">security cameras</span> in that building... ...so I knew <span style="color:#E16935">how to avoid being spotted</span> by them!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>

</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Why have you been hiding it from her anyway?
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
Dessie would despise me if she ever found out I was living a <span style="color:#E16935">life of crime</span>. A criminal, a thief... She'd never forgive me! My marriage would be over!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Knowing that, why did you become a thief in the first place?
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
Because Dessie spends money like it's water. There's no job in the world that could bring in enough money... Except being a thief. At least, that's what I thought anyway.

</p><p>Ron:<br/>
Ah, it's not easy being a master thief, you know! "I've got proof that it was you, so give up!" it went on to say. So in the end, I had to give up the treasure I went through all that trouble to steal...

</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Well... That's not so hard to understand. Is it, Pearly?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
N-No, not at all! I... know just how she feels!
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
It happened about 2 weeks ago. Just after the poster photo was taken, on the same day the urn arrived here... ...I thought I'd put it away down here for safe-keeping. I was carrying it in the box... ...when I tripped on a paint can and lost my balance! The box I was carrying crashed to the ground!
</p>
<hr/>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">...*CRASH*...</span></center>
<hr/>
<p>Andrews:<br/>
I heard a terrible noise and I thought my heart was going to stop... Fearing the worst, I opened the lid of the box and that's when it happened! The broken pieces of the urn fell out of the box and landed right in the paint! I... I... I was in shock... And let out a huge scream!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
...Hmm. I can totally see how that could've happened.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yeah, as clumsy as she is, I'm sure Maya understands...)</span>
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Well, I knew it was the most important treasure in all of Kurain Village... ...so I tried as hard as I could to fix it. Fortunately, the shards were pretty big.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
And that's when the "<span style="color:#E16935">I AM</span>" got changed to "<span style="color:#E16935">AMI</span>"?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
I-I didn't know how it was originally written. But any sane person fixing it would have assumed it said, "<span style="color:#E16935">AMI</span>"...
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
A-Any sane person...? Really?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Oh, Pearls... She said she wasn't very good at spelling...)</span>
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Anyway, I put the urn into the storeroom and no one had seen it since then.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
But... There's something I don't get... When we first came here, I didn't see any paint stains.
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Well, that's because it was so ugly and embarrassing. I used the golden statue to cover it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The Ami Fey statue... Aha!)</span>

The first time that we came down here... It was on the night that the Sacred Urn was stolen.
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
But Mr. Nick... There were no paint marks on the walls or floor of the warehouse when we were here.
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Well, there's a good reason for that. On the day of the crime, around noon... ...that <span style="color:#E16935">golden statue</span> just happened to arrive from the mountain training hall.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
A-And?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
I realized that the statue would be the perfect size for <span style="color:#E16935">covering up the paint stains</span>. That's why... I put it where you first saw it.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
I see... Now it makes perfect sense.
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Um, but there's still one thing I find strange...
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
What is it, Pearl?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
The day after the urn was stolen, we came here again... At that time, the statue had been moved and the paint was clearly visible.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She's right about that...)</span> Well, Ms. Andrews?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Huh! What? I, err... I don't know anything about that! I placed it there to cover the paint, so why would I move it again?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Well then who was it? Who would have done it and why...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(On the day before the theft, the statue was definitely <span style="color:#E16935">closer to the door</span>! Then the next day, <span style="color:#E16935">it was moved</span>. But why...?)</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Ami Fey's Golden Statue updated in the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It looks like... ...there's some connection between the Sacred Urn and the murder case.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Wh-Why? Why do you think so, Nick?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Because that night... the real thief, Ron DeLite, was at KB Security. ...So then why did another Mask☆DeMasque show up here? A lot of different things are pointing to one undeniable fact.

One undeniable fact...?
