Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Whew, it's finally time... I'm kind of nervous...)</span>
</p><p>???:<br/>
*Ah-HHHHEM!*
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Oh! Mr. Grossberg! Good morning!
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
Ah, Mia. Please calm yourself down! You're going to get yourself arrested for suspicious behavior, you know.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
What are you talking about!! I am relaxed, Mr. Grossberg!! Look at me, I'm relaxed!!
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
*Grrrmmphh* L-Let go of my lapels! Hmph... You obviously haven't got the temperament to be a lawyer.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
I, err... I'm so sorry! It's just that I'm so nervous today...
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
Oh, that's right. This is your first time in the big leagues, isn't it? Well, never you fear my dear. I, Marvin Grossberg, am at your service!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Umm, actually this is my <span style="color:#E16935">second time</span> in court...
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
Still, you surprised me... What, with your earnest request last night... "Let me handle this case!" you suddenly said. And quite forcefully, too!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
I just found out yesterday. About the case, I mean.
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
What? And you've already learned all the relevant facts?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Well about that... You see... I mean, of course I have! I think.
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
Oh dear... In any case, don't let our client see you're so nervous. You see the poor young man in the pink sweater over there? That's our client.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
*cough* *sniffle* Good morning there everybody!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Good morning... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Try to keep smiling, Mia!)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I, err, I just want to say... I'll give it all I've got! Yup, it'll be fine! No prob! *cough* *achoo* *achoo*
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Oh, what's wrong? Do you have a cold or something... Mr. Wry?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Actually, it's <span style="color:#E16935">Wright</span>... Like the flying brothers... People screw it up all the time. And yes I have a cold. That's what this mask is for. My doc says this way, I won't give it to anyone else... Be kind to others, he says...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Right, Mr. Wright! You have nothing to fear in court today! If you are truly innocent... I promise I will save you!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Nnnnggghh... P-Please l-let go of my shirt... *cough*
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's right, he's the one on trial, not you! He's the one who should be nervous! You need to stay strong for your client, Mia!)</span>

<p>Mia:<br/>
My name is Mia Fey. I'm still pretty new at this lawyer thing... The first time I appeared in court was a year ago. But that trial traumatized me so badly, I thought I'd never set foot in another courtroom. It's been one year since then, and well, here I am again. <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [But this time...

<center><span style="color:green">April 11, 10:00 AM<br/>District Court<br/>Courtroom No. 2</span></center>
<p><br/>
Judge:<br/>
Court is now in session for the trial of Phoenix Wright.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
The defense is ready, Your Honor!
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The defense today is... Ms... Ms... Mia Fey, was it?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Y-Yes, Your Honor. Is there a problem?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I was under the impression that Marvin Grossberg was to be leading the defense.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Yes! Well, you see... Mr. Grossberg had... A-A bit of an emergency...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Emergency? But isn't that him standing there right next to you?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Yes, well...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You... You're just a rookie. Are you sure you can really handle this?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Don't let him scare you, Mia! Give him your toughest look!)</span> Of course, Your Honor! ... I think.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... Well, Mr. Payne. Your opening statement, please.
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Well, well, well... I can't believe a veteran like me has to spend his time baby-sitting a new defense lawyer.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Don't worry little girl. It will all be over soon.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What was that all about? Was he trying to trash-talk me?)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Now then, I'd like to proceed with a summary of events on the day in question. The incident occurred on the campus of Ivy University. The murder victim was a student named Doug Swallow. He was a fourth year student studying Pharmacology.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... It sounds like he was a very bright young man.
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Yes, well, next we have a photo taken at the scene of the crime. Students discovered the scene shortly after the murder. They found the victim's body... ...and the defendant, who had obviously bungled his getaway. They then called the police.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... That certainly makes the defendant look very suspicious indeed. Very well. The court accepts this photo into the record as evidence.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Crime Photo 1 added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
By the way... I can't quite tell the <span style="color:#E16935">cause of death</span> from this photo.
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Hee, hee, hee... Your reputation for sagacity is well-earned, Your Honor. The truth is that this victim died a rather <span style="color:#E16935">unusual death</span>.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
An unusual death...!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What do you mean, Mr. Payne!?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Well... Perhaps the defense would like to take this question.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Huh...!?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
A simple question. I thought I might loosen you up a bit. I am a genteel-man, if you will.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Um, a what? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Stand up to him, Mia! Show him what you're made of!)</span>
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
Ah, a perfect opportunity! Well, what was it? The cause! Go on! ... ...Please say you know at least this much.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
I-I'm so sorry... I-I didn't get a chance to read through the whole file.
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
*groan* My hemorrhoids are beginning to act up... Now see here! The details of the case are filed under the <span style="color:#E16935">Court Record</span>. But you knew that already, didn't you?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>

</p><p>Mia:<br/>

<p>Mia:<br/>
According to the Court Record, it was a fatal electric shock. In other words, <span style="color:#E16935">electrocution</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Electrocution? Hmm... But how could such a thing happen? Did the murderer use some type of new, super-powerful stun-gun, perhaps?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
The answer to that will become crystal clear as this trial proceeds, Your Honor. But before that, there is one more vital issue.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Wh-What's that?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Why, <span style="color:#E16935">motive</span> of course. Apparently there was some bad blood between the victim and the defendant.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Bad blood...?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Wh-What do you mean...?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Oopsie! I'm terribly sorry. You're the defense attorney, so you must know all about it. I shouldn't be stealing your spotlight like this.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I really don't like this guy's smug attitude...)</span>
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
That's Winston Payne for you. He is one smooth operator, if you catch my drift. They don't call him the "Rookie Killer" for nothing, you know.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Now then, let's hear from the defense. What was the source of the bad blood between the victim and the defendant? And this time, I would like to see some supporting <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span>!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Ev-Evidence...?
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
Ah, no need to get all worked up over this. As I said, all our weapons can be found in the <span style="color:#E16935">Court Record</span>. Find the evidence you need and then shove it into Ol' Graybeard's face!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Y-Yes, sir! Into Ol' Graybeard's face!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Err, Mr. Grossberg. Try to set a better example for the young lady!
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
Mia, <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span> isn't the only thing in the Court Record. People's <span style="color:#E16935">profiles</span> are as well. <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [You can toggle between Profiles and Evidence, so be sure to go over it all!] in the original release">You can <span style="color:#E16935">toggle</span> between <span style="color:#E16935">Profiles</span> and <span style="color:#E16935">Evidence</span> with [the <span style="color:#E16935">R Button</span> / Tab], so be sure to go over it all!</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [You can toggle between Profiles and Evidence, so be sure to go over it all!] in the original release)</span>

</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Grossberg... I honestly think it would be best for the defense if you were in charge. I'm afraid Ms. Fey might stir up some bad blood with this court if she were to continue.
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
Or simply put, you are quite mistaken, m'dear.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Oh no... I'm so sorry...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Even if you are new, your lack of preparation is inexcusable. Now take a moment and think it over again.

Y-Yes, Your Honor! <span style="color:#0070C0">(It's OK! You've got another chance, Mia!)</span>

<p>Mia:<br/>
The reason for the bad blood between the two of them was... this woman here.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Dahlia Hawthorne, is it?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Very good, Ms. Fey. You seem to have picked up on at least this much. This woman is the girlfriend of the defendant, Phoenix Wright. But up until about eight months ago, she was with the victim, Mr. Swallow. Clearly she has some part to play in this story.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm...
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
Ah, he's done it again. Before the cross-examination starts, he's already got the judge thinking like he wants.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well, Mr. Payne. Please call your first witness!
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
If it pleases the court, the prosecution would like to call Mr. Phoenix Wright.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What? The defendant himself? Well, Ms. Fey?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's fine! After all, Mr. Wright is innocent, right?)</span> The defense has no objection.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well. The court calls Mr. Phoenix Wright to the witness stand!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Payne:<br/>
Witness, please state your name and occupation.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Oh, ah, yes... My name is Phoenix Wright. My job is, um... Well, right now, I guess I'm a suspect.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
No, no. He means what did you do before you were arrested?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Oh... *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* I was a university student.
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Mr. Wright. You understand that you are suspected in the death of your fellow student, Doug Swa--
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But! But I didn't do it! I'm innocent I tell you! I'm telling you I was... *achoo* *achoo* *cough* *cough* *achoo* *cough*
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Would the defendant please refrain from passing on his cold to the rest of us!
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
It seems the witness has something he wants to say.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... Well then, Mr. Wright. Please tell us about your relation to the victim.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Right away, Your Honor!

<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span></center>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- The Victim and I --</span></center>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
Um, I... I admit I was there...<br/>
But I'm not a killer! All I did was find his body!<br/>
I hardly knew the guy to begin with...<br/>
I never even talked to that stuck-up British wannabe!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... I see. So you hardly knew the victim?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Right! Like I said, I'm not a killer!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Whew... It looks like the judge understands.
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
Mmfph... You're being naïve, you know. Too naïve.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Huh...?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee. It seems that you've forgotten one small thing, young lady.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
And that would be...?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
This witness still has to undergo something called <span style="color:#E16935">cross-examination</span>.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Cross-examination...?
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
He's right. And it's the defense's duty to carry out the <span style="color:#E16935">cross-examination</span>. The purpose is to determine if a witness's testimony contains any <span style="color:#E16935">contradictions</span>.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#E16935">Contradictions</span>...?
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
If a witness is lying, their statements will <span style="color:#E16935">conflict</span> with the Court Record.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
But... Mr. Wright is my client!

An "alchemist"... I see...

Well naturally... it's right around here! ...I think.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Ms. Fey, I'm deeply disappointed in you.
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
I'm disappointed as well, Ms. Fey.
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
To be honest, I'm a bit disappointed too, Mia.

"Ms. Fey, where exactly in this photo is the murder weapon?"
</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Mia:<br/>
Well, naturally... it's right here!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
That's... That's... What is that?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
A severed <span style="color:#E16935">electrical cable</span>, I believe... Your Honor. Remember the testimony we've heard. The machines the pharmacology students use in their experiments require high voltage... ...and because of that, there are <span style="color:#E16935">special high-voltage cables</span> strung up everywhere!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
So then, the high-voltage cable...!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Yes, the <span style="color:#E16935">high-voltage cable</span> is the cause of death. That is the most likely explanation!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... That certainly sounds plausible. Well, Mr. Payne? What do you have to say about this?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Well... I believe some praise is in order.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Don't toy with me, old man!
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Now, now. The victim's cause of death may indeed have been a high-voltage cable. However! I want you to think about what that really implies! The only one who had the opportunity to use the cable as a <span style="color:#E16935">murder weapon</span> was... The defendant!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
... *achoo*
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... That much is certainly true.
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Yes, and that's not all. We have <span style="color:#E16935">proof</span>. Irrefutable proof that will establish that Mr. Wright was the murderer.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Y-You do!? Well, what is it!?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
His <span style="color:#E16935">fingerprints</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Fingerprints...? You mean that the defendant's fingerprints were on something besides the medicine bottle?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Let's take another look at the crime scene photo. As you can see, the victim is wearing a <span style="color:#E16935">leather jacket</span>. And as you may know, leather holds <span style="color:#E16935">fingerprints</span> quite well.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Ah! Y-You mean...?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Yes. It was quite clearly imprinted on the chest area of the victim's jacket. The <span style="color:#E16935">palm print</span> of the defendant's very own hand!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Wh-Whaaat!?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
I can only think of one way Mr. Wright could have left a print like that. Intent on murder, he squarely pushed the victim towards the severed electrical cable!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! Order! That's enough! I think we can conclude that there is no reason to continue with this cross-examination.
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
Stick a fork in us, we're done.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
M-Mr. Grossberg!
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
My hemorrhoids never lie. The show is over, Mia. I knew that boy was guilty the first time I saw him.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
N-No! You're wrong! Mr. Wright is innocent.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
No further evidence is required to convince me of this man's guilt!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Y-Your Honor...!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
At this time, I am prepared to render a verdict in this case!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>

That guy... He was talking bad about Dollie...<br/>
I lost my temper and gave him a shove!<br/>
At that moment, I heard some kind of loud noise...<br/>
A little while after I left, I started to get worried.<br/>
So I went back. But h-he was just lying there, d-dead!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Payne:<br/>
Well, the explanation is really quite simple. When you pushed him, Mr. Swallow flew back and touched the electrical cable. He died from the shock. And that, as they say, is that.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... A simple explanation indeed.
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
At the time of the incident, a light rain had been falling. Wet from the rain, the victim was more easily electrocuted.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
B-But! When I pushed him, there weren't any electrical cables nearby! If there had been something like that, even I would've noticed it!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>

And when you did that, there was no severed cable anywhere to be seen?

Yes, I did! I admit it! I-I was furious!

Come on... If I had mentioned that...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
I would've been able to counter the prosecution's arguments earlier!
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Wh-What do you mean by that?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Take another look at the crime scene photo! According to Mr. Wright, the victim fell on top of his umbrella. However, if you look closely... ...the umbrella is nowhere near the victim. Actually, it's by the electrical pole!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Y-You're absolutely right!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
The conclusion here is obvious. After the defendant left, the victim <span style="color:#E16935">moved</span> from where he fell. In other words... After he was pushed by the defendant, Mr. Swallow was still alive!
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Nnnnooooo!!

Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Dahlia Hawthorne? You don't mean... "Dollie"?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
I do, Your Honor. The defendant's very own lover is a witness to the whole thing! That's right. She was at the <span style="color:#E16935">scene of the crime</span> when the murder took place!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Whaaaat!?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
I'm sorry to break the bad news to you, my dear.

... "Bad news"? You couldn't be more wrong. Actually... I've been waiting for this.
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
You can't be serious...
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
Mia! What do you mean by that...?

Miss Fey... I-I'm sorry about what happened back there... I... I...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
It's alright. At least you told us the truth in the end, Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah... So I guess I can start to relax then, huh?
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
Relax, my boy? You can't be serious! After hiding such important facts...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
B-But...! But the next witness is my Dollie, right? She'll save me! I just know she will!

Why do you think that?

Huh!? What do you mean!? She... She's the <span style="color:#E16935">love of my life</span>, that's why!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
The love of your life, huh... Would you mind telling me more about you and... Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Sure! No problem! Dollie and I... We first met about eight months ago right here in this very courthouse. Actually, I'm studying to be a lawyer, on the side... Anyway! One day, she and I just bumped into each other in the reading room downstairs. That's why I really think it was <span style="color:#E16935">fate</span> that brought us together. As soon as I first set eyes on her, I knew she was the one for me. Oh, here! Take a look at this!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
She gave this to me the day we met as a <span style="color:#E16935">symbol of our love</span>! She had been wearing it around her neck that day, but then... ...she took it off, but before she gave it to me she said, "I want you to carry this."
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
So she gave it to you as a present, I see.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
This darling little bottle is filled with memories of my darling little Dollie!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
It certainly is a little bottle alright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
What a strange girl, asking for a present back like that...

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Just what kind of thoughts DO occur to this guy anyway?)</span> This entire case is built on the premise that Mr. Doug Swallow was "<span style="color:#E16935">murdered</span>"... ...but that very premise itself is mistaken! The defense believes that Mr. Swallow was, in fact, the victim of a <span style="color:#E16935">stray bolt</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I-It appears the defense may be on to something! Could it be that the death was actually accidental?

</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee... I'm hurt that you have such a low opinion of me, Ms. Fey.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Huh...?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
I'm not a fool, you know. The prosecution has done its research, Your Honor. We found that there were <span style="color:#E16935">no lightning strikes</span> on that day at that location!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Whaaa!?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
What's more... We have <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span> that the electrical cable is definitely linked to this case.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
E-Evidence, Mr. Payne!? Well, what is this evidence?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
This affidavit.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
And who is this affidavit from?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
The Pharmacology students who were conducting experiments in their labs that day. Allow me to read out to the court the testimony of the Pharmacology students. "<span style="color:#E16935">All equipment in the labs lost power</span> all of a sudden at around <span style="color:#E16935">3:00 PM</span> that day."
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Was it a blackout?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
All of the labs' equipment runs of <span style="color:#E16935">high-voltage</span>, Your Honor.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
So you're saying the equipment lost power because...
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Precisely. They lost power because of the <span style="color:#E16935">severed electrical cable</span>. The power outage occurred at approximately <span style="color:#E16935">3:00 PM</span>...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Which fits with the <span style="color:#E16935">time of death</span> listed in the autopsy report.
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Exactly! In other words... The victim died as a result of touching the severed electrical cable. According to the students, the cables were very old. They were planning on having them replaced in the near future.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm, I see...
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Apparently the cables had become so brittle... ...that even the smallest <span style="color:#E16935">bump</span> would've caused them to break.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Students' Testimony added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
However... There is one thing that troubles me. If the cable <span style="color:#E16935">could have been broken by any small bump</span>... ...then <span style="color:#E16935">it wouldn't have snapped</span> if it hadn't been bumped into, correct?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
W-Well... I suppose you could say that.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm, Ms. Fey. Do you have any thoughts regarding the cause of the severed cable?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Y-Your Honor... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I don't like how this is looking one bit! I have to come up with something to try to regain some momentum!)</span> If it pleases the court, the defense would like to state its opinion.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well then, let's hear it. <span style="color:green">Who or what was it that caused the cable to break?</span>

<p>Mia:<br/>
Your Honor. Please think back to Mr. Wright's testimony.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The defendant's testimony?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
He said that after he pushed the victim, he heard a <span style="color:#E16935">loud, sharp noise</span>. Now, this happened at around 3:00 PM, correct?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes, that sounds right. Wait! Are you saying that...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
The lab equipment lost power at 2:55 PM... which fits right in Mr. Wright's timeline. In other words, it was <span style="color:#E16935">Mr. Wright's shove</span> that caused the power outage.
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Yes! The prosecution also came to that same conclusion. And it was that very shove that caused Mr. Swallow to be electrocuted!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:File"><a class="mw-file-description image" href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445"><img class="mw-file-element lazyload" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" decoding="async" height="192" loading="lazy" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" width="260"/></a></span>
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
I'm afraid I can't agree with you there, Mr. Payne.
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Wh-What's that supposed to mean?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Take a good look at <span style="color:#E16935">where the victim landed</span> after being shoved. See the umbrella? It's by the <span style="color:#E16935">electrical pole</span>. That's right. The victim banged into that pole as a result of being pushed. It was that impact that caused the <span style="color:#E16935">cable to break</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... Well, that makes sense. And then the victim was electrocuted.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
I'm sorry Your Honor, but no. It doesn't make sense at all. If the victim was shoved into the far <span style="color:#E16935">pole</span>... ...then he couldn't have been electrocuted by this severed cable in the foreground here!
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
AAAAAAAAAAHH!!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
In other words... <span style="color:#E16935">Someone other than my client</span> must have electrocuted the victim!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order in the court!

The truth is... Feenie pushed him twice.<br/>
The first time was into the electrical pole. That's when the cable broke.<br/>
Then Dougie tried his best to run away from him...<br/>
But Feenie caught up and crashed into him from behind.<br/>
The cable snapping, and Dougie being electrocuted -- it all occured <i>[sic]</i> in less than a minute.

My point is this! What time was it when the lab <span style="color:#E16935">suffered that power outage</span> due to the cable snapping?

So in essence, the main reason Ms. Hawthorne was never arrested for this crime... ...was because no one could show how she could have obtained the poison.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Then all we have to do is find a way to establish how she could've gotten some, right? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Great... Now just how did a lit. student get a hold of poison, of all things...?)</span>

What...!?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
In fact, you had easy access to that kind of poison, didn't you? At your boyfriend's lab!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
B-Boyfriend!? You mean the victim, Doug Swallow!?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
That's right. Up until eight months ago, Ms. Hawthorne was dating Mr. Swallow. And if you'll recall, Mr. Swallow was a <span style="color:#E16935">Pharmacology</span> student at Ivy University.
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Ph-Ph-Pharmacology...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
His laboratory contained highly advanced chemistry equipment. In fact, without such equipment... ...the culprit could never have obtained such a rare and <span style="color:#E16935">special poison</span>!
</p><p>Dahlia:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Well, Ms. Hawthorne? It seems you had access to such a poison after all. And then, it was a matter of slipping it into the victim's coffee when he wasn't looking. The only person who could've done that was the one sitting at his very table -- you!

May I say something, Madame Fey?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
What is it, Ms. Hawthorne?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br/>
The amount of poison in the coffee was 2 teaspoons, correct? In order to carry that much liquid... you would need some kind of <span style="color:#E16935">container</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well, yes... That's true.
</p><p>Dahlia:<br/>
I was searched immediately after the incident took place.
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Quite true. In fact the entire courthouse was turned upside down.
</p><p>Dahlia:<br/>
But... they didn't find a suspicious container anywhere, did they?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She's right... They even mentioned that in the report!)</span> W-Well, you could've easily gotten rid of something that small!
</p><p>Dahlia:<br/>
Excuse me, Madame, but this is a court of law! If you're saying I threw the poison container away... ...I think you need to show some kind of proof!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
P-Proof...!? <span style="color:#0070C0">(She got me good with that!)</span>

Provide some evidence or I'll have to disallow this line of questioning, Ms. Fey!

The day that the witness met and fell for Mr. Phoenix Wright was eight months ago... August 27th. The very same day as the poisoning incident.

I'm sorry, Miss Fey. It totally slipped my mind. I'm really, really sorry... I know you believed in me, and I feel like I really let you down.

Mr. Wright... What are you trying to say?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Um... There's something I forgot to tell you.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That day... The day I met Doug Swallow...

Th-That's ridiculous!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
There's one more thing... After I pushed him that day... I got worried and came back to have a look. And she was there... Dollie was right there. She was crouched down next to him...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
What!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
She told me not to ever tell anyone about it, but... I'm sorry, Dollie!

Th-That's preposterous!! After all, it was Doug Swallow that was murdered!

Well, it's true that that's how things worked out... But, let's remember that Mr. Swallow died of <span style="color:#E16935">electrocution</span>, not <span style="color:#E16935">poison</span>. The person that Ms. Hawthorne was planning to poison was in fact... You, Phoenix Wright. There's no one else that it could be.

The bottle necklace. That's all she cared about.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
But even so... Why... Why would she go so far as to murder him!?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Eight months ago, just after the fall of that attorney in the basement cafeteria... Dahlia Hawthorne could think of only one thing. <span style="color:#E16935">How to get rid of the bottle necklace as quickly as possible</span>!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
N-No... It-It can't be...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
It was a pretty good move she made, too. The <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span> was missing for a long time. But there was just one <span style="color:#E16935">big problem</span>. Although she got him to hide the evidence, Mr. Wright refused to return it to her. To him, the tiny little bottle was a cherished <span style="color:#E16935">treasure</span>. He even showed it to everyone he met!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Y-You mean... TH-THAT'S why she tried to kill Mr. Wright...?

Correct, Your Honor. It was to retrieve that piece of evidence.

</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Now you're really grasping at straws! After all, it was the victim, Doug Swallow, that was holding the medicine.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
I would like the court to recall the crime that happened here eight months ago. <span style="color:#E16935">Where</span> did Ms. Hawthorne <span style="color:#E16935">hide the evidence</span>?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Huh? What are you talking about?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Eight months ago, the poison was hidden <span style="color:#E16935">in her bottle necklace</span>... ...which she then gave to someone else for safekeeping. Someone she had accidentally run into in the reading room: my client, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Yes, that's right... She did the same thing this time as well. After shoving the victim, Mr. Phoenix Wright left the scene of the crime. That is when the murderer, Dahlia Hawthorne, appeared. With her, she was carrying the poisoned bottle of Coldkiller X. This, of course, was so she could carry out her plan to murder Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm, I believe she did testify that she was going to meet with the defendant.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Yes, and she heard and saw everything that happened at the scene of the crime. Including what the defendant and victim were arguing about, and the cut electrical cable.
</p><p>That's when she realized, <span style="color:#0070C0">"I can't allow Doug Swallow to live!"</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
She used the severed electrical cable to silence him forever. Unfortunately for her, this is when the problem occurred. Mr. Wright, who she thought had left the scene, came back to check on the victim. And on top of that, because of the power outage, some students showed up as well. It's hardly any wonder that she was, as she put it, in a state of panic. Recall that she was carrying that bottle of poisoned cold medicine. She must have thought, "What if they search me like they did eight months ago?"
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
E-Eight months ago...?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Yes, she disposed of the evidence exactly the same way as she did back then! She had someone else hold it! In this case... Doug Swallow!

Hmm... I wonder which one of us is the desperate one? So, Ms. Hawthorne. This cold medicine... I wonder if you wouldn't mind taking some?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br/>
...!?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Well, Mr. Wright ate that necklace of yours, right? Now it's your turn to prove your innocence. What do you say?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
If I'm just a filthy, stinking liar, then there's no need to worry. So come on! Show us! I dare you to take some of this medicine right now!
</p><p>Dahlia:<br/>
... ...Grr... Nngghh... Hnnn... MIA FEY...! MIA... FEYYYY...!! Do. You. Think. You've. Won? Well!? Do you, Mia Fey?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Dahlia:<br/>
Heh... Heh... Heh... Heheh... That's. Just. Fine! For the time being... victory is yours.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
"For the time being"?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br/>
Well... I have a very long memory, you know. You and I will meet again... I'm certain of it.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
...?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br/>
Well then, Mr. Judge... I'll see you later too, OK?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Huh...!? Err, why, um... Y-Yes...
</p><p>Dahlia:<br/>
I'm going to go spend a little quality time with the men in blue now. I wish you all the best.

B-But even so, your witness seems to have accepted it...
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
I don't care!! I'm Winston Payne! And I don't believe one word that this rookie lawyer has said!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Well then, Mr. Payne, let me ask you this.

Y-Yes!?

Would you care to try this cold medicine?
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
WHAT!?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Just a little earlier, I could've sworn you said...
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Payne:<br/>
There, there... It's alright, rookie.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Payne:<br/>
For example, I would trust the witness, Ms. Hawthorne, with my very life!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Mia:<br/>
So, if she's so trustworthy... ...then I'm sure there <span style="color:#E16935">couldn't possibly be any poison in here</span>, right?

</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Y-Y-Yes, Your Honor! I'll file papers for her immediate arrest...

Grossberg:<br/>
Mia! You were wonderful in there!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Thank you for everything, Mr. Grossberg.
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
During the verdict, I thought my hemorrhoids were going to explode like Mt. Vesuvius!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Umm, Mr. Grossberg... Do you, um, maybe think you could stop talking about them?
</p><p>Grossberg:<br/>
Hmph! That's rather rude. Anyway, this case really made me think. What does it really mean to have a relationship of mutual trust with the client? Perhaps it is we veteran lawyers who have lost sight of this.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Oh! Mr. Wright...! Congratulations!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Th-Thanks... Um, you know... I was thinking...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Go on...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The Dollie that I saw up there on the witness stand... I don't think that was really her.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Um, what?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah... The Dollie I know could NEVER have said those kinds of terrible things... Maybe... Maybe she was like... I don't know... A fake or something.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Boy... This poor kid still hasn't got a clue...)</span> You need to forget about her, Mr. Wright. For your own sake...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah, you're right... That's probably for the best.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Also... You need to relax a bit more. Try to grow up a little.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
B-But... Out of all my friends, everyone says I'm the most grown up!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Eek! What kind of company must this guy keep!?)</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
... Right now I... I'm studying to become a lawyer myself.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
That's what you keep saying... But I thought you were in the Art Department?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [Well, yeah... I guess I am...] in the original release">Well, yeah... I am...</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [Well, yeah... I guess I am...] in the original release)</span> But there's a friend that I desperately want to help! And if I hurry, then I should still be able to save him in time!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
I see.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Say, Miss Fey? A lawyer is someone who can help people when they're in trouble, right?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Mr. Wright, I'm still new at this myself. But... I think that's exactly what a lawyer is.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
OK... I'm going to do it. I'll study my butt off. I'll become a lawyer for sure! I hope... I hope we see each other again some day, maybe even in court.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
It's been five years since I was acquitted of all charges. I became a lawyer like I planned, and managed to save my friend. But Mia has passed on to a better place. For me, this trial brings up a lot of painful memories. But... it also brings up some very precious ones. And memories that I thought would never rise to the surface again... Mia is gone now. But even so... I can hear her in my mind.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Mia:<br/>
Phoenix, no matter what, always believe in your client. In a court of law, your greatest weapon is your belief.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
...Five long years... Something has happened that's made me think back to her words of wisdom... But that is a story for another day...
