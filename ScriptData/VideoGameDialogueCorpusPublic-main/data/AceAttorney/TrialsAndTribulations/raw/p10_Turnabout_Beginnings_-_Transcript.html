The girl... Let her go!
</p><p>Shut up! C-Come closer... And I kill her!
</p><p>Sorry, but you're not going to get the chance...

<hr/>
<p>I'm reading through the file of an old court case. It was the first case of my long-time mentor, Mia Fey...
</p>
<hr/>
<center><b>Fugitive Data</b></center>
<p>Name: Terry Fawles
</p><p>Charge: Kidnapping, Murder<br/>
Sentence: Death Penalty
</p>
<center><b>Fugitive Movements</b></center>
<p>After escaping, Fawles met with, and then murdered, Sergeant Valerie Hawthorne, <i>[sic]</i> Recaptured on Eagle Mountain about 8 hours after his escape.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Her very first client was a death row inmate who had recently broken out of prison. That was a whole year before Mia and I ever met.

Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh... I'm so nervous. I feel like I'm going to die. I never should've accepted this case...)</span> Eeeeeeek! ...Ah! G-G-Good morning! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Don't be so jumpy, Mia!)</span>
</p><p>???:<br/>
I-I din't do nuttin'! I swear! I din't kill nobody!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Terry Fawles... ...My first client. Sentenced to death 5 years ago, and now... a prison escapee.)</span>
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Just relax, Mia! Make small talk and try to relax him!)</span> ...Err, umm... So why did you escape anyway?
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
Ah. Ah. UGGA!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Eeeeek! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
...Ugh. I din't do nuttin'! I din't kill nobody! I never... I never lie! I din't escape from nowhere!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Err... But, Mr. Fawles... The police just recaptured you two days ago.
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
... Ugh. Sorry. I told a little lie.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Oh boy...)</span>
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
But anyway, I din't do it! I never killed nobody!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Umm, sorry for asking but... You're on death row, right?
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
Uh. Uh... UGGA!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Eeeeeek! I'm really, really sorry!
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
They sentenced me to die 5 years ago! But I was tricked I tell you! That woman! She lied in her testimony! ...That's why I got the death penalty! I swear it! I din't kill her! I could never do that!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Two days ago, he escaped from the police wagon when it crashed... Then about 8 hours later... A policewoman was murdered before the police could recapture him. The police believe that Terry Fawles did it.)</span> Umm... After you escaped, did you meet a policewoman?
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
... Yeah... I did. ...She's the reason I escaped.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So that much is true... He did meet with the victim.)</span>
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
But I din't kill her! She was alive when I left! She was alive...! It-It's true!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I can trust him... right? I mean, I should...)</span>
</p><p>???:<br/>
Ha...! You're not going to figure out the truth by just staring at the guy...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Y-You're... Why are you here?
</p><p>???:<br/>
I came to see how our little kitten was doing all alone in the big, scary lion's den. ...I thought maybe you'd like someone to play with.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Err, where is Mr. Grossberg?
</p><p>???:<br/>
Ha...! That old man is probably still in bed. I bet he's clutching an empty bottle and mumbling in his sleep.
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Aren't I good enough? After all, it's me... Diego Armando!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
I-I didn't say... So, Diego Armando, the finest attorney at Grossberg Law Offices, is here for me...?
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
No, no, no... You've got it all wrong! Today, YOU'RE the finest! After all, it took an amazing amount of guts to take this case! Imagine... An escaped death row convict for a first client!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Yeah, err... Th-Thanks. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I sure wish I could get out of it though!)</span>
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Ha...! Relax. I just heard some good news. The prosecutor for today is fresh out of his diapers as well.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
R-Really!?
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
However... Unlike a certain somebody who I won't mention... ...he's earned the reputation as a "genius" since beginning his law career.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(G-Genius...?)</span>
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Well, it's about time to head in, Kitten. Sharpen those claws of yours. It's go time!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(A solitary confinement cell for the condemned must be the world's loneliest place. ...And that's what my client ran away from. Every other lawyer gave up on him... But not me. When I saw those overflowing eyes and heard that simple, child-like voice... I just had the feeling that he was telling the <span style="color:#E16935">truth</span>.)</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<center><span style="color:green">February 16, 10:00 AM<br/>District Court<br/>Courtroom No. 4</span></center>
<p><br/>
Judge:<br/>
Court is now in session for the trial of Terry Fawles.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>???:<br/>
The prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I understand the lawyers for both sides are newcomers...?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Y-Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm Mia Fey.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Miles Edgeworth... Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
So you're the new prosecutor everyone is talking about, eh? They say you joined the prosecutor's office at quite an early age.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
At 20... Your Honor.
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
I guess our little kitten hasn't earned herself much of a reputation yet, huh?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Come on, Mia! You can't lose! Not to someone younger than you!)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...Hmph.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Young people running a trial. I'm not too sure how I feel about that. ...Now then, the defendant in this case is currently a felon on death row. Two days ago, he escaped from a police wagon. Is that correct?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Precisely.
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
But the defendant is not on trial for escaping prison. On the day that the defendant escaped, a policewoman was murdered...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
So we're here to determine if Mr. Fawles was responsible for her death...?
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
You got it, Kitten.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well then, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's hear your opening statement.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Yes, Your Honor. It was five years ago. The defendant, Terry Fawles, was sentenced to death in this very court. His crimes were <span style="color:#E16935">kidnapping</span>, <span style="color:#E16935">extortion</span>... and <span style="color:#E16935">murder</span>. The girl he threw off the bridge was only 14 years old.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
A truly horrible crime. I remember it well. There was no decisive evidence, so the trial was long and protracted.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Correct. But in the end, what finally decided the case was... ...a certain <span style="color:#E16935">witness's testimony</span>.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
A witness's testimony...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The testimony of Detective Valerie Hawthorne; the person who confronted this criminal. She arrested Mr. Fawles at the scene and later testified against him. She said she witnessed Mr. Fawles throw his young victim into the river. For those who are not aware, Eagle River is well-known for its powerful current. Most bodies that fall in are never recovered...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So Ms. Hawthorne's testimony was the one that put him away...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
That policewoman you just mentioned... That wouldn't be...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Exactly. The victim. The same woman that was killed 2 days ago... Police Sergeant... Valerie Hawthorne.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Aha...! I see... The man who was sentenced to death based on her testimony escaped two days ago... ...with only one thing on his mind. To take revenge against the woman who convicted him. ... Hmm... Aha! The truth is becoming clear to me now!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Huh?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes, yes... It's quite obvious that the defendant is guilty.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>

</p><p>Mia:<br/>
W-Wait a minute! That's not right! At least hear the case before you decide on the outcome, Your Honor!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Grrrngh... Watch yourself, Ms. Fey! I'm not sure I care for your word choice, or your tone of voice.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Young people these days simply don't know how to respect their elders.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why you...! You're even younger than me, you hypocrite!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, please call your first witness.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I call the detective who was in charge of the initial investigation of this case.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Witness... State your name and occupation.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Gumshoe. Dick Gumshoe. I'm the homicide detective in charge of the case, sir! I finally got promoted to the detective division half a year ago!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
I don't believe anyone asked you about that.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Hey, ma'am! You got any idea how much work it takes... ......
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Wh-What is it?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
You... Y-You're really gorgeous...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Excuse me?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
No, seriously... My heart... It's aching for you...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Detective. Pull yourself together and try to be professional. Otherwise... I'll write you up on contempt so quick that something other than your heart will ache!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Urk... O-OK, I-I got it!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
...Now, Detective. Tell us about the incident.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yes, sir! Right away! The victim was Sergeant Valerie Hawthorne, a veteran on the police force. She was stabbed in the back with a knife and died from excessive blood loss.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
That much is already stated in the autopsy report. The court would like to hear more details about the incident itself.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yes, sir! I gotcha! OK! Let's take a look at this aerial map of the area here! This is a sketch of <span style="color:#E16935">Dusky Bridge</span>, an old suspension bridge. And the river that runs under there is Eagle River. The victim and the defendant met there... On top of the bridge. After stabbing her in the back, the killer carried the victim back to his car. He was recaptured at a police checkpoint as he was trying to make his getaway, sir.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... I see...
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Dusky Bridge Map added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Was the victim's blood found on the bridge?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
The victim, Sergeant Valerie Hawthorne, was wearing a thick coat, sir. Unfortunately, no traces of blood were found on the bridge.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... Mr. Edgeworth. I warn you that I absolutely despise conjecture. If there was no blood on the bridge, then you have no proof that they even met there!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Your Honor. If you would listen to the testimony we have prepared, I'm sure you'll be convinced. The two of them most certainly did meet on the bridge that day...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Why, Mr. Edgeworth... I'm not sure I like you wagging your finger at me as though I were some hoser! Detective, proceed with your testimony!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Um... Yes, sir!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Here we go, Mia! Hang on...!)</span>
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
OK now... Listen carefully, Kitten. One little mistake and this guy will drink you for morning tea! Trust me and get ready.
</p>
<hr/>
<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span></center>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- Summary of the Incident --</span></center>
<p>Gumshoe:<br/>
On the day of the incident, an unknown person phoned the sergeant and asked to meet.<br/>
Sergeant Hawthorne went to Dusky Bridge at the designated time and met with Mr. Fawles.<br/>
And that's where she was brutally murdered, sir.<br/>
The criminal stuffed her body into his car trunk and tried to make a getaway.<br/>
Mr. Fawles was arrested at a police checkpoint we set up at the base of the mountain.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... Well, you certainly have established the importance of the bridge.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...Naturally.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Now, would the defense please hurry up and proceed with the cross-examination.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Y-Yes, Your Honor! C-C-Cross-examination... Coming right up!
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Hey, hey! Settle down there, Kitten! If you keep trembling like that, you're gonna make me spill my coffee!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
I-I-I'm not t-trembling! It-It-It's just cold in here!
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
The courtroom can be a cold battlefield alright. Especially... for a beginner.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
I-I don't need you to worry about me...! I mean... I mean, the defendant, the witness... everyone's a beginner in here!
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Ha...! You got me there. But maybe you should keep your claws out, and show them what you've got... Kitten.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's OK, Mia. Stay calm... Just remember those court procedure videos you stayed up all last night watching!)</span>

Sergeant Hawthorne was a very thorough person, sir! She left a note about her phone call with Mr. Fawles.

</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What do you mean by that?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
If you remember, 5 years ago, the defendant kidnapped a young girl. He was chased onto a bridge... And it was there that he killed his hostage. And the place where all of this occurred is, of course, Dusky Bridge.

...!

Was the body of the victim discovered right away?

Yeah. We were really on the ball. We found the criminal within one hour of the murder. It was great! We even got to say, "Don't move! We've got you surrounded!"

The location was a suspension bridge, up in the mountains. So how did they find out about the crime so quickly...?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Sergeant Hawthorne must have mentioned the phone call to someone else, right?
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Ha...! If that's what had happened, then she wouldn't have been killed.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
She never mentioned the phone call from Mr. Fawles. But... She left a note on her desk about it. If only I had noticed it earlier... Maybe she'd still be alive.

Aaah... I, umm...!

I have one very simple question for you, Detective. Where is the white scarf? I can't seem to find it in this photo...

</p><p>Mia:<br/>
...Ah!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Wh-Where did you find that, sir!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
On Dusky Bridge. I was there first, and decided to conduct my own investigation.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Wh-Why...? Why didn't you tell me?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I made a decision to keep all pieces of evidence in my personal satchel. It's the safest place I know.
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Hmph! That hot-shot sure has a flair for the dramatic...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It's not exactly "white", as the caller requested... But as you can see, it's close enough, for what it was intended for.

Hmmm... It looks like it spent some time in the mud.

Not surprising... It was drizzling on the mountain that day.

Aha! A potential witness! So why isn't this person in the courtroom?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Well... They said they absolutely did not want to testify.

...The person in question is very delicate, Your Honor. Besides, as long as we have this photo, we see no reason to compel her to testify.

If the victim really did try to repel her killer and if she did fall down on the bridge... ...then you would expect her coat to be dirty. Therefore! The body that was found in the trunk of the car... It was NOT the body of Valerie Hawthorne!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Wh-What do you have to say to that, Mr. Edgeworth!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
*sigh* <span style="color:#E16935">Objection</span>.

Hmm... Not only a whisper, but he mixed in a sigh, too.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Valerie Hawthorne was more than a simple meter maid; she was a sergeant. There's absolutely no chance that a mistake about her identity could be made.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Uuurgh... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I guess he's right...)</span>

<p>Mia:<br/>
It is a no-brainer. Obviously it's the witness that's suspicious! During his earlier testimony, the detective pointed out a crucial fact. "The criminal <span style="color:#E16935">shoved the victim down from behind</span> and stabbed her in the back." Now, is that testimony exactly what the witness claims to have seen?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yeah. ...That's what the witness told us.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
That testimony... is filled with holes. After all, the victim's coat isn't dirty at all.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... That's true.
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Ha...! It's not just true. It's the truth. If there was a truly decisive witness in this case... ...I'm certain that boy wonder over there would have called them in the first place!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
...Your Honor! The defense requests to cross-examine the eyewitness! The testimony presented so far is not only vague, but contradictory as well!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well, Mr. Edgeworth? It appears that we'll need to hear from your mystery witness after all.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
... *sigh* You should brace yourself. ...For the brutal truth.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Your Honor, the prosecution has no intention of hiding the witness from the court. We are prepared to present our witness at any time.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well... Please bring forth your witness at this time.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>

</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hey, hey! Not so fast!)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...*sigh* As I said before... This witness is very sensitive and delicate. I would ask the court to please exercise care when addressing her.

Yes, indeed... Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. You are a true gentleman. Ms. Fey! You could learn a lot from this man!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>

</p><p>???:<br/>
Umm... Sir?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmmm... Eh? Yes, my dear?
</p><p>???:<br/>
This is my first time, so I'm sure I'll make a lot of mistakes. Anyway... I just wanted to say I'm sorry for all the trouble I might cause...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmmmmm... Not at all! It's no trouble at all!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Now then... May we please have your name and occupation?
</p><p>Melissa:<br/>
My name is, umm... ...Melissa Foster. I'm a college student... A-A freshman in the literature department.

You were on the scene when the unfortunate event occurred, correct?

I... I was using my camera to take some pictures of wild flowers.<br/>
Then, I noticed there were two people standing up on the suspension bridge.<br/>
Suddenly, they just started fighting!<br/>
That's when I hurried and took the photo that shows the crucial moment.<br/>
And right after that, I called the police.
</p>

<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... By the way, where were you standing when the incident occurred...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I believe the map would be of help here.
</p><p>Melissa:<br/>
Umm... I was standing right over... here. I was standing in a beautiful field, surrounded by tall cliffs.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
So you took the photo from that location, eh.
</p><p>Melissa:<br/>
I brought the camera I was using at the time, just like Mr. Edgeworth asked me to.

You called the police?
</p><p>Melissa:<br/>
Yes. Because it looked to me like the murderer was going to try to escape.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...We were already moving before the call even came in. Thanks to the victim's note, we had already started our operation.

Hmm... That was certainly tough luck for the criminal, eh.

</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You say there were... two contradictions!?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
It's simple. Just take a look at the diagram of the area. According to her testimony, the two of them were in the middle of the bridge. But if they were, and the victim had <span style="color:#E16935">turned around</span> and tried to run... Well, then...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
S-She would've hit a <span style="color:#E16935">dead-end</span>...!

Your Honor... Allow me to personally apologize for the confusion.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What do you mean?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
There's one <span style="color:#E16935">major mistake</span> in this diagram.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
What did you say!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What are you referring to?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It's all because this diagram was made <span style="color:#E16935">after the incident occurred</span>. It's a very old bridge... We couldn't find any official blueprints of it.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
S-So you're saying...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I'm saying that even though this bridge is currently in disrepair... ...there's no evidence that can prove that the bridge was broken during the incident.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Th-That's ridiculous...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
You can't actually tell the condition of the bridge from this photo... I apologize to the court for not being more clear when I presented the evidence.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm. Hmmmm...
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Ha...! That guy is good.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Huh? What do you mean?
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
He planned it from the beginning. He's a genius alright... That diagram of the bridge was his insurance policy.

No, no, no, no! It wasn't YOUR fault at all!

Now then... Shall we go on with the trial? I'd like to establish, once and for all, what it was that the witness actually saw.

Indeed. Alright, young lady... May I ask you to please proceed with your testimony?

A killer not wanting his victim to be found... I can understand that. However! The idea of moving the body for that purpose is clearly odd. There was a much easier way to make sure the body wasn't found!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
W-Well? What is it!?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Take another look at the map of the area and you'll see how. There's a river right below the bridge. Earlier Mr. Edgeworth pointed out something interesting about the river.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Edgeworth:<br/>
For those who are not aware, Eagle River is well-known for its powerful current. Most bodies that fall in are never recovered...
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Ahh...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
In the kidnapping case 5 years ago, the victim's body was carried away and never found.
</p><p>Melissa:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
If 10 murders were to occur at that same spot above the Eagle River... ...you can bet your boots that every other killer would have tossed the body in the water!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! Order! I'm not sure if I care for the way you put that, Ms. Fey! But I must admit it does seem odd not to have thrown the body into the river!
</p><p>Melissa:<br/>
Ooooh...!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well, Mr. Edgeworth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
*sigh* How sad. Perhaps Ms. Fey would do well to try taking a dip in the river herself. After all, you claim to be such an expert in the ways of nature...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
What are you talking about?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
My point is that no matter how odd you may find the killer's method of body-disposal... ...the fact is that this is what the killer did. None of your arguments have anything to do with what the witness saw.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... Quite true... Ms. Fey, it seems that your assertion is without merit after all.

Why do you say that? It's already a broken-down bridge hidden away in the mountains. Doing anything more to hide the corpse would be going overboard, wouldn't it?

Yes, but that mountain is famous among hikers. A surprising number of people go up there.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
But it's February, right? And it was raining that day, correct?
</p><p>Melissa:<br/>
There is also a small temple and a channeling dojo there. You know those monks... They just love cold, isolated places...

I think the witness is trying to say that the corpse could have been found at any time... Besides, the witness is merely reporting what she witnessed with her own eyes.

It's simple, Ms. Foster. Take a look at the diagram. The place you claim to have taken the photo from that day is here. Do you see what I mean? Even if you tried to see the car... ...this outcropping of rock is directly in the way.
</p><p>Melissa:<br/>
Ah...!

That's right, Ms. Foster. From where you were standing, you could not have possibly seen the killer's car.

Your Honor... Don't jump to any hasty conclusions. The fact that the escapee fled in a stolen car was reported on the news. After witnessing a murder, I'm sure you can appreciate that the witness was very upset. She must have heard about the stolen car and convinced herself that she saw it.

It true. I did... ...I did kidnap her. ...Five years ago. I kidnapped. My girlfriend. Dahlia Hawthorne.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Y-Your g-girlfriend? Huh...?
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Hey, hold on there! Did you say, "<span style="color:#E16935">Hawthorne</span>"!?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The victim's last name...!)</span>
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
Dahlia Hawthorne... Valerie's <span style="color:#E16935">little sister</span>.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Wh-Wh-Whaaat!? Are you serious!?
</p>
<hr/>
<p>The girl... Let her go!
</p><p>Shut up! C-Come closer... And I kill her!
</p><p>Sorry, but you're not going to get the chance...
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The detective back then was Valerie Hawthorne!)</span> At first I thought shooting someone for a kidnapping was crossing the line, but... If it was to protect her little sister, I can understand why she did it...
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
Wrong! No protect sister! Valerie betray me! Betray us!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
What do you mean she betrayed you!?
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
Everything. All lies. All make-believe. Kidnapping, too...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
A make-believe kidnapping?
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
Dahlia. My girlfriend. My love. My Teen Angel.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh. Did he actually say, "My Teen Angel"? He's seen one too many soap operas.)</span>
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
I do anything she says. Anything Dahlia says...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">("Anything Dahlia says"...?)</span> H-Hold on a minute! What you're saying is that the kidnapping 5 years ago was planned by...
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
Yeah. Me and Dahlia... ...And Valerie, too.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Valerie was in on it!?)</span>
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
Dahlia's family rich. Jewelry business. We get one jewel... That's what we thought... Me and Dahlia wrote kidnap note. We send to her dad. Asked for 2 million dollar diamond. Tell him make exchange on Dusky Bridge. ...We tell him Valerie make transfer 'cause she new detective.
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Having a police detective in your pocket is a useful thing alright. In the end, you were planning on splitting the 2 million three ways, huh...
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
Yeah, but! That woman! That woman! Valerie! She do it for real! She shoot at me for real! Me and Dahlia!
</p>
<hr/>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">*BANG!*</span></center>
<hr/>
<p>Fawles:<br/>
I was shot in arm. Dahlia... She jump in river.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#E16935">Jump</span>...? You don't mean she jumped on purpose, do you?
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
I couldn't do it! I could never push her...! Anyway, I blacked out... Wake up with police all over.
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
...And that's when they decided to give you the death sentence.
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
I couldn't believe it. That woman. She betrayed me.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Valerie:<br/>
That man... Terry Fawles... He killed her! He threw her off the bridge! He threw my beloved sister into the roaring river 40 feet below!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Fawles:<br/>
...These 5 years... All I wonder is... Why! ...Why! ...Why! ...Why! Why did she lie!? That's all I want to know!
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
So that's why you called her. You wanted to hear the truth from Valerie herself.
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
Yes... but I forget what she look like. So I tell her to wear scarf. I don't want to hurt her! ...Just ask why! Why! Why did you lie...? Why did you betray me...? I just want to hear answer come from her mouth. That's all!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So that's why... That's why you made a crazy escape like that...)</span>
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Just one thing, Zebra Boy... My senses are tingling all over. Tell me, Mr. Fawles... Where is it?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
...Huh? Where's what?
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Come on now, Kitten... The ransom. The <span style="color:#E16935">2 million dollar diamond</span>. Remember that now? Did you give it back to Pops? Did the police take it?
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
...I dunno.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Huh? You don't know?
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
No really. I dunno. It's gone. With Dahlia.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
...With Dahlia?
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
That day. On the bridge... Dahlia put it. In backpack... Now gone. With Dahlia. Gone... Forever... Into Eagle River...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It <span style="color:#E16935">disappeared</span> with Dahlia, huh...? Wait a minute...!)</span>
</p><p>Bailiff:<br/>
...You can come back in now! We're about ready to go!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Mr. Fawles! Just one more question! When you said, "<span style="color:#E16935">with Dahlia</span>", do you mean the diamond is still missing...? Along with the body of Dahlia Hawthorne?
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
... Never found her... My sweet Dahlia...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(They never found her...!)</span>
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
Swallowed by river... Gone... Dahlia... My Teen Angel...
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Your "Teen Angel"...? How old was she anyway?
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
Just 14...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
F-F-Fourteen!? <span style="color:#0070C0">(I guess you were robbing cradles before diamonds...)</span>
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
She plans a fake kidnapping and disappears into the river with a rock worth 2 mil... Man oh man... Angels these days.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Fawles takes the fall... And gets a one-way ticket to Death Row... Is Dahlia Hawthorne an angel or is she really a...)</span>
</p><p>Armando:<br/>

Now then, let's continue with the trial of Mr. Terry Fawles. ...Witness. Are you feeling better?
</p><p>Melissa:<br/>
Y-Yes, Your Honor... I-I'll try my best.

Hmm... You're a brave young lady.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Not this again...)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I can understand a defense lawyer wanting to get her client off the hook... However! To try to pin the crime on an innocent student is...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
What are you talking about!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
My witness is not the person on trial here. She's an innocent bystander who witnessed a violent crime. ...That's all. What possible reason would a girl like this have for murdering a policewoman!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... It's certainly hard to imagine this woman as a murderer...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Her <span style="color:#E16935">motive</span>, huh... I figured that's what I had to establish next...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well, Ms. Fey? Do you have any evidence of a motive?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
... Err, yes! Of course! ...I think.
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Hah...! You're still acting as tame as a kitten... Kitten.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Mr. Armando...
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Listen... A lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Smiling on the outside while your guts are twisted in knots is the mark of a pro.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
...Maybe so, but I wish you would quit grinning at me like that.
</p><p>Melissa:<br/>
Umm... Excuse me... May I speak, Mr. Judge?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Of course! Mr. Judge is ready anytime you like!
</p><p>Melissa:<br/>
I'd like... I'd like to say something. Some people here are suspicious of me, right? Th-That's why... I... I at least wanted you, Mr. Judge, to know that it's not true...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmmmmm! I see! You're such an honest and upstanding young lady.
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
It looks like this witness is a real professional.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>

Precisely. Furthermore, she has no possible motive for committing murder.

Your Honor. I have an admission to make. I honestly never thought the defense would pursue the matter this far...

You don't...! You don't mean...!

...Yes. The prosecutor's office isn't filled with fools, you know. Naturally, we conduct full background checks on all of our witnesses.

Wh-What did he say...?

Ha...! It looks like the kid knew. He knew her true identity from the get-go.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
No way...! But then why...!
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
If you hadn't revealed her secret, he wasn't going to say anything about it. All he wanted was her testimony, so he made a little trade.

</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Why!? Why did she hide her identity for 5 years!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
That has nothing to do with the current case. She was merely an accidental witness to a crime...

<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- 5 Years Ago --</span></center>
<p>Dahlia:<br/>
Five years ago, I was kidnapped by Mr. Fawles.<br/>
The ransom price was a raw diamond. My sister, Valerie, brought it to the bridge...<br/>
After she made the exchange, she shot Mr. Fawles in the arm!<br/>
That's when Mr. Fawles tried to kill me by shoving me off the bridge from behind!<br/>
I survived, but I was afraid I might be kidnapped again for my family's money...<br/>
So I decided to change my identity and start a new life...<br/>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmmm...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...The kidnapping left her emotionally scarred. With her sister's help, she left the Hawthorne family and started all over again. And we're to believe after all that, she murdered her sister? Preposterous!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. ...Ms. Fey?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Y-Yes, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
As you've heard, the witness is still traumatized from the kidnapping. ...I'll ask you again to be extremely gentle in your cross-examination.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Mr. Edgeworth got the jump on me again...)</span>
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Ha...! If we're not allowed to fight, then let's twist some arms. ...Listen up. We've still got that info... That ace up our sleeve.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
...What info?
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Come on, Kitten. Don't say you've forgotten already. The fact that the kidnapping 5 years ago was staged!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's right, it was a <span style="color:#E16935">fake kidnapping</span>! Terry Fawles told us that in the lobby.)</span>

<p>Fawles:<br/>
I do anything she says. Anything Dahlia says...
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Mia:<br/>
What you're saying is that the kidnapping 5 years ago was planned by...
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
Yeah. Me and Dahlia... ...And Valerie, too.

<p>Mia:<br/>

I heard the diamond is valued in the neighboorhood <i>[sic]</i> of 2 million dollars.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
2 million dollars!?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br/>
It was still uncut, so it was about the size of a pint of milk.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
HMMMMM!!! A 2 million dollar pint of milk... I don't know what to think about that!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The defendant demanded that her sister, Valerie, make the exchange. Not as a detective, of course, but as an individual.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
By the way, I want to ask you, Mr. Edgeworth. Why do you think he wanted to make the exchange up there on that mountain? If he ever got surrounded, it would be hard to escape...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
There's one thing a kidnapper wants to prevent, and that's police involvement. In a place like that, it would be easy to tell if he was being followed. With only one entrance to the mountain, he was ensuring his safety.
</p><p>Dahlia:<br/>
What a wickedly clever man that Mr. Fawles is...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yeah, right. It was all YOUR plan...)</span>

Well, when Mr. Fawles was shot in the right arm, he let go of me... I-I was dazed. I turned to try and run away, but Mr. Fawles turned to grab me as well... As I ran past, he and I locked eyes for a second, and he gave me a large, bloodthirsty grin.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
B-Bloodthirsty grin... Oooh...
</p><p>Dahlia:<br/>
And in the next instant...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I advise the court to remember that the river is 18 feet deep and incredibly swift...
</p><p>Dahlia:<br/>
I-I was a strong swimmer, but I was knocked out... When I came to, I had been carried away by the river to a strange place. I'll never forget that day. The crumbling bridge, nowhere to run... Then just one little shove from behind. That was it. Before my sister could catch me... ...I fell into the river.

</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What do you mean by that?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
On the day of the murder... ...after receiving the phone call from Mr. Fawles, Valerie called her sister, Dahlia. And then she told her what she was planning to do.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
"Planning to do"...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
She was going to tell the whole truth... As she wrote in her note!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
THAT is what sealed Valerie Hawthorne's fate... THAT is when you hatched your demonic plan to kill two birds with one stone. A plan that would ensure neither of your accomplices to the kidnapping would talk. And THAT is why... ...you killed your sister, Valerie Hawthorne!
</p><p>... Hee hee...

You can certainly weave an exciting tale... Naturally... you have the evidence to back it up, don't you?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Ev-Evidence...?
</p><p>Dahlia:<br/>
Evidence that I planned the kidnapping, of course... That at 14, I plotted it with Mr. Fawles and my sister.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
W-Well, I...
</p><p>Dahlia:<br/>
And one more thing. What happened to the 2 million dollar diamond? If you can't provide evidence to at least show that...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmmmmm... Well, Ms. Fey?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
I... I don't know...
</p><p>Dahlia:<br/>
What a joke. YOU, MS. FEY... Are you stupid or something?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Nnrgh...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(How can I prove a fake kidnapping that happened 5 years ago!? I don't even have decisive proof of Valerie Hawthorne's murder...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well it seems... that we've come to the end. To be honest, the witness's behavior does raise certain suspicions... However, I am forced to reject the assertions made by the defense.
</p><p>Dahlia:<br/>
Of course you are.

</p><p>Mia:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(T-Testimony...?)</span>
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
On the day in question, Dahlia Hawthorne murdered her sister, Valerie Hawthorne. She hid her body in the trunk of Mr. Fawles's stolen car and then went to meet with him... ...disguised as her sister, Valerie Hawthorne. That's what you think, right?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Y-Yes, that's right...

In that case, there's only one answer, right? There is only one <span style="color:#E16935">person</span> left who can <span style="color:#E16935">testify</span> about Valerie Hawthorne's murder!

I'm sure he is. Zebra Boy waited 5 years to ask a single question... To find out why a woman betrayed him. To him, 30 minutes must've been like a blink of the eye.

B-But that's the <span style="color:#E16935">victim</span> at the end of the bridge!

Precisely my point. In other words, Mr. Fawles... You must have arrived at the bridge <span style="color:#E16935">after</span> she did.
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
Nng... Urkkk... Ahhh... Ggggaah... Blah...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>

...!

I... I had somewhere to go. A special place...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Did you go to this special place before you went to the bridge?
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
Yeah... It's an old temple about 15 minutes from the bridge. Five years ago, me and Dahlia... We promised each other... We swore we wouldn't betray each other... She brought a <span style="color:#E16935">memento</span>... To represent... our love.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
A memento...?
</p><p>Fawles:<br/>
Five years ago, I hid it under base of tree there. It's a special memory for me. This is it... This is what I went to get.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
This little bottle on a necklace is your memento? It's quite charming... but it looks empty.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Your Honor! You heard what my client said. He arrived at the scene at 4 o'clock. But he then left his car unattended and walked away! He was gone for approximately 30 minutes!

And so my first trial ended... Suddenly, and tragically. It ended with no winners... Only losers. I ended up with a wound that cut so deep into my soul, I thought it'd never heal. I'm sure it was the same for the young prosecutor as well. But one person... The true criminal, Dahlia Hawthorne... She left the courtroom with a secret smile on her demonically sweet face.

<p>Armando:<br/>
Unforgivable... That witch...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
M-Mr. Armando...
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
We were so close to the truth. It was right there in front of us. You were just a little too soft, Kitten...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
It's my fault! It's all my fault that Mr. Fawles killed himself!
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Don't cry, Kitten. You're going to make my coffee all salty.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
I-I knew it...! I kn-knew I wasn't cut out for this...!
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
............... Mia...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Armando:<br/>
Don't you get it? You can't cry yet. The only time a lawyer can cry is when it's all over.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
M-Mr. Armando...
</p>
<hr/>
<p>No matter how tough the case... No matter how bitter the memories... ...they always fade over time. Then you file them away and eventually forget them... One year later, in this very same courthouse... I, myself, got wrapped up in "that case". Only after that, did Dahlia Hawthorne get put on trial for her crimes. The verdict that was ultimately handed down to her was... "<span style="color:#E16935">Guilty</span>", of course. Naturally, when the verdict was read, she had a perfect, angelic smile on her face. It was finally all over. At least, that's what I thought at the time. Unfortunately... I couldn't have been more wrong... It's been 5 years, but now something has happened that's made me remember all this.

Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I'm sorry, but... I think the only thing out of place here is that pointer finger of yours.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
... That could very well be...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Here, take this penalty and try thinking things through again.

This evidence establishes that the defendant is lying, right?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Don't ask me to confirm your facts!

S-Sorry... This is my first time handling a case...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well, let's make it a memorable occasion... with a penalty.

That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Terry Fawles...

That is all. This court is adjourned!
