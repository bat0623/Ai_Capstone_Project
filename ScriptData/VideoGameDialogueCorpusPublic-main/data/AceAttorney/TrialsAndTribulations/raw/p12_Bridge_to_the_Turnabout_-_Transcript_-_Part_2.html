Iris:<br/>
Oh my... Mr. Laurice feels that way about... me...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Apparently... he isn't aware of your real secret at all.
</p><p>Iris:<br/>
... ......
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
This is no time to be embarrassed!
</p><p>Iris:<br/>
I-I'm sorry! I'm just... hardly accustomed to that sort of thing.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Worry not... And in any case, whatever it was that he saw on the night of the incident... Mark my words, I will drag it out him!
</p><p>Iris:<br/>
Does that mean... Mr. Laurice is the witness today...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...No. I believe that nun... will be the first to take the stand.
</p><p>Iris:<br/>
Sister Bikini...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
She claims to have seen the very instant in which you carried out the crime.
</p><p>Iris:<br/>
...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I just want to ask you one last time. It really wasn't you who killed Ms. Elise Deauxnim, correct?
</p><p>Iris:<br/>
... That is correct. It wasn't me.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...Very well, then.
</p><p>Iris:<br/>
Um... Mr. Edgeworth?

Judge:<br/>
Court is now in session for the trial of Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
...The defense does indeed appear to be ready... However, the same cannot be said for the prosecution in this case.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...Indeed.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I'm not sure I like such blatant waste of this court's time. An empty prosecutor's chair can only mean... ...that the prosecutor has no confidence in their ability to prove their case. It would seem this case is already over before it had a chance to begin. I am ready to announce my verdict at this time. This court finds the defendant...

The prosecution... stands ready.

A-And you are...?

Franziska von Karma... Prosecuting prodigy.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
V-Von Karma, you say...? Perchance, you wouldn't be of any relation to the legendary prosecutor Manfred von Karma?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
... Legends are a thing of the past. I am a Von Karma. That is all. Upon a special request, I flew in today for the purposes of prosecuting this case.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Y-You did!? Then... you must be quite a big shot, eh! By the way, Mr. Edgeworth...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Yes, Your Honor?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I'm almost certain that I've seen you somewhere before. Or am I just imagining things? You look very much like a prosecutor I met once...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...I believe you are imagining things, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Ms. von Karma? Do you have anything to say?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
... There is no such weakling as this man among those of the Prosecutor's Office.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
There... there isn't...? But I'm sure... once before, in this courtroom... Ack!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...I told you, there is no such weakling!

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...I have no objection to the whip.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Y-You don't...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The prosecution can wield a whip or drink seventeen cups of coffee... But there is still only one truth. That is what I stand here to prove today!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
This promises to be interesting... Miles Edgeworth. ...I had expected to face Phoenix Wright here today. But looking at you now... ...maybe this is what I have been waiting for all this time. Miles Edgeworth! I will not allow this chance to crush you slip through my fingers!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...I see you brought your flair for the histrionic.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Allow me to add to the things I'm not sure about... People acting bizarrely in my court! Uwa-hah!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...The stage is set. Now continue with the proceedings, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well. Ms. von Karma, please give an outline of this case. With as little whipping as possible!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
The murder victim is the famed picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her body was found in the Hazakura Temple courtyard. She had been stabbed through the torso by a ceremonial sword from a golden statue.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The sword in this picture... is the weapon in question, correct...? ...Very well. The court accepts this photo of the crime scene.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Crime Photo added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
There is no mistake. This was the doing of Sister Iris. After all... there is a <span style="color:#E16935">witness</span> to her crime.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
...Very well. Please bring this witness to the stand!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(And so it begins... My first and my last trial... as a defense attorney!)</span>

Little old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Y-You want me to leave!?
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
No need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
In any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question.
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
That's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Let us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh!

<p>Bikini:<br/>
That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...<br/>
Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.<br/>
So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.<br/>
There's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.<br/>
It was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple?
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...)</span>
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
There is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth?

What is this Inner Temple...?
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
Well, see, conversing with the spirits is what we train people to do, right?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
We'll be the ones asking you the questions, madam.
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
...In order to do that, a place strong in spiritual power is required. There's a small temple across Dusky Bridge, called the Inner Temple.  Acolytes must spend an entire night there to undergo intense training.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
And how exactly do you help with this process...?
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
It is all quite exacting. It can't be performed without a nun supervising.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Like a tutor, watching to make sure a spoiled child studies.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>

In that case, Ms. Honcho... I'd like you to explain something for me. The discrepancy between your testimony and that of the defendant, Iris. She claims that after ringing the lights out bell, she went back and stayed in her room. ...Which means! She did not go to the Inner Temple at all!

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
But that is completely illogical. The murder was committed in the courtyard of Hazakura Temple. Claiming that she "<span style="color:#E16935">went to the Inner Temple</span>" would make for a much better alibi.

It's just like I told you earlier... "I heard a noise from the courtyard." OK? "Thump"... Just like that.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
You're one smart sister, I'll give you that. The autopsy report states that... ...the victim's body was covered in <span style="color:#E16935">bruises</span>... ...indicating a <span style="color:#E16935">fall</span> from around 10 feet in height.

T-The autopsy report...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The victim did fall from a height of 10 feet. ...However. This fall... was <span style="color:#E16935">after</span> she was killed.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Ah...!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
T-That's right! It says "after death" right here!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The scene the witness claims to have seen is contradictory! If the defendant stabbed and killed the victim there in the courtyard... ...how did the victim then go on to take a ten foot fall!?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Aaah!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
O-Order! Order! The victim was killed and then fell! If that is the case... ...then the victim must have been killed in <span style="color:#E16935">her room</span>... Don't you agree?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Th-That is the logical conclusion... Yes, that's right! The victim must have been stabbed by the defendant in her own room! And she was then thrown out of her window down into the courtyard below!

Were there any signs of a struggle in Ms. Deauxnim's room...?

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
She was stabbed with a sword! That would leave a blood stain, wouldn't you agree?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
W-Well, Ms. von Karma? Was there any blood...? Waaaaaah!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...No traces of blood were found in the victim's room.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
...Your whip has just caused traces of blood to be found on my glorious playoff beard. However! If there was no blood in the room, then your claim that... Waaaaah!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
I'm sure there's no need for me to go over this... ...as I'm sure Your Honor is well aware... ...of when a stab wound produces the most blood.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
When it produces the most blood...?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Very little blood is actually lost at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be <span style="color:#E16935">when the blade is removed</span>.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Indeed. With the weapon still in place... ...it acts like a <span style="color:#E16935">lid</span> on the wound.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
That's true... With the weapon still in the body, there wouldn't be much bleeding... A perfectly reasonable line of thinking!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
We have come to a conclusion then! The victim was thrown out of the window with the sword still in place... This removes all of the contradictions!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! Order! I must admit that this is a probable version of events!

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
By "Mystic Ami", you are referring to the golden statue, correct?
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
Just stabbing someone with the Shichishito, a sacred treasure, is terrible enough.
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
But to then make Mystic Ami hold the blade...!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Truly, a heinous, despicable crime.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It is easy to despise something. Anyone can do it. However, there is something that cannot be done so easily...
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Whatever it is, I'm sure it's doubly hard for you. Anyway, what is the problem?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Exactly why would the killer set up this gruesome scene? Can anyone explain the reasoning behind that?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmmmmm... No, I don't think I can.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
... There isn't always a logical reason behind why someone acts!
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
That's true, so true. In early spring, for example, I often find myself...

<span style="color:#0070C0">(There are too many unnatural elements in this case... Why was it necessary to use the Shichishito from the Ami statue as a weapon? Why was the weapon finally placed back in the hand of the statue? If I can expose the flaws in this testimony, perhaps then I will begin to find the truth.)</span>

<p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Sister Bikini. You are a reliable witness... At least, I'd like to think so. But there are too many contradictions here.
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
W-What do you mean? You make it sound as though I'm a liar! But... You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
What contradictions are you talking about?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
In the scene that the witness claims to have seen... ...the weapon was thrust up to its <span style="color:#E16935">hilt</span> into the victim. Furthermore... the killer withdrew the weapon <span style="color:#E16935">smoothly</span> from the body. ...However! Both of these are complete impossibilities!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What do you mean...? Please, explain you... Uwaaaaah!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Explain yourself!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
To start with... Do you think it would be possible to stab someone to the hilt with this? No matter how I look at the defendant, she doesn't appear strong enough for that.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>

"Doesn't appear"...? What meaningless dribble! I, too, may appear to be weak and frail... But I can crush men under my heel and make them weep, should I so choose!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The objection stands! I wept a little back there, I must admit.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...That isn't the only issue here. If this sword was truly stabbed into the body up to the hilt... Well, just look at all the branches on it. It certainly wouldn't come out smoothly.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
T-That's...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
We also have the problem of the amount of bleeding. It's true that when a blade is left in a body, it acts as a "plug" of sorts. However! When the weapon is shaped like this, it's an entirely different story. The wound would be too large for the blade to completely stop from bleeding!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
<span class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:File"><a class="mw-file-description image" href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445"><img class="mw-file-element lazyload" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" decoding="async" height="192" loading="lazy" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" width="260"/></a></span>
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
T-That's nothing more than conjecture! In reality, the victim was stabbed with the Shichishito. Even a weapon of this nature... ...may still sometimes slide out smoothly, and may still sometimes stop the blood loss!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
<span class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:File"><a class="mw-file-description image" href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445"><img class="mw-file-element lazyload" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" decoding="async" height="192" loading="lazy" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" width="260"/></a></span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I'm not finished. There is still one more... <span style="color:#E16935">conclusive contradiction</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Y-You've still got more!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...This one is simple. If this sword really was thrust in all the way to the <span style="color:#E16935">hilt</span>... ...why is there only blood on the <span style="color:#E16935">tip</span> of it?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Ah...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
If this witness is telling the truth... Then there should be blood along the <span style="color:#E16935">entire length</span> of the sword!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Noooooo!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! Ord-- Whaaaaaaaa!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Bravo... Miles Edgeworth. Raising this many contradictions from a single piece of evidence! All the other attorneys I know could maybe manage one, if that!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
But what does this all mean!? You have proven contradictions regarding the murder weapon, but...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...Having come this far, there can only be one answer.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
And that is...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The weapon used to kill the victim... ...was not the Shichishito!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
W-Whaaaaaaaaat!?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
A foolishly foolish idea born from the foolish mind of a foolhardy foolish fool.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Let's examine this again. What was it that made us think this sword was the murder weapon?
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
W-Well... It's because Mystic Ami was holding it...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...Exactly. However! If you reflect on this, that is the only basis we have to assume such a thing. The impression left by the scene was just too strong. That is what influenced us. It influenced us to believe that the Shichishito was the <span style="color:#E16935">murder weapon</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! Order! Waaaaaaaaah!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
So maybe the Shichishito was not the murder weapon. Even if that is the case... it changes nothing, Miles Edgeworth! The Sister here saw everything! She saw the defendant stab the victim with a <span style="color:#E16935">sword-like object</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmmmmmm... That's true! Your response, Mr. Edgeworth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
... If that is so... I would like the prosecution to answer the obvious question it raises.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The obvious... question?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...Yes. Namely... Where did the <span style="color:#E16935">real murder weapon</span> disappear to?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It goes without saying that the police searched the Main Hall and the surrounding area. ...Perhaps the prosecution can enlighten us as to if a "sword-like object" was found.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
T-That's...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Answer the question, Ms. von Karma!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
... No evidence of that kind was found.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmmmmm... Another mystery to throw onto the pile! A trial without a murder weapon is a tricky beast!
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
Excuse me... Could I say something...? I just remembered something, actually...
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...What is it, Sister?
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
I was just thinking... It's possible... ...that just maybe... what actually happened was... it was just over there...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
... What exactly are you going on aboot here?
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
The murder weapon, I mean! Maybe... I think I might know where the sword was disposed of!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
You what!?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Well then... I think we need to hear testimony from you one more time, Sister.

<p>Bikini:<br/>
I saw the murder at around 11 PM...<br/>
And after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate.<br/>
And there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the <span style="color:#E16935">snowmobile</span> had been used!<br/>
It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!<br/>
Maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?<br/>
...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmmmmmm... Witness. Please, tell us everything you know right away next time.
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
Well. I'm not in the best of shape. What with my back and my age, you know.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Quite... There were indeed snowmobile tracks in front of the Main Gate. Here is a photograph.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
A snowmobile, eh... I see. Well, it certainly is an interesting theory...
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
The tracks begin in front of Hazakura Temple... ...and run all the way to Dusky Bridge!
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Tracks Photo added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...That solves your pesky little problem, yes? The Eagle River's current is quite swift, meaning that it doesn't freeze over in winter. Making it the perfect place to dispose of the murder weapon!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Did she really go to the river to dispose of the murder weapon...?)</span>

Yes... I was worried about it, after all.

Why was that?
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
Because I have a strong sense of responsibility. Especially at this time of year. The acolyte was being doused in freezing water at the time... I couldn't very well take it easy in the bath all night now, could I? So at 11, I decided to leave Hazakura Temple.

I admit this photograph proves something. It proves that the snowmobile was used on the night of the murder.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
You've finally accepted the inevitable, it seems... Miles Edgeworth.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>

</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
What do you mean...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Iris left Hazakura Temple, threw the weapon into the river, and then returned. If this was the case, then naturally there should be <span style="color:#E16935">two</span> sets of tracks in the snow! Those from heading out to the bridge, and those from coming back.
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
... Ah...! You're right!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Hmph... You are forgetting one thing, Miles Edgeworth.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
On the night of the murder, it was snowing. The tracks leading to the bridge were <span style="color:#E16935">erased by the snowfall</span>. This removes your precious contradiction, now doesn't it!

"On the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge..."
</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Ultimately, it all comes down to one point. That being... Whether or not it was snowing in that <span style="color:#E16935">courtyard</span> when the victim was stabbed...
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
That's right. But proving that is...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Incredibly easy.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
If we want to know whether it was snowing or not, this photo will tell us everything. Of course, I am referring to the photo of the crime scene. As you can see... everything is covered with snow. ...With just <span style="color:#E16935">one exception</span>.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
And that is...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The victim herself, <span style="color:#E16935">Ms. Elise Deauxnim</span>! Why is there no snow on top of her...? The answer is simple! It had stopped snowing when she was killed, that's why!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Gnnngh!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
In other words! If the killer really did go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon... ...then in this photograph, there should be two sets of tracks!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Aaaaah!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! Just what are you... Gyahaah!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
J-Just what are you suggesting, Miles Edgeworth!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(To be honest... I am not entirely sure myself. But...)</span> This is simply what all of the facts point to. That night... someone used the snowmobile to leave Hazakura Temple. From the tracks left, it can be understood that they were heading for Dusky Bridge. At that time... it was still snowing. 
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
<span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [Of course it was. Because those tracks were gone.] in the original release">Of course it was. Because those tracks were erased by the snow.</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [Of course it was. Because those tracks were gone.] in the original release)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Then when this person returned to Hazakura Temple... ...the snow had stopped. Thus, the return tracks remained.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmmmmm...
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
Can I say something? This all sounds a bit fishy to me...
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...What does, Sister?
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
There is only one key for the snowmobile.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Furthermore, on the night in question, we know that the defendant had it! The key was found in her room after the murder!
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
...Which can only mean, that night... Iris used the snowmobile to go to the <span style="color:#E16935">Inner Temple</span>...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(But... Iris said that she <span style="color:#E16935">never went there</span>... I should probably press on this point some more when I get the chance...)</span>
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
The snowmobile can't cross the suspension bridge... So, she must have left it on the Hazakura side of the bridge and crossed on foot.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
...That sounds right.
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
But... What's odd is, when I left Iris and returned to Hazakura Temple... I <span style="color:#E16935">didn't see anything</span> near Dusky Bridge.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Y-You must have just failed to see it, Sister.
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
Maybe... But when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean. I know what I saw. It was covered in snow, too...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
B-But that... isn't possible!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! Order in the court! ...What does this all mean?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...Nngh...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
So then what was the snowmobile used for...? It wasn't taken by the defendant when she went to the Inner Temple. If it had been, then the witness <span style="color:#E16935">couldn't possibly have seen it by the gate</span>. Furthermore... it wasn't used by the killer to dispose of the murder weapon. If that was the case, there should be <span style="color:#E16935">two</span> sets of tracks in this photo. All we know is this... After it stopped snowing... someone used the snowmobile to return to Hazakura Temple!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>

First... that he saw "<span style="color:#E16935">something incredible</span>" on the night of the murder.

This is Larry Butz... The student of the victim, Elise Deauxnim.

Her student...? Interesting. Why was he wandering on the night of the murder?

T-That's... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I could tell them all about his designs for Iris... But it may cost us his credibility as a witness...

And so...? This unfortunate, unreliable-looking man... What exactly was it that he saw?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I intend to extract that from him, right here in this courtroom.

Iris:<br/>
Excuse me... Mr. Edgeworth? I'm not really sure what to say...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Iris. We only have 20 minutes. There are two things which I need to ask you before we reconvene.
</p><p>Iris:<br/>
...Alright. I'll help you any way I can.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
First, about that night. You really didn't go to the Inner Temple, correct? The last witness claims to have met and talked with you in the Training Hall. Either you or Sister Bikini... ...is lying.
</p><p>Iris:<br/>
... Mr. Edgeworth. It is just as I said yesterday. Until the incident occurred... I was in my own room, in Hazakura Temple.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...Very well. The second thing, then. That night, the temple snowmobile was used in between the time Sister Bikini... ...returned to the Main Hall and when she bore witness to the murder. Sometime between 10:30 and 11 PM that night. Were you the one who used the snowmobile?
</p><p>Iris:<br/>
... There is only one key for the snowmobile. The only person who could have used it... was me.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
So it was you...! But... why? ...What made you go out to Dusky Bridge?
</p><p>Iris:<br/>
... I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth.
</p>

Iris...

I can't... tell you about that... yet.

"<span style="color:#E16935">Yet</span>"...?
</p><p>Iris:<br/>
Not until her safety is confirmed...

... No matter who or what may come... I could never take a life.

... <span style="color:#0070C0">(As I thought... no <span style="color:#E16935">Psycholocks</span>...)</span> ...Very well. It is my job to get to the truth. You'll discover this for yourself soon enough.

...Court will now reconvene. Ms. von Karma. Where is the witness...?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
During the break, a man was detained for suspicious behavior in the gallery.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Suspicious behavior...?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
He was sketching something... Very intensely.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Dare I ask what the witness was sketching when he was detained?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
He drew a terrifying woman, armed with a demonic face and a vicious whip.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
... I can only presume that his intention was to capture you-- ...Aaaah!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Anyway, it's time to drag this pathetic excuse for an artist before the court! Laurice Deauxnim! I hope you're ready... Get in here!

You tried to run away from the bailiff who was trying to hand you your subpoena, correct?
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
L-Look! I'm nothing but a fledgling artist, training out in the mountains! I'm only down here in the city because I ran out of green paint. Well, to use the technical term for the color, "viridian".
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...Larry... This isn't an art store, now is it...?
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
I know! I graduated junior high, OK!? Look. Art is all about working in the fields, isn't it?

Working in the fields...?

</p><p>Judge:<br/>
It certainly doesn't sound that way to me.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
However... I cannot forgive you for simply turning away from the incidents you create!
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
Waaah... You're totally pinning this on me...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...Now then. Let us talk about the night of the murder. Sister Bikini, after seeing the murder take place, asked Phoenix Wright to report it. Thus, he headed for the public phone by the bridge... There, he happened across <span style="color:#E16935">a certain nefarious individual</span>! You, Larry Butz!
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
... That's right. Me, in the flesh.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... Listen carefully, witness. It doesn't matter if you change your name. So long as you remain pretty pathetic, you will continue to cause these incidents! That reality will not change!
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
B-But...! What do you want me to do, then!?

I went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM...<br/>
I was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me!<br/>
I looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire!<br/>
There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out.<br/>
That's when I ran into Nick.

<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmmmm... You certainly saw quite a lot, didn't you?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
So... what happened to the bridge after it caught on fire?
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
It was like me after a three-day stint chasing a girl... It totally burnt out. Like, almost totally gone. ...I mean, trying to cross the burning remains was what caused Nick to fall.

Hmmmmm... "Excited"? Dare I even ask...?
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
I set the meeting time as <span style="color:#E16935">10:00 PM</span>, right? But I couldn't wait. And I thought she might come early, too.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...Well, it appears she didn't come at all, in the end.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Because they never arranged to meet in the first place, did they?
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
Shut up! Don't go picking my fond memories apart! Anyway, I was getting a little worried. I thought maybe Iris had lost her way. So every twenty minutes or so, I went out to the bridge. But I didn't see anything particularly suspicious... I didn't have anything else to do, so I went back to the shack to wait for her.

Your very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not...

But your testimony is conclusively contradictory. The problem here... is <span style="color:#E16935">time</span>.
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
I've never been the best timekeeper, you know. "Three minutes after Billy leaves on foot, you follow him on your bicycle. How long does it take for you to catch up with him?" Terrible at those.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...This is much more simple. You saw the lightning strike Dusky Bridge... ...and immediately went to see what had happened. ...Is this correct?
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
Yeah... Well, I wasted about five minutes first, but more or less.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...I have the weather data from the night of the murder here. According to this, the lightning fell at <span style="color:#E16935">10:45 PM</span>. You say it takes <span style="color:#E16935">less than five minutes</span> from the shack to Dusky Bridge. Meaning you probably got there at around <span style="color:#E16935">11 PM</span>.
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
...That all sounds about right, I guess. And then Nick showed up and did his falling act.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
That is impossible.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...What do you mean?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
11 PM is <span style="color:#E16935">when the murder occurred</span> in Hazakura Temple. Thus... Wright was still there, in the <span style="color:#E16935">courtyard</span>. There is no way that Larry could have encountered him at Dusky Bridge at that time!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
Ah! Excuse me! I-I have an <span style="color:#E16935">objection</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You do?
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
Edgey! How many times do I have to say this!? I'm not Larry! I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Gyaaah!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...It has not been proven that the murder occurred at 11 PM. The Sister only said, "around 11". ...In which case! It could have been earlier than that!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...Watch your footing there, Ms. Franziska von Karma. The slope ahead is slippery! For there is still no way that Wright could have been at Dusky Bridge at 11 PM!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
And why not!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It is clearly written here in the weather data report. It took <span style="color:#E16935">around 30 minutes</span> for the bridge to burn out. Therefore! The bridge must have been burning until at least <span style="color:#E16935">11:15 PM</span>!

...Just as I thought, you've been playing with us all this time.

Listen... I'm... I'm going to tell you everything! Are you sure you want to hear it all!?

Y-Yes...

I may reeeeally say it this time! Everything! Kahaah!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>

</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well... I have a terribly bad feeling aboot this; however... ...let's have the witness finally give us the whole truth. Now... for this 15 minute gap, what where you doing, witness!?

<p>Butz:<br/>
I'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing?<br/>
Sketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art!<br/>
The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page!<br/>

<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Including the truth, from the sound of it!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Edgeworth. Has this removed the last of your doubts?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Not at all, Your Honor. One very large doubt still remains.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
And what would that be?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
This is a surprisingly believable story, especially considering the source... So why did he think he needed to hide it from us until now? I intend to drag the reason out of him!
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
Hah ha ha! You'll regret this, Edgey!

Larry. What did you really see that night...? Not that I particularly care.

In your position, that's just being irresponsible! I... I drew exactly what I saw! I'll give you a whole dollar that it's the truth!

</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
A foolhardy folly of a foolish statement by an equally foolishly foolhardy fool. How, exactly, can you make this claim?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...Tell us, Larry. According to this picture... ...the individual whom you say you saw was wearing a hood. Correct?
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
Of course she was! That run-down shack is quite a way from the bridge... The hood is what told me that this floating angel was my Iris! The hood is my darling Iris! And Iris is my darling hood! Waaah!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
It seems there are bigger fools in this world than the one at the defense's bench.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...Larry, there's something you need to be made aware of. On the night of the murder... Iris wasn't wearing her hood. She had given it to Wright as a gift! Are you going to change your story now? Perhaps suggest it was Wright who took flight!?

It was sitting in the snow, with a little gathered on top of it. It was very hard to spot, actually. I mean, it was dark out, too.

</p><p>Butz:<br/>
No matter what you may think when you look at me, I'm a pro. A genius security guard. I used a penlight I "borrowed" from my company to help in my search... And it sparkled really brightly, as if it was saying, "Here I am!" to me.

There is <span style="color:#E16935">blood</span> on the crystal sphere, isn't there? This naturally suggests that it was thrown away <span style="color:#E16935">after</span> the murder took place.

Your Honor! What do you think of the witness's statement!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I don't think there is a problem with it.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Hmph... You say that with such gusto that I suppose I must agree that is all there is to it.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
... Don't get smart with me! Get smart with this penalty!

This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Unfortunately, I'm afraid I can't accept that.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Well done, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
W-What?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I was only testing you just now.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
... Well then, why don't you try testing this penalty, too!?

That statement contradicts the data provided by this piece of evidence!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
It does? How do you mean?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Forgive me, Your Honor, but you yourself just said that it does!

That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong this trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Iris of Hazakura Temple...
</p>
<center><b>Guilty</b></center>

Judge:<br/>
The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
