Maya:<br/>
So how do you think the trial went this morning?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
How do you think it went!?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
It got a bit crazy in there. I just wonder if that killed our chances.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah, I guess it did get out of hand. Mr. Kudo's testimony did nothing to help us. Plus, now we don't even know the identity of the waitress who laced the coffee.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
All we know is what old Mr. Kudo saw... The apron straps, and the ribbon.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
And that the victim was wearing an earpiece when his eardrum was ruptured.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Talk about a terrifying case of contradictionitus.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Time to play doctor and find ourselves a cure then, huh?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Yeah, we've gotta find one for Maggey, or she's going to have a terminal case of guilty!

It is a small firm, but all of my employees are first-class programmers. Let's ask one of them what they are doing. Excuse me. What are you working on right now?
</p><p>Programmer:<br/>
I'm researching the impact of time-slicing common areas in multi-threaded code on logical access to shared global variables. Obviously, program structure heavily influences response time and performance, so the co-independence of global variables and memory overheads is vitally important to the success of the execution.
</p><p>Basil:<br/>
Well, you get the idea. This is the sort of thing we are involved in. Did you good people follow all of that?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Y-Y-Yeah...

It's a lunchbox. I got up early so I could make it. I've been real worried about her. She looked like she'd lost a lot of weight.

</p><p>Kudo:<br/>
Of course not, you idiot! All I'm good for nowadays is running errands!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Errands?
</p><p>Kudo:<br/>
Everyone takes advantage of the elderly! "Buy some bread, gramps!" "Take the dog for a walk, granddad!" "Feed the pigeons, old man!" What am I? Some sort of two-bit community handyman!?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Um, well...
</p><p>Kudo:<br/>
"Buy some bread", now that I can understand. But what's the point of feeding some seedy pigeons!? Why don't people say what they mean!? "Get lost!" That's what they're trying to say! Oh, yes! I'm just an inconvenience, you see! At home... At that restaurant... I just get in the way, don't I!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I-I'm sure you don't. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Wait a minute! What did he just say? At home and... <span style="color:#E16935">at that restaurant</span>?)</span> Hold up... By "restaurant", are you talking about Tr√©s Bien? Did you get asked to run an errand there, too?
</p><p>Kudo:<br/>
Yes, I did! The very day that young brat was poisoned.

Yessiree, the owner was at Tr√©s Bien on his own.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Why didn't you mention this in court this morning?
</p><p>Kudo:<br/>
Well, I would have if you'd given me the chance! But you all bullied me out of the courtroom!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
*sigh* Thank you, Mr. Kudo. You've certainly earned your kudos for today.
</p><p>Kudo:<br/>
WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! If that's the case, there's more! I've got more to say! Oh, yes! I remember something else...

Is it really that important that Mr. Kudo was the one who called the police...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What's important is <span style="color:#E16935">the unaccounted time</span> before the police arrived. The victim was dead, and Maggey was unconscious.

Weren't you scared? It was pretty touch and go in there.

Yeah, but you totally nailed that old man!

He's not the only one!

Yup. There are just so many things that don't seem to add up. The biggest contradiction is the <span style="color:#E16935">other guy</span> I saw at the victim's table. HE was the one who slipped something into the victim's coffee. I'm sure it was him!

You said that you passed out when the victim, Glen Elg, collapsed, right?

Yes. It's so embarrassing. I mean, I used to be a cop! When I came to, the restaurant was buzzing with police. And before I knew what was going on, they arrested me, sir.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So between the time the victim collapsed and the time the police arrived on the scene... ...you have no idea <span style="color:#E16935">what went on</span> at Tr√©s Bien.

No. No idea at all. Why? Is it important, Mr. Wright?

The other witness, the old man from the park, was pretty much chased out of the picture.
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
"Chased out of the picture"? What do you mean?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Old Seedy wasn't inside the restaurant because he was told to go call the police.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Exactly. And you, Maggey, were unconscious. That means Mr. Armstrong was alone in the restaurant for a brief period of time.
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
No... Y-You don't think Mr. Armstrong... set me up... do you?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
When you consider the facts... ...it's hard to imagine that Mr. Armstrong isn't involved in this at all.

Grr! It's like the master biting the paw of the dog that it feeds! Are you sure about this, Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well, the old man said as much when we spoke with him earlier.

I don't know. The things that man says don't add up for some reason, sir...

A virus is a program that gets inside a computer and causes damage.

Damage? You mean it makes the machine go "boom" and explode?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
No. The damage is, um... Well, it's all internal.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
So the inside goes "boom", right?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Imagine all the case data you've got stored on your PCs here in the station... A virus could wipe out all that. That's the kind of damage I'm talking about.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Whoa! That's scary.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah. And what's even more scary is that viruses are infectious.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Infectious?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Most computers are connected together on a network, right? A virus can move on machine to another over the network. So the virus just keeps spreading faster and faster.

Hmph. Just like a real virus, huh.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
But, Nick! Why would anyone want to make a program like that?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yeah. It takes ages to type in all that data. Why would you wanna destroy it, pal?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
No. People don't infect their own machines. They send the virus to someone else's.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
What!? That's horrible!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Oh, I get it... It's like you sneezing on Godot so he catches a cold.

The data queue that manages system tasks for trouble-shooting requires that the multi-tasking simulation for local variables be put into sleep mode so that data transmission on active nodes can be bundled correctly according to the source code. ...Obviously.
