Actually, my fever has gone down quite a bit.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
How's your temperature now?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Only 102.2 degrees... Nothing to worry about. *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Anyway... I read today's trial record. You weren't bad, Edgeworth... Pretty impressive despite the circumstances.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
We're not in the clear yet. The main point of contention tomorrow is going to be the <span style="color:#E16935">murder weapon</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
In the end, the Shichishito did not deliver the deadly blow. Which means there must be another sword hiding out there that we don't know about...

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...Thanks again, Edgeworth. I'll handle things from here.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Heh... That is probably for the best. Actually, I was thinking about paying the old precinct a little visit. There's something I want to look into...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
And that is...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Our client's background, naturally.

I have the feeling that we've met before.

All I want is confirmation, one way or the other. And since I probably won't be getting that from you...

I bid you adieu, Wright. ...Take care.

Guess I should get moving, too.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Why? Do you need to be somewhere?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yeah, I've gotta get to work on this bridge, pal. I'm rigging something up so we can get across to the other side.

Th-Thank you, Gumshoe! *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough*

No problem, pal. Just try not to give me that cough of yours, OK? Alright, I'm off!

You read the whole thing?

Yes. Every last word of every last sentence of every last paragraph. All the ridiculous things you did made it a very interesting read, you know. Attempting to cross a burning bridge? Did you even consider the dangers?

No. The only thought in my mind was, "I have to get across."

<p><i>After examining sacred cavern entrance and hanging scroll:</i>
</p><p>???:<br/>
What took you so long? I thought even you'd manage to get here faster than this, Mr. Trite.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
P-Prosecutor Godot! I didn't know you were here.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Prosecutor?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
How come you didn't show up at the trial today?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! I could ask you the exact same question.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh? But I was... I had a cold, so...
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
I had something slightly more important than a common cold to deal with. The importance of which is something you have no hope of ever understanding.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Enough! I believe I have the measure of you. You are the very worst kind of prosecutor. What could be more important than a trial?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
... Who's the wild mare, Trite?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
This is Ms. von Karma. She was the acting prosecutor in your absence today.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! Well, I guess I owe you one then. But you can go now, princess. It's time for the big boys to take the reins.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Just who do you think you are!? This case is my...
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Hey, Filly. Know your role, and shut your mouth. I can't stand women like you. I'm only going to say this once, Lady von Whippingberg. Go home!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
... Phoeeenix Wriiight!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh-What are you hitting me for!?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! You deserve more cracks of the whip than that, Trite.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh-What!?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
You still don't get it, do you? You don't realize that you've set something in motion that you'll never be able to undo.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(There's something different about Godot today... I'm getting such a strong sense of... something from behind that mask of his. Is it <span style="color:#E16935">anger</span>? Or... Is it... <span style="color:#E16935">sorrow</span>?)</span>

</p><p>Godot:<br/>
I'm afraid we can't do that. This area has always been prone to earthquakes. The repeated tremors have weakened the foundations of the Training Hall. Any excessive force used to break the lock open would... Well, let's just say the Inner Temple and the Sacred Cavern would be a thing of the past.

Simple. The accused.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What? Iris?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
When an acolyte undergoes training inside the Sacred Cavern... ...the attending sister is responsible for locking the entrance. Obviously, the night of the murder was no exception. Maya Fey was to train in there.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

It's top secret. You can't tell anyone, got it?

</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>

We have the best scientific forensic team in the world working the place!

</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Nothing! Scientifically speaking, the place is as clean as a whistle.

Edgeworth?

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>

</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Really? Do tell...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Well, on the night of the murder... ...that stone lantern was <span style="color:#E16935">upside-down</span>!

Ahem! Anyway, there's really only one logical explanation to this mystery. <span style="color:#E16935">Ms. Elise Deauxnim</span> wrote these letters <span style="color:#E16935">herself</span>, in her own blood.

How quickly you forget, Phoenix Wright. Ever since the incident occurred, this place has been completely <span style="color:#E16935">inaccessible</span>... ...because Dusky Bridge was <span style="color:#E16935">completely burned out</span>.

Sister Bikini. The truth is becoming increasingly clear to me. I'm convinced that Ms. Elise Deauxnim had a special significance to this temple. As to why she had a special significance, I believe it has to do with her <span style="color:#E16935">true identity</span>.

What on Earth are you talking about? She... She was... M-Mystic Elise was an author. Just an author... of picture books.

To be honest... I had my suspicions almost immediately after I met her.

S-Suspicions?

Yes. But I didn't have any evidence to support my theory, though. <span style="color:green">But now I do. This piece of evidence proves Ms. Deauxnim's true identity!</span>

Of course. You run along now! People may have been hurt. I must get some first aid kits ready.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
... That's no excuse for letting the suspect get away... I can't believe I let it happen. Wright, the Inner Temple area is a dead end, so she only could've escaped to this side.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
We haven't seen her.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Then we need to get a manhunt underway now, and search Eagle Mountain from top to bottom!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wait, Edgeworth. Have you thoroughly checked the Inner Temple yet?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Don't be ridiculous! Why would I? The Inner Temple is like an island. There's no way to escape but to cross...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
No, that's not it... Iris isn't the type of person to run away, Edgeworth.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
What are you talking about?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Sister Bikini mentioned something when we were with her. She said that the Sacred Cavern might've caved in because of the quake.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Then you think Iris might've gone to the Inner Temple to check on the situation...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Listen, Edgeworth. I'm sure she's at the Inner Temple. A manhunt is not necessary.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Wright...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Let's not waste any more time. We need to get to the Training Hall's Sacred Cavern now!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
... Alright. Let's go!

And you aren't the one who set these locks?

I don't think it's that simple, Franziska von Karma. When we were here the first time, there was <span style="color:#E16935">only one lock</span>. But now, somehow, there's five of them...
</p><p>Iris:<br/>
What does that mean?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It means that someone wanted to secure the place even more... And they wanted to secure it before you got here, Iris. Presumably because they wanted to make sure Maya couldn't get out. This means that Iris can only open one of these locks. The <span style="color:#E16935">first one</span>.
</p><p>Iris:<br/>
... Yes... That's correct.

What?

Exactly. As you know, those things couldn't have been planted here after the murder.

That thing looks like it's ready to collapse... At least more than it did before. According to Bikini, Eagle Mountain is very prone to earthquakes. I had a feeling something bad was going to happen, and sure enough, it did. Yup. Edgeworth definitely couldn't live up here!

... But who... who could've done that...? The only people who know how to set those trick locks are those of the Kurain Tradition.

</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
Oh, yes. We were in the middle of a chat, weren't we?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes. You were telling me how the Master of Kurain disappeared 17 years ago. I want to know why Misty Fey suddenly appeared at this temple.
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
It was about a week ago when Mystic Elise... No, I mean Mystic Misty, arrived. After she showed me the talisman that proved she was the Master, she said... "Someone is trying to destroy the Kurain Tradition's main family line. I am here to put a stop to them."
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Someone was trying to destroy the <span style="color:#E16935">main family line</span>?
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
There is only one heir to the title of "Master" at any time, and it's usually the eldest. That child becomes the new Master of Kurain, and her daughters, the <span style="color:#E16935">main family</span>. All other mediums become <span style="color:#E16935">branch family</span> members, with no hope of controlling the clan.

It was the first time in the country's history the police ever used a <span style="color:#E16935">spirit medium</span>. The idea was to channel the victim's spirit to learn the identity of the murderer.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(And the medium who performed the channeling was <span style="color:#E16935">Misty Fey</span>, Maya's mother.)</span>
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
Through Mystic Misty's channeling, the name of a certain man surfaced. Armed with that as evidence, the investigators were spurred into action...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But that man... He was found <span style="color:#E16935">not guilty</span>, wasn't he?
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
...That's right. He was. And the case remained a mystery... In other words, we failed. It was the first case the world had ever seen the Kurain Tradition openly involved in. It was all over the media. The public, the judiciary, the people of Kurain Village... Everyone judged her. Everyone said Mystic Misty's powers were a sham. And then she just disappeared; vanished, while everyone still thought of her as a fraud.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But I know the truth! Misty Fey's spirit channeling wasn't a sham at all!

Of course it wasn't... And since you managed to reveal the truth, we're finally making a comeback. The Kurain Tradition is starting to recover at last. But with a new Master wielding the power of the clan...

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Really...!?
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
Well, she saw what happened to her own mother, Mystic Misty, as she grew up. I guess Mystic Mia got tired of seeing all the rivalry between her mom and her aunt.

Mystic Misty's sister is <span style="color:#E16935">Mystic Morgan</span>, as you probably know.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Morgan? There's a name I know well. It was a year ago now, at Maya's home, <span style="color:#E16935">Kurain Village</span>. What she did was terrible. It was all so she could make <span style="color:#E16935">her own daughter</span> the next Master.

... You jest! That child... She's Mystic Morgan's... ............ I had no idea... ............ ...Mystic Morgan... But she's in prison now, isn't she?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes. Ever since she was found to be a co-conspirator in a murder case last year. It was all done to set Pearls up as the next Master.
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
I see. So I've been wrong all this time. Mystic Morgan had <span style="color:#E16935">three daughters</span>, not two.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
Yes. Iris, <span style="color:#E16935">her twin sister</span>, and Mystic Pearl.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
WHAT!? Tw-<span style="color:#E16935">Twin sister</span>?
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
Oh, didn't you know? It all happened twenty years ago... After the clan leadership was taken from her by her sister, Mystic Morgan's life crumbled. It wasn't many years later that Kurain's reputation hit an all-time low. When Mystic Morgan's husband realized his wife would never become the Master... ...he left her and the village, taking their twin daughters with him.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
How awful...
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
He was a jeweler, you know. In the end he remarried, and that's when it happened. He decided to give one of his girls up, to be looked after by us here at the temple. That was Iris, you see.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's unbelievable! If Iris has a <span style="color:#E16935">twin sister</span>... Could it be...?)</span> Um, could you tell me one more thing, Sister Bikini? What was the <span style="color:#E16935">name</span> of Iris's sister?
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
............ I'm sorry, Mr. Wright. I just can't remember. All I can recall is that her father was a jeweler.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Well, that's a clue, I guess. Hmm... A jeweler...)</span>

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
... Thank you very much. You've helped clear up a lot of details. Pearls had two older sisters, huh...

Yes, that's right... No doubt it was all because of Mystic Morgan's anger towards the <span style="color:#E16935">main family</span>...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Anger? What do you mean?
</p><p>Bikini:<br/>
Her twin daughters were taken from her by her jeweler husband. But even that couldn't destroy her dream that a child of hers would one day lead the clan.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's why she had Pearls?)</span>

I'd never have guessed there'd be a sword concealed in the victim's staff.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
They call this kind of thing a <span style="color:#E16935">sword-cane</span>, pal. This one's a real gem... The workmanship is really something else! Thank goodness it wasn't a cane-sword, or else the victim would've stabbed her own foot!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...I officially give up on trying to figure out how Gumshoe's mind works. If the real scene of the crime was the <span style="color:#E16935">Inner Temple Garden</span>... Then why was the sword used to kill the victim found in the <span style="color:#E16935">Main Hall Courtyard</span>?)</span> Hey, Gumshoe... Who knows about the hidden sword?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
No one. Even the police didn't know about this until I discovered it just now.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Well, as they say, there's no "Team" in "Gumshoe".)</span> It doesn't look like there are any <span style="color:#E16935">traces of blood</span> on it.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
... Then I guess this isn't the murder weapon, huh?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
No, no, no! I'm sure someone just wiped it off after the murder!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
... Yeah, of course! This thing's definitely the murder weapon! Great job, pal!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's about the same length as the Shichishito, too. This must be the murder weapon!)</span>
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
OK, I'm gonna run over to forensics. There's gotta be some traces of blood left, even if most of it has been wiped off. See you later, pal! ♪Every case is gonna be airtight... Every case is gonna be airtight...♪

</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Maya? What's this got to do with her?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I don't know, but I'm starting to get a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Oh? How so?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Look, Maya's trapped inside the Sacred Cavern right now and... Well, we don't even know if she's OK or not... The more evidence and testimony I hear, the more uneasy I feel.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Y-You don't think...? Maya's been murd--
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Please, Detective! Let's just wait until we can get inside the Sacred Cavern.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
You're... looking kinda viridian there...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
OK, OK. Just stop it with that face, pal. One thing, though... This staff's secret trick... Let's keep it between you and me, alright? If it gets out that we knew about it and didn't say anything, we're finished.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...I understand.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
This is just a <span style="color:#E16935">regular, run-of-the-mill staff</span>, you got it? ...OK, now you take good care of it, pal.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Thank you, Detective.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
... Don't worry... She'll be fine.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Gumshoe...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
You know, there's a place at the base of this mountain that has some really good pasta. How about I take you there when you find Maya, huh, pal?

</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>

Ms. Deauxnim was an author and an illustrator, right? So what was she doing carrying a sword around with her?

<p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It was my first court case, six years ago. I was a greenhorn, and due to my inexperience, the defendant died.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You're talking about Terry Fawles, right?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...! Y-You know about that case...!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You're not the only one who noticed something about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne. I checked one of Mia's old files from six years ago.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Yes, Dahlia was a key witness in that case. Dahlia and Terry Fawles conspired together to stage a fake kidnapping 11 years ago. They stole a jewel worth 2 million dollars from Dahlia's father, a jeweler. And five years after that... ...she murdered her own sister, Valerie Hawthorne, to keep her from talking.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Her sister?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Well, her stepsister, actually. They weren't blood-related. Valerie was the only daughter of Dahlia's father's second wife.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Oh... <span style="color:#0070C0">(And this is when <span style="color:#E16935">she</span> entered my life... The <span style="color:#E16935">woman</span> who tried to kill me.)</span> So after Terry Fawles died, what happened to Dahlia? Did you check that out?

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Why are you so sure about that?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It's simple. Dahlia Hawthorne is <span style="color:#E16935">dead</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Well, her metabolic processes are a matter of interest only to historians, so to speak.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
And what is that?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It's about Iris and Dahlia Hawthorne's <span style="color:#E16935">mother</span>.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
What's their mother got to do with any of this?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
She's Morgan Fey. A spirit medium from a branch family of the Kurain Channeling Technique.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
... Did you say, "Kurain Channeling Technique"...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
D-Do you know something about it?

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(<span style="color:#E16935">Fraudulent</span>...?)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I was involved in another nightmare, 17 years ago. I was caught up in the middle of a murder investigation. The police didn't have any leads. They were stumped... And that's when they called her in. She was a very famous spirit medium and the "Master" of her channeling school. But you know what happened? As a result of her efforts, an innocent man was accused of murder! She and her powers! They were all fraudulent!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...Edgeworth...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Go to the Police Records Room. It's all in there. All you have to do is check the <span style="color:#E16935">DL-6 Incident</span> case file and you'll know!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Of course... How could I forget... Edgeworth was the <span style="color:#E16935">victim</span> in that case.)</span> Edgeworth... You'll understand someday... And then, you'll see that the Kurain Channeling Technique is real...

Our mother was the eldest daughter of the main branch of the Fey family. The main family had a lot of influence in many business and political circles at the time. As the eldest daughter, our mother was set to inherit all of that as the next Master. That's the reason our father married our mother in the first place. For power. But his plan backfired.

Iris... There's just one more thing I want you to tell me.

What is it...?

During the incident in which your sister, Dahlia Hawthorne, poisoned a lawyer... ...she began relations with <span style="color:#E16935">a certain college student</span> in order to hide the evidence. That college student... Have you heard anything about him...?
</p><p>Iris:<br/>
... Well... I did hear one thing... She said she hated his guts.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
... ...I see. Thank you for your help.
</p><p>Iris:<br/>
You're welcome...
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Hurry up, Phoenix Wright! There is still much to investigate!
</p><p>Iris:<br/>
Leave these locks to me. I'll open them for you, I promise.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Thank you. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I suppose I'd better continue my investigation. There's still one giant <span style="color:#E16935">secret</span> left to unlock... Pearls's <span style="color:#E16935">Psyche-Lock</span>...)</span> <i>[sic]</i>

What do you mean by <span style="color:#E16935">revenge</span>...?

He was a hideous man. He threw our mother away, and then sent her to Hell...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Her mother? She must be talking about <span style="color:#E16935">Morgan Fey</span>...)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br/>
Our mother was the eldest daughter of the main branch of the Fey family. The main family had a lot of influence in many business and political circles at the time. As the eldest daughter, our mother was set to inherit all of that as the next Master. That's the reason our father married our mother in the first place. For power. But his plan backfired. Because our mother's sister took it all from her. She took over as the Master of Kurain.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That would be <span style="color:#E16935">Misty Fey</span>... Maya's mother.)</span>
</p><p>Iris:<br/>
But before long, the credibility of the Kurain Tradition hit rock bottom. The new Master, Mystic Misty Fey, made a <span style="color:#E16935">terrible mistake</span>... It was during the investigation of the <span style="color:#E16935">DL-6 Incident</span>. After that happened... ...our father took me and my twin sister away, leaving our mother and our home behind. He hated the place. He said it was a hick dive, and that he had no reason to stay there.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
And that's when you came here to Hazakura Temple?
</p><p>Iris:<br/>
Yes. The woman my father took as his next wife already had a daughter... Valerie. I... I had no place in his new family, you see.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Oh...

And I haven't seen my mother once since then. Having the Master's seat stolen from her, and being rejected by her own family... I've heard she's been very battered, spiritually and emotionally.

Sister Bikini...

Her testimony in court today was very clear.

<p>Bikini:<br/>
That night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But... Well, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently. So, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
Sister Bikini didn't just see you, she spoke with you. You two talked about Maya's training that night. So you see, Iris... ...you were there at the Inner Temple on the night of the murder!

What time was that?

Let me see... It takes about 20 minutes to walk between the Main Hall and the Inner Temple. So, I would've left at about 9:40 PM, I think.

I... After dinner that night, I did go to the Inner Temple. With a pot full of the leftover gravy.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The gravy?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
I saw the picture on the hanging scroll near the Sacred Cavern. I was sure it was the Master of Kurain, like it said in the letter.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I see. And then?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Well, it was already way past 10 when I got there because of all the snow. So I went to the Inner Temple guest area.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The guest area?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Yes. I thought I could wait there until the training was over.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Why didn't you just go to the Training Hall?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Because Mystic Maya's main training had already started, and I couldn't interrupt it! So I just stayed where I was and prayed for her to get through it. But then... I... ...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Pearls, did you fall asleep?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! I just couldn't help it!
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
Hey, don't worry about it, Pearl! Who cares if you fell asleep? I fell asleep waiting for Iris, too. It happens.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Anyway... Then you found yourself trapped at the Inner Temple?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Yes. When I woke up, it was morning. I tried not to cry, but... ...Dusky Bridge wasn't there anymore and there was no one in the Training Hall. I thought everyone had left me because I overslept! I threw the letter into the incinerator, then I heated up the leftover gravy, and...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(And let off some steam by chucking the gravy on the scroll while you cried...?)</span>
</p><p>Butz:<br/>
It must've been pretty scary for you, Pearl. I know what it's like. Nick used to leave me behind when I fell asleep at school, too.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Don't equate something so trivial with her experience, Larry.

It was written right in my mother's letter. It said, "As soon as you hear the lights out bell, you must channel her spirit." I was on my way over to the Inner Temple when I heard the bell ring.

So you channeled Dahlia Hawthorne's spirit?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
No... I tried, but I couldn't do it!

... I suppose there's one other possibility. It's not very likely, though...

It could happen if someone else was already channeling the same spirit.

It says, "gravely"... That's kind of a tough word.

Sure, Ms. Deauxnim taught you how to read "<span style="color:#E16935">gravely</span>" and "<span style="color:#E16935">roast</span>". But what she didn't teach you... ...is <span style="color:#E16935">what they meant</span>!
