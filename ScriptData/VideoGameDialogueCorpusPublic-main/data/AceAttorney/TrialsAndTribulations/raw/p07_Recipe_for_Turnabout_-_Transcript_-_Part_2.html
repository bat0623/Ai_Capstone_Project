Byrde:<br/>
Oh... I see... I guess I should've expected this. Nobody saw the other guy, huh? But he was there when I took the coffee over, sir. Scout's honor!
</p><p>???:<br/>
Maggey!
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
Ack! D-Detective Gumshoe!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
A-Are you doing alright!? How're you feeling!?
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
...As if you need to ask either question, sir.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Don't let 'em get you down, Maggey. And don't forget to eat well, OK?
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
Roger!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
And you!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Y-Yes?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
You'd better square this case away, got it pal!? Maggey's innocent, you hear!? If you screw up, then I'll be doing some squaring away myself. Squaring away some paperwork for your arrest!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I-I think he's serious!)</span>
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Hey, Detective! You're on our side for once, right?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yup.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
So you'll be able to help Maggey out, right?
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
Really? Can you, sir!?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
O... Of course! I've got the simulation under control! I'm gonna be the first witness on the stand today. If something I say doesn't mesh with the facts, make sure you point it out, alright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
S-Sure.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
OK. We're forming a united front today, pal. You get me!?
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
I can't tell you how grateful I am, sir! I've always admired you so much, Detective. I know I can count on you.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Looks like it should all go pretty smoothly today, huh?

<p><br/>
Judge:<br/>
Court is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
... Aaah, bitter!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr... Um... Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Y-Yes, Your Honor?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Aaaah!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh-What's wrong!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Nothing. It's just whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... "Youse talkin' to me!?" It was a little, well... intimidating.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
No, no! That wasn't me. That was the phony Phoenix.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">("Our trusty"...?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
So, Mr. Godot. Your opening statement, please.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Mr. Trite... Whether you're a fake or the real deal... We will find out soon enough through this trial today.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But I can already tell you! I'm the real Phoenix Wright!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
I wasn't questioning whether you are Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you had studied law or not. That's what I intend to find out.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(There's no denying it. Behind that mask is a man who <span style="color:#E16935">really hates me</span> for some reason or another!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
As everyone is aware, the court has already given its verdict on this case once. Therefore, I won't stand for irrelevant testimony during this retrial. Nor will I stand for a simple repetition of the evidence presented in the last trial.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I'm not planning on repeating anything that phony me said! Trust me!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Now then. Mr. Godot, please summon your first witness.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Godot:<br/>
Let's start with the formalities, shall we? Name and occupation?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Witness! State your name for the court!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Huh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name's Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Other way around, Detective.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Huh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I'm the officer in charge of this case since yesterday. Sir!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Since yesterday?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
I hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Y-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The court accepts this into evidence.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Glen's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Um... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The waitress being the <span style="color:#E16935">accused</span>?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Tr√©s Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Come, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant's coffin shut with your own two hands.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Now then, Detective Gumshoe. Let's have your testimony.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Umm... Yes, sir...

<hr/>
<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span></center>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- The Incident --</span></center>
<p>Gumshoe:<br/>
When the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.<br/>
We understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.<br/>
Traces of poison were found in his coffee cup.<br/>
And what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!<br/>
And, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm...
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Using the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Please, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I already told you! That wasn't me!

The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.<br/>
Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.<br/>
The victim didn't have any identification on him.<br/>

"Scary old man", Detective Gumshoe?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
There's an old man who's a regular at the restaurant where the incident happened.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ah, we're obviously talking about the same old man...)</span>
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Officers were dispatched right after the report came in, but the old guy still made a fuss. "What took you so long!?" Then he hurled abuse at them. And seeds...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... Seeds...
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! It was nothing! I caught each one with my teeth.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I guess not even the mighty Godot can avoid being attacked by that guy...)</span>
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
The old man was only other customer in the place at the time. He took his time finding a pay phone apparently, so he was late reporting the crime.

How long was the defendant unconscious for?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
The officers got to the crime scene at around 2:40. Maggey was still out cold in the kitchen at that time. It took another 10 minutes or so before she came to. I woulda liked to have been on the scene myself.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I bet you would've liked to have carried out the search, too...)</span>

He didn't have any? Are you saying that it was stolen, then?

No, I don't think so. The victim didn't have a driver's license or even a credit card on him, pal. All he had was 58 cents in his wallet.

Fifty-eight cents...?

Yeah, basically.

Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you. There is just one small contradiction in your testimony.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Oho! Finally! I'm getting all anxious just waiting, so hurry up, will you?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You testified that, "nothing else was missing from the crime scene." However! The prescription bag you mentioned was <span style="color:#E16935">empty</span>! Did the officers recover the medicine from the scene of the crime later?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Um, no. They didn't.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The victim was given a prescription right before going to Tr√©s Bien. Where, then, did the medicine disappear to!?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Y-You... ...are toooooo coool, pal!!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I-Indeed! Due consideration wasn't given to the victim's prescription in the previous trial. Witness! Why do you always overlook such vital pieces of evidence!?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
I, er... I guess that's the most careless thing I've done so far, huh?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The victim was killed by <span style="color:#E16935">poison</span>! And the victim's "<span style="color:#E16935">medicine</span>" mysteriously disappeared! The victim's own prescription could have been the lethal poison itself!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
O-Order! Order! Well, Mr. Godot? What do you have to say to that?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! That's all.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What!?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Read for the court the name of the clinic on the prescription bag, if you will.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What's the clinic's name got to do with anything...? "New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic" O-Otolaryngological?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Just what kind of illness was the victim suffering from, Mr. Godot?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Hardly an illness, Your Honor. More like a bitter war wound, you could say.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
A war wound?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
The day before the incident, Mr. Elg found himself in a fight. He took a blow to the side of the head, and <span style="color:#E16935">ruptured his eardrum</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
He ruptured his eardrum!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Then what on earth was the <span style="color:#E16935">prescription</span> he was given?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
It was a cream that was to be <span style="color:#E16935">applied topically</span> inside his ear canal, not to be ingested!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What!?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
It's mentioned in the autopsy report, if you read the fine print. They found traces of the medication in the victim's left ear.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes. Here it is. In very, very fine print.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Tr√©s Bien. Therefore, it would be absurd to believe that he would have eaten his medication.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Uuurgh...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
It seems that this medication is irrelevant to the case after all.

N-No...

Nick! If you don't think of something quick, it'll all be over!

Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement. "It seems Mr. Elg correctly <span style="color:#E16935">applied</span> some of his medication while he was at Tr√©s Bien." If that's the case, then why was the medication not found at the scene of the crime!?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
But the medication in question was for topical use inside the ear canal!

The name is Victor Kudo. Born and bred in the Land of the Rising Sun! Honor and duty are what make me. Mind you, I can be quite emotional at times, too.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
We don't need to hear about that, Mr. Kudo. Just tell the court your occupation.
</p><p>Kudo:<br/>
My occupation? Kah! Listen, young'un! How much call d'you think there is for kimono embroidery here!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Kimono embroidery?
</p><p>Kudo:<br/>
That's what I do! Or did, back in Japan. I embroidered family crests on kimonos! My ancestors were embroidering kimonos before this country even existed!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Wow, a real craftsman! They're a dying breed! Hey! Maybe he could embroider my costume sometime.
</p><p>Kudo:<br/>
Anyway, like I said. There's not much demand for that kind of thing here. So I had to take a job working the cash register at a burger joint... pretending to smile!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That burger joint would've been better off putting him in the kitchen...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Now then, witness. Were you in the restaurant at the time of the incident?
</p><p>Kudo:<br/>
Oh, yes! I was eating some seeds over a cup of javaccino.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Seeds?
</p><p>Kudo:<br/>
What do you think these are, hmm!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I-I see...
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
So you saw everything that happened, gramps?

Did I!? Oh, yes! Oh, yes I did! I saw it all!

That being the defendant, Ms. Maggey Byrde?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Exactly. And when that one waitress put the poison into the coffee cup... ...this old guy was watching!

Hmm... I hope you understand the gravity of the situation, Mr. Kudo. The fate of the defendant may rest on what you say you remember seeing.

He was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles.<br/>
He had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages!<br/>
The young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well.<br/>
Then the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino.<br/>
The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
The testimony we have just heard was to test how credible the witness's memory is. It seems to me that he remembers the victim in a great deal of detail.

Oh, yes! I hate those you-know-what types who are so vague about everything!

The boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.<br/>
He kept fiddling with it all the time.<br/>
He was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too.<br/>
And then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!

<p>Judge:<br/>
We know that the victim was wearing an unusual monocle over his left eye.

It wasn't a monocle, Your Honor. It was a small computer monitor often used by programmers.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
A monitor? You mean, like a television screen!?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
The inside of the lens is a screen that displays computer data. It's called an HMD. It's a common tool in the victim's line of work.

</p><p>Kudo:<br/>
Eh?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Traces of medication for his condition were found in his ear canal. That's right! It's impossible that the victim was wearing his earpiece in his left ear. Because he couldn't even hear in that ear!
</p><p>Kudo:<br/>
... Is that true, Captain?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
...It is.
</p><p>Kudo:<br/>
...Pi... Pi-Pi-Pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm... Pretty pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! Order!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
This witness's testimony is completely unreliable! He only saw the witness from behind. And he claims the victim was wearing an earpiece when we know his eardrum was ruptured! Well, Mr. Godot!?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Aaaargh! A single drop of milk is all it takes to destroy the pure black magic in the cup! The old man... ...is my drop of milk!
</p><p>Kudo:<br/>
Captain! Are you calling me a drip!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
This is the victim's coffee cup in which the potassium cyanide was found. The mark on the rim clearly shows that the victim picked it up with his <span style="color:#E16935">right hand</span>!
</p><p>Kudo:<br/>
I'll never back down! I know I'm right! The lad drank his javaccino with his <span style="color:#E16935">left hand</span>!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Let me put you out of your misery... Clearly, the victim used both hands. He took a sip with the cup held in his right hand, and then switched to his left... That's what the old man saw!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

Which hand the victim used to pick up his cup is irrelevant, Your Honor. The facts still stand! With one hand or the other, Mr. Elg drank the poisoned coffee... ...Like this!

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Sadly, Mr. Godot, that doesn't wash! The point of this testimony was to establish whether the witness's memory was credible. And the results are clear! The testimony given by this witness is useless!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Puuuurgh!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I believe it is time to conclude today's proceedings. I am satisfied that the witness is not deceiving the court. But to be frank, his testimony is a farce!
</p><p>Kudo:<br/>
D-Did you have to be so frank!? Take that, you pompous old fogey!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo. You can't reach me from there. I'm ordering the defense and the prosecution to investigate this case further. That is all for now. This court is adjourned!

I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but there's nothing I can do.
</p><p>Kudo:<br/>
I've kept my mouth shut until now... ...but there's something else the court should know!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
What!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
There's more?
</p><p>Kudo:<br/>
To be perfectly honest, it might not be anything. But I want another chance! I want another crack at you, you young shark!

M-Me? <span style="color:#0070C0">(He's looking at me like I'm some sort of evil Shogun...)</span>

You bet! Much, much quicker!

Yeah. "So what?" probably! That's all I can think of, and I have to cross-examine this guy!

Er, I'd like to ask a question now. Have I, er... Have I been any use at all?

Perhaps that's something you should reflect on yourself, Mr. Kudo.

Well! We seem to have been considerably sidetracked. And I am still not in a position to deliver a verdict.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The defendant has not been positively identified as the waitress in question. Additionally, there are <span style="color:#E16935">two</span> disparities in the testimony we have heard thus far.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The mark on the coffee cup that the victim supposedly drank from with his <span style="color:#E16935">left hand</span>. And the earpiece which was inserted into his <span style="color:#E16935">left ear</span>, out of which he couldn't hear.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Wow, Nick! You did it!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I therefore require both the defense and the prosecution to further investigate the facts.

Yes, Your Honor.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
There is one more thing before I call today's session to an end.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
O-One more thing, Your Honor?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The witness we just heard from... He is most insistent that his testimony should be of use. So he's summarized it accordingly into this statement.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Um... OK...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You may each have a copy of it, if you wish.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Whatever. The prosecution doesn't need props like that.

Godot's really mad, huh?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah. I would be, too.

Very well. Here you are then, Mr. Wright. There are 3 copies. My own, yours, and Mr. Godot's.

Uh... I'm not sure I follow you.

It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...

Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.

That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Maggey Byrde...

The accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!
