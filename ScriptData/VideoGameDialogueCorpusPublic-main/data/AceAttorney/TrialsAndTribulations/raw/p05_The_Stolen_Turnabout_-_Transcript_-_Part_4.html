Maya:<br/>
Hey! Nick!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What is it this time?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
You won't believe how many people are here for the trial!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well... It is a murder case.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
What are you talking about? They're here for the trial next door!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
"Next door"...?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Why don't you know this, Nick? *sigh* They're having Detective Atmey's trial today!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Detective Atmey...?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
They say they're going to try him as Mask☆DeMasque.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Already? That was fast...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Boy, I'd love to see Mask☆DeMasque's trial.
</p><p>???:<br/>
<span style="color:#E16935">...I know...</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
By the way, where's Pearls?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Oh, she went back home. She said she can't neglect her training anymore.
</p><p>???:<br/>
<span style="color:#E16935">...I know you don't like me...</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Pearls has really gotten into her training lately, huh?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Yeah... Ever since... ...that incident last year.
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
Pleeeeease! Don't ignore meeee!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
...Oh, Mr. DeLite! Good morning!
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
No one likes me... No one would notice me, even if I killed someone...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Come on, don't be silly! ... W-Wait a sec!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You don't mean... You're the murderer...!?
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
N-N-N-No, no! I'm just a poor thief! ... No, wait, that's not right. A thief <span style="color:grey">can't really be "poor"</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Now, let's see... According to Mr. DeLite... From his second crime on, he was following a bunch of <span style="color:#E16935">set plans</span>. Plans that someone had been sending to him to <span style="color:#E16935">"help" him commit the heists</span>.)</span>
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Do you think there's a connection between the thief and the murder, Nick?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It's possible... But today's trial is a race against the clock.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Huh? How come? Let's just take our time like always.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I'm afraid... That's not an option.

<p><br/>
Judge:<br/>
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Ron DeLite.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
You're "ready"? Preparation is the last refuge of the week.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
...OK, settle down everyone. Let's begin with your opening statement, Mr. Godot.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh... He's got the judge in the palm of his hands... Yet again...)</span>
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ron DeLite is simply too young to be sent to war. ...That's all.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
... I'm afraid I have no idea what that means, Mr. Godot.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! Then you need to get out more, Your Honor. Life is war. But that is exactly why you must be more precise in your wording. That's all my statement means. You understand now, right?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
...Yes. Well then, let me briefly summarize the details of this case.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Wow... The judge is taking charge like he knows what's going on for a change...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The victim is Kane Bullard, CEO of KB Security. His body was found in a safe at approximately 9 AM on the morning of the 13th. However, the time of death was estimated as <span style="color:#E16935">1 AM</span> of the previous day.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
And... that's when our little lost kitten dropped the ball. That little lost kitten is, of course, the defendant.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well then, Mr. Godot. Please call your first witness.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
I never drink more than 17 cups of coffee during any given trial. But the first one... is always the best.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Um, Mr. Godot... Your witness...?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
...OK, then. Let's hear what the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite, has to say for himself.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The defendant...? Well, Mr. Wright? Does the defense have any objections? It may be a bit of a disadvantage having the defendant testify, but...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I remember when Mia was defending me... She allowed me to testify so she could do the cross-examination... She put a lot of <span style="color:#E16935">trust</span> in me back then...)</span> We have no objections, Your Honor. The defense will allow Mr. DeLite to testify.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! You've got guts, Trite.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Alright then, Mr. Ron DeLite, please take the stand!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Godot:<br/>
...You did it. Didn't you?
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
Yes.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What?
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
Uh... No no no no no no no! Th-Th-Th-That's not true!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
...Hmm. For a moment there I thought we'd set the record for the shortest trial ever.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
*sigh* Well, Mr. DeLite already looks plenty guilty with that face he's making...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
And once he opens his big mouth he'll probably put the last nail in his own coffin...
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! Very well. Now then... Can you tell me something? If you didn't kill Bullard, why did you go to KB Security?
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
W-W-Well, I... That's kind of hard to say. Boy, I w<span style="color:grey">ish I could go home</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Now then, let's hear some testimony about what happened!

<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- My Visit To KB Security --</span></center>
<p>Ron:<br/>
That evening, around 1 AM, I went to see Mr. Bullard in his office at KB Security.<br/>
The blackmail letter I got... It ordered me to go there.<br/>
I'd been working for KB Security until a year ago, so I knew where his office was.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
1 AM... The exact time the murder took place.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
The weak get washed away by the tides of fate... The strong drink it up. Ha...! It's bitter today, too... Just like my destiny.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
You'd never know that from the way he's chugging it down.

Mr. DeLite stole company data to pay for his wife's spending habit, for which he was fired. Unable to face his own wife, someone used this dirty little secret to blackmail him. And that is how this murder came about!

I didn't think it was possible to get so thoroughly whipped in just 20 minutes...

Clearly there was sufficient motive for murder. He stole data for his wife, and he killed to protect his secret... A family man who cared just a little too much.

The record for the emergency buzzer that connects the CEO's office to security. If the button in the office is pressed, a security team is supposed to come running...

This buzzer is extremely loud. There is no way he could've ignored something like that! IF he had been conscious, that is.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
"Conscious"...? What do you mean by that!?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
... Ugh...! Fine. Let's hear your theory.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Remember the defendant's testimony. The moment he entered the victim's office, someone attacked him... Mr. DeLite said he felt "dazed"... I'm willing to wager that he was knocked unconscious for at least a few minutes.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Unconscious...? So he fainted!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That's why Mr. DeLite didn't know that the buzzer had sounded. And that's why... he thought he had time to hide the body!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
S-So what are you trying to say...!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Mr. DeLite was knocked out, and the buzzer went off soon afterwards... Now, unless my client was able to hit the buzzer while he was unconscious... It can only mean that there was another person in that room! That's right! Whoever it was knocked out Ron DeLite and then pressed the buzzer!

O-Order in the court! Mr. Wright! This... This is...!

D-Do you mean to say the killer called the guard on purpose!?

Yes... Although as it turned out, he never showed up.

Because he was getting his clock cleaned at the time...
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! What a touching story! You're saying the killer had a change of heart and called the guard to turn himself in?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
No, I'm not. When that buzzer sounded, there were <span style="color:#E16935">three people</span> in that office. The victim, Kane Bullard, who was already dead. The defendant, Ron DeLite, who was out cold. And... The third person. The <span style="color:#E16935">real killer</span>.

Mask☆DeMasque had the perfect alibi for when the murder took place. He was stealing the urn at Lordly Tailor. ...In other words! Being <span style="color:#E16935">found guilty</span> as Mask☆DeMasque... ...was Luke Atmey's airtight, watertight, and unassailable alibi.

A <span style="color:#E16935">guilty verdict</span>... AS AN ALIBI!?

<p>Godot:<br/>
You know... It's almost time.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
F-For what?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
For Luke Atmey's verdict. It was a pretty simple trial, after all. If we're going to stop this trial and stall that one, we need to do it now. Of course... That's assuming you have proof that the detective was the one who committed the murder.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Luke Atmey's trial has indeed attracted the attention of the entire country. If we were to intrude, and failed to provide adequate proof of his true crime...  Mr. DeLite would be left with no grounds for appeal.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

<p>Atmey:<br/>
Well well... How do you do, Sir Lawyer? I never would have thought to see you acting so recklessly.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I couldn't let them hand down your verdict just yet. Not when it would have given you your <span style="color:#E16935">perfect alibi</span>. An alibi by the name of "Mask☆DeMasque"...
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
I'm sorry. I'm afraid even the great Luke Atmey has no idea what you mean. Of course, I have been in the next courtroom ever since 10 o'clock this morning. ...I'm afraid there's no way I could know what's been going on in here.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You've been in the defendant's seat all day long, correct? Being tried as Mask☆DeMasque...
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Indeed... It's truly child's play to fool the ignorant masses. Not only did the poor fools ask me to "protect" their valuables... ...they even gave me a generous reward upon returning their own property to them. Take this red diamond ring that sparkles upon my divine finger, for example...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So you continue to insist that you are, in fact, "Mask☆DeMasque"?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
...Of course.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well then, Luke Atmey. Let us begin with this simple question. On October 12th at 1 AM. Kane Bullard was murdered. Where were you at that time?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
One without knowledge lacks even the knowledge that he should be ashamed of himself. ...But don't worry. I will not hold it against you, Sir Judge.

Why, this... this is a <span style="color:#E16935">bloodstain</span>! Ah! Blood! Now this case is getting interesting!

Umm, not exactly... This stain is actually pink paint.

Oh, just paint... And peach-colored at that.

Well, there's a good reason for that. On the day of the crime, around noon... ...that golden statue just happened to arrive from the mountain training hall.

I realized that the statue would be the perfect size for covering up the paint stains. That's why... I put it where you first saw it.

Jumping to conclusions again? I think you need to take a gander in your logical mirror.

As the Yiddish proverb goes, "A half-truth is a whole lie".
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Keep lying like this and you'll be the one on trial.

</p><p>Maya:<br/>
The question is why was the statue moved, right?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
There was some reason the culprit didn't want the statue in the picture... At least, that's what I thought.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
I'll ask you again, Mr. Trite.
</p><p><i>Leads back to:</i><br/>
"Just where in this picture does this "lie" exist!?"
</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
Naturally... the lie in this photo is the <span style="color:#E16935">timestamp</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Wh-What do you mean!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I'll tell you exactly what I mean! On the night in question, Luke Atmey went to KB Security and murdered Kane Bullard! Therefore, it's obvious! It would have been impossible for him to have been at Lordly Tailor at this time!
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
But what does that have to do with the statue being moved...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Remember if you will, Your Honor. <span style="color:#E16935">When</span> was this statue placed besides the warehouse door...?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
W-Well...
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
The statue was taken down to the warehouse on <span style="color:#E16935">the day of the crime</span>... ...and it was placed there in order to cover up the paint.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...Exactly. Luke Atmey had already decided on the time when he was going to kill the victim. And so, in order to create an <span style="color:#E16935">alibi for that time</span>... ...he took this picture days before the murder took place!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Wh-What the...!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Of course, the statue hadn't yet been brought down to the basement warehouse yet.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Ah...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So, on the day of the crime, Mr. Atmey must have been quite nervous! As nervous as a long-tailed cat in a rocking chair factory, so to speak. Why? Because something that wasn't supposed to be there... ...had been brought down and placed where it wasn't supposed to be. And that... ...is why Luke Atmey had to move the statue on the night of the murder! He did it to make the room match with the way it had been in his photo!
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
... GWAAAAAAAH!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! Mr. Atmey! Is this true!?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
One moment, Your Honor! H-Have you forgotten this?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Wh-What's that...?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
The data for the basement warehouse computer! According to this, the camera did indeed go off on the night of the crime!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:File"><a class="mw-file-description image" href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445"><img class="mw-file-element lazyload" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" decoding="async" height="192" loading="lazy" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" width="260"/></a></span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It's true that the camera had been set up by the Lordly Tailor staff. However! The program used to manage that data was yours! That alone would have allowed you to tamper with the data!
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Ah... AAAAAAAAAAAHHH!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! Mr. Godot! What is the meaning of this!? Godot! I warned you about making me wait! Now put that coffee down!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
...My 11th cup. I've promised to drink no more than 17 during a trial. Which means... I'm still good 'til the last drop.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
However, the defense has a very good point!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
"A good point"...? So what? We are all but travelers on a road of infinite points.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
<span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [Um, I think you've got your 'points' mixed up with your other 'points'...] in the original release">Um, I think he's got his "points" mixed up with his other "points"...</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [Um, I think you've got your 'points' mixed up with your other 'points'...] in the original release)</span>
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
...So you say this photograph was taken <span style="color:#E16935">ahead of time</span>. And that the statue was moved in order to make it match... That's a very interesting idea. However. There's one point that can't be denied. 
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Which is...?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
That it's only... a "possibility". Men that are trapped by the chains of "maybe"... ...can never reach their dreams!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Th-That's very true!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
N-No way! Don't fall for that, Your Honor!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Hey! Mr. DeMasque!
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Y-Yes!?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
If there's no funny business in your actions as Mask☆DeMasque... ...there should be no problem with you telling us your strategy. So let's hear it.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes. Please provide this court with your testimony. About your plan to steal the Sacred Urn!
</p>
<hr/>
<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span></center>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- The Sacred Urn Heist --</span></center>
<p>Atmey:<br/>
I first received the request from Lordly Tailor about 20 days ago.<br/>
The urn was placed in a box, and Zvarri! It was then sent to the warehouse.<br/>
Hence, I was actually unable to see the urn for myself until the day of the crime...<br/>
I knew it was an extremely valuable treasure, so I sent my card 10 days beforehand.<br/>
I then handled security by myself to ensure that my crime would go smoothly!<br/>
At last, I held the urn in my hands for the first time at 1 AM on October 12th.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Maya:<br/>
That's pretty much all stuff we've heard before, isn't it?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah, but we will find the truth hidden in the nuggets of new information he gave.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Witness... You're sure there are no mistakes this time?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
...Zvarri.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well then! Mr. Wright! You may begin your cross-examination!

Is there a problem with that calling card?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Allow me to read a passage from the calling card that Mask☆DeMasque had written. "Take good care of the <span style="color:#E16935">speckled urn</span>." Now, the "speckled" here... ...surely refers to this pink pattern on the Sacred Urn.

Truth be told, there is no way that Mask☆DeMasque could have known about this pattern.
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
What do you mean...?

This pink, spotted pattern on the urn... is actually nothing more than <span style="color:#E16935">paint stains</span>.

Paint stains...?

And yet this "calling card" clearly mentions the paint pattern. Which means... Detective Atmey had seen this urn <span style="color:#E16935">long before the crime ever took place</span>! In fact, he saw it when this fake photo was taken!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
...Phwoooooh!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
And because this photo is a fake... ...your alibi for the night of the murder no longer holds water!

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! It's so sad... No one has any conviction these days...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
C-Conviction... you say?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Yesterday, we all decided unanimously that this man was Mask☆DeMasque. And now, we're calling him a murderer... You don't think we're being a tad fickle?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Th-That's a good point!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
N-No way! Don't fall for that too, Your Honor!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
You say that Luke Atmey was the one who killed Kane Bullard? Then let me ask you this. Why would he do that?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Heh heh heh heh heh... An excellent point.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Motive, Mr. Wright! Motive! Might you my merry murderous motive manifest?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
N-Nick! He's getting his second wind!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
If he prepared an alibi and pinned his crime on Ron DeLite as you say... ...he must have had a very <span style="color:#E16935">strong motive</span> for murder!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
The only one with any motive we've seen is Ron DeLite. Isn't that right, Detective!?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Indeed. According to my own research, the boy's motive is clear!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Without a motive, it's nearly impossible to prove guilt in a murder case! Now then... Maybe you can enlighten us to what the defendant's motives were.

<p>Atmey:<br/>
I, Luke Atmey, had no points of contact with the victim whatsoever.<br/>
Kane Bullard decided to investigate Mask☆DeMasque and simply mistook who he was!<br/>
It was Mr. Bullard who wrote the blackmail letter and sent it to Ron DeLite.<br/>
And it was again Mr. Bullard who harbored a grudge against Mr. DeLite for his betrayal!<br/>
Mr. Bullard's mistake is quite excusable. The defendant truly believes he is Mask☆DeMasque.<br/>
That is why Mr. DeLite saw it fit to kill Kane Bullard. Truly a tragedy...
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
So the victim, Kane Bullard, blackmailed the defendant...?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
This is the blackmail letter found in the defendant's apartment. A handwriting test confirms that <span style="color:#E16935">Mr. Bullard was indeed the one who wrote the letter</span>.

Come now, Sir Lawyer! I'm afraid "imagination" isn't the right word for it! This is a deduction. The result of carefully applied reasoning...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Can we hear that careful reasoning for ourselves?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
... It's a long story, and better saved for another time.

Hmmm... Very well, another time.

Y-Yeah, that's right. Hopefully it won't require surgery either...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
In that case, you'll have to talk about the blackmail...

That's true. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Was that <span style="color:#E16935">blackmail letter</span> really intended for Ron?)</span>

Take a good look at this newspaper clipping. It contains a picture of the "Tear of Emanon", the <span style="color:#E16935">stolen jewel</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Wh-What about it?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The problem is this jewel's <span style="color:#E16935">color</span>.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
<span style="color:#E16935">Color</span>...? I'm not much for discussing color myself...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
According to the clipping, the color of the stolen jewel was "blue". However, in the blackmail letter, a totally different jewel is mentioned. "I'll take that <span style="color:#E16935">red diamond</span> you received the other day."
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
R-<span style="color:#E16935">Red</span>...!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Which means! The "<span style="color:#E16935">red diamond</span>" described in the blackmail letter... ...is not the "Tear of Emanon" that Mask☆DeMasque stole at all!

Hey now... Isn't that a little different from what you've been saying? You said that Kane Bullard was the one blackmailing Luke Atmey. Are you saying that Atmey was blackmailing someone else on top of that?

Ugh... You have to admit, that does sound a little odd...

It's not odd. ...It's the only thing that makes any sense. Kane Bullard was blackmailing Luke Atmey. But! <span style="color:#E16935">Ron DeLite</span> was also being blackmailed by a certain someone!
</p>

So did you start to receive blackmail letters starting after this incident...?
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
Yes. Just a few days after the "Tear of Emanon" heist...

<p>Ron:<br/>
After that, I started getting <span style="color:#E16935">the plans</span> in the mail. I received plans from some very kind person! <span style="color:#E16935">Incredibly detailed plans</span>!

"Detailed plans"... In which case, that would mean that Ron DeLite was actually Mask☆DeMasque...

That is what we are claiming. Someone else came up with the plans, and had Mr. DeLite steal his targets for him. And that someone... was none other than Luke Atmey!

SHHH! SILENCE! ... Hee hee hee hee hee... Now I see. It's all becoming clear.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh-What is?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
When you were in grade school, you received the same report card every year. "Careless, with the tendency to jump to conclusions"... Am I wrong?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
H-H-H-How did you...!?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
You say that I, Luke Atmey, was blackmailing Ron DeLite...? In which case, I would naturally know all about his relation to Mask☆DeMasque...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well, yes.
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Ron DeLite started receiving plans from his <span style="color:#E16935">second crime onward</span>, correct? Which means... I learned of his identity when he committed that first crime.

</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Unfortunately... That's as far as you go, Mr. Trite.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh-What do you mean?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
I won't allow for any more testimony... That's what I mean.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What...?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Have you forgotten? Luke Atmey is here after we interrupted his own trial. And you have failed to prove that he committed the murder! I think it's time for this witness to return to his own trial... ...and face his guilty verdict as Mask☆DeMasque.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
N-No...
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Well now, Sir Lawyer! It seems that love wins out in the end after all! I am the Ace Detective as well as Mask☆DeMasque! My verdict will verify that! Just as Ron DeLite's will verify that he is the true murderer! I declare that with the full force of my Ace Detective-ness!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order in the court! That's enough deliberation over this witness!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I-I can't believe this...! At this rate, Ron is...)</span>
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
D-Don't give up now, Nick! We still have tomorrow! We can look for more evidence and...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
By then, it'll be too late...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Huh? Wh-Why!?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
"<span style="color:#E16935">Double Jeopardy</span>"... One of the basic rules of any court of law.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
"<span style="color:#E16935">Double Jeopardy</span>"...?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
"Should a defendant be tried and <span style="color:#E16935">found innocent</span> in court... That defendant <span style="color:#E16935">cannot be tried again</span> for the same crime." This is a fundamental rule of all courts. And it applies to this witness as much as it applies to anyone else.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Mr. Atmey will be <span style="color:#E16935">found guilty</span> in a matter of minutes. Guilty as "Mask☆DeMasque". Which means...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
He will be <span style="color:#E16935">innocent</span> as far as the murder of Kane Bullard is concerned.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
No way...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The fact that you were unable to prove Mr. Atmey's guilt of that crime here... ...means that he will never again be tried as Kane Bullard's murderer.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
U... Uwaaaaaaaaaah!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Now there's nothing I can possibly do to win... Even if Ron is proclaimed to be innocent... ...the real killer, Luke Atmey, will go free.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You have cross-examined every statement the witness has made here today. And as long as there is no more testimony... I'm afraid I have to declare that there will be no further questioning of this witness! Are there any objections? Then I hereby end the cross-examination of Luke Atmey!

I think... I see it. Your Honor. When you were a child, this is what was on your report card every year. "Has poor hearing, and often makes mistakes as a result."
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
H-H-H-H-How did you...!?
</p><p>???:<br/>
...Phoenix. Raise your head up high. Have you forgotten what I used to tell you? A lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Th-That voice... No way!)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Long time no see, Phoenix.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Now... Let's do this!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
B-But...! There's nothing more we can do, Mia! Without any more testimony, I can't cross-examine...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Not yet... The testimony's not over yet.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh... What do you mean?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Your Honor! Just now you said something very interesting. "You have cross-examined every statement the witness has made here today."
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Y-Yes, that's true, but...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Unfortunately, Your Honor, you're forgetting something. Earlier, after the last cross-examination... ...this witness made a number of <span style="color:#E16935">remarks</span>!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Atmey:<br/>
Well now, Sir Lawyer! It seems that love wins out in the end after all! I am the Ace Detective as well as Mask☆DeMasque! My verdict will verify that! Just as Ron DeLite's will verify that he is the true murderer! I declare that with the full force of my Ace Detective-ness!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Y-Yes, but... These comments appear to have no importance whatso--
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Very well... Then we shall prove their importance via cross-examination. At any rate! As long as the witness has made these remarks... ...we, the defense, assert our right to question them! Is that alright with you... Prosecutor? 
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
......
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Is something the matter? Mr. Godot...
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
...! Ah, nothing.
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Oh, Sir Lawyer! It looks like you're one step too late! If you think such falsehoods will do anything to me, Luke At--
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
...Let's hear it.
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Huh...?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
It's true that the witness made some "remarks". So then... Let's hear this last bit of cross-examination.
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
M-Mr. Godot! What are you...?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
<span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [Very well then, Luke Atmey.] in the original release">Very well then.

</p><p>Mia:<br/>

</p><p>Judge:<br/>
So please, give us one last bit of testimony!
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
I... Err...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Phoenix? This is it. This is our absolute last chance.

<p>Atmey:<br/>
Indeed, it is true that I was not at Lordly Tailor.<br/>
I had to leave to see about another vitally important job request.<br/>
I had known about the date beforehand, so I had this photograph readied.<br/>
My brilliant deduction was what informed me that the true culprit was Ron DeLite.<br/>
And thanks to the Key Card and Wallet, it was abundantly clear that he was there.<br/>
I was also able to make a deduction from the buzzer, which only sounded once.<br/>
The button did not have any fingerprints on it... Why?<br/>
The victim would have left prints if he sounded it. Which means the killer sounded it.<br/>
Mr. DeLite was wearing his Mask☆DeMasque outfit, which is why he left no prints.<br/>
And, the blackmail letter? The victim likely just mistook the color of the jewel.<br/>
Zvarri! Therefore, all the evidence points to that poor boy!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This testimony actually seems to hold up pretty well...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The witness's earlier remarks do not appear to have been hastily prepared. All of his points have been explained, and none of them seem to contradict anything.
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
...But of course.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
But... How did you know about the emergency buzzer?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
The police investigation documents went directly through me... And I always look over all the documents. It's elementary, Sir Lawyer!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Grr...
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Are you going to make even more trouble for us now, Sir Lawyer...?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I will not allow any of your usual shenanigans, Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Y-Yes, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
We cannot postpone Luke Atmey's trial any longer. This is... your last chance!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
H-Hang on a sec! Just one chance...!?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! It seems that the party's about to begin.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
...Well, Phoenix?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
There isn't any evidence that contradicts with that testimony!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
...So it would seem.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh-What do you mean, "So it would seem"...?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Listen, Phoenix. Pointing out contradictions... ...doesn't always mean you have to present evidence... does it? At any rate, this is our chance. If you can't point out a <span style="color:#E16935">case-breaking contradiction</span>... ...you lose. That's all there is to it.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
...Cup number 17. The last cup. It seems like the time has come to put an end to this trial.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I have to find a <span style="color:#E16935">fatal contradiction</span> in this testimony... And... I need to point it out without presenting evidence! Which means all I can do is find the contradictory remark and <span style="color:#E16935">press</span> it...!)</span>

Remember! You only get one chance!

</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
H-How can you say that!?

Let's review your testimony, shall we, Mr. Atmey? "The button did not have any fingerprints on it... Why? Mr. DeLite was <span style="color:#E16935">wearing his Mask☆DeMasque outfit</span>." Is that correct?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
I-Indeed! That's what I said! My deductions are absolutely foolproof...

More like your deductions prove that you're a fool.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It's with that statement that I'll <span style="color:#E16935">turn this case on its head</span>!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
J-Just what are you implying!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
"Mr. DeLite saw the real killer," correct? Now, if you turn that statement around... ...it stands to follow that the <span style="color:#E16935">real killer</span> had also "<span style="color:#E16935">seen</span>" Ron DeLite!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
I-Impossible...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Detective Atmey, you saw Mask☆DeMasque at the <span style="color:#E16935">murder scene</span> that night! You saw him when you killed Kane Bullard and assaulted Ron DeLite! That was the only way you could have known what Ron was wearing!
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee! Take a good look, everyone! Unable to find a rival worthy of my genius, I was forced to create one by myself! Here I am! The tragic clown...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
...That's the same line you gave yesterday.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But... I think there's a little more meaning behind it this time.
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
What an awfully complicated incident... Kane Bullard was blackmailing Luke Atmey, who was in turn, blackmailing Ron DeLite. And upon killing his blackmailer, Luke Atmey tried to frame Ron DeLite. He then claimed to be guilty as Mask☆DeMasque in order to escape his true crime...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
And to that end, he came up with this plan... ...to use the "<span style="color:#E16935">Double Jeopardy</span>" rule when making his alibi.
</p><p>???:<br/>
Umm...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
At any rate... It would seem we've finally found the truth.
</p><p>???:<br/>
Excuse me...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I came perilously close to besmirching the record of an innocent young man... ...Besmirching him with the title of "murderer"!
</p><p>???:<br/>
...Don't ignore meeeeeee!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
...Oh. I didn't realize you were there.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why wouldn't he be...?)</span>
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
Um... About the verdict...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I know. You never committed any murder.
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
That's right! I'm so glad you understand that! But... I, um... I really am <span style="color:#E16935">Mask☆DeMaaaaasque</span>!!!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Huh?
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
So, thanks to that trial yesterday, I'm <span style="color:#E16935">innocent</span> now, right?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Uh...
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
What was it you said? "<span style="color:#E16935">Double Jeopardy</span>"?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Now that you mention it...
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
I've been careless.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Careless...?)</span> Um... What do you think, Mia?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
As the defendant says, the rule of "Double Jeopardy" is absolute. A defendant can never be tried twice for a crime in which he was once found innocent.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Then... Mask☆DeMasque is really <span style="color:#E16935">innocent</span>?

Ah! M-Mr. Wright! Um... I, uh... I don't know what to say.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Congratulations, Mr. DeLite.
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
Th-Th-Thank you so much! ... Err, no, wait. Nothing really matters anymore though, now that all of t<span style="color:grey">his has happened</span>
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Come on! Just be happy already!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Maya...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
You've been cleared of the murder charges and got off as Mask☆DeMasque to boot!
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
But, in exchange... I lost everything.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
...Huh? What do you mean?
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
Stealing security information from KB Security, becoming Mask☆DeMasque... I did it all for one reason... For her.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You mean your wife, Desirée?
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
She hates <span style="color:#E16935">criminals</span> more than anything.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Come to think of it, she was once held hostage by some robbers, wasn't she?)</span>
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
She always said how she hated sneaky criminals... I knew that. I knew that, but... Once I got fired from KB Security and lost all the money I had... ...she wouldn't have any reason to stay with me. I thought, she would leave me for sure.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So, that's why you became Mask☆DeMasque...?
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
Yes... But, it's all over now... A broken bowl can never be put back together!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Th-That's not true! Right, Nick!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Right.
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
R-Really!? Can we go back to the way things were!?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
You'll be fine! And Nick can prove it!

Hm? Oh! I only hate people who act all cowardly and sneaky. Like that detective.
