Judge:<br/>
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Ron DeLite.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The defense is ready, Your honor.
</p><p>???:<br/>
...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What about the prosecution? Are you prepared to...
</p><p>???:<br/>
...What a stupid question!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Wh-What did you say!
</p><p>???:<br/>
Fine. Let me ask you then, Your Honor. Are YOU ready? Are you ready to pass judgement?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Wh...! N-No, I... I'm not! I will pass judgement after I hear arguments from both sides.
</p><p>???:<br/>
Well, if you're not ready yourself, you shouldn't expect others to be. That's a rule to live by.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
...Um, wh-who are you?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
I am Godot. Legendary prosecutor. I've never lost a case.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Ah! He's the one that Detective Atmey was talking about...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes, your reputation precedes you. What kind of cases have you dealt with so far?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! None.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What did you say...?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
I've never prosecuted a case before.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
N-Never? But you said you've never lost before.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
...Exactly. I've never lost. I've never won before either.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Quite arrogant for a beginner, aren't you?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Even the mightiest of redwoods begin their lives as mere saplings.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes, but... A mask? In a court of law?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! Don't you know anything? No matter the man, we all wear masks... Either on our faces or ever our hearts.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
This guy is the real deal alright, Nick...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why does it seem like all prosecutors are the "real deal"...?)</span>
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
So we finally meet... Mr. Phoenix Trite!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
N-Nick! Is he a friend of yours?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
No. I don't have any friends that call me "Trite". <span style="color:#0070C0">(Just who is this masked man...?)</span>
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
I've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well then, err, Prosecutor Gobo.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
It's not "Gobo". It's Godot... Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
In any case, please give your opening statement.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Opening statement? Those things are not fit for even dogs to consume. I have only one thing to say before we start. To you... Mr. Trite.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh-What is it?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Are you familiar with the saying, "A chain is only as strong as its weakest link"? I wonder... how much you can withstand before you and your case break in two...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... Well then, let's hear from the first witness!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Um, my name is...
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
No one asked for your name, witness.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
...Urk.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
The important thing is what you know... That's all. Start talking. ...We're listening.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Y-Yes, sir.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Alright, witness. First, let's hear about... What you know about the thief that stole the urn.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yes, sir!

<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span></center>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- Mask☆DeMasque's Crimes --</span></center>
<p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Mask☆DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 months ago.<br/>
He's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime!<br/>
This was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor.<br/>
His pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces.<br/>
That's why we're sure it was Mask☆DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... So then the actual identity of this Mask☆DeMasque is... <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [M-Mr. Godot!

</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Blacker than a moonless night, hotter and more bitter than Hell itself... That is coffee. I'm sure you can grant me at least this much... Your Honor. Oh, please. Proceed.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
... Very well. It's only coffee, after all.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What!? You can't be letting him slide this early in the trial!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Proceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Well, Nick? What are you going to do?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
As long as they haven't brought up Mr. DeLite's identity... ...all we can do is show that it <span style="color:#E16935">wasn't Mask☆DeMasque who stole the urn.</span>

Have you seen all of these so-called "calling cards"?

Of course I have. Except... The person in charge of the Treasure Exhibit never brought their card to the police... So I didn't see this one until after the crime occurred.

That's because Detective Atmey stopped Ms. Andrews from taking it to the police.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Was the calling card that Lordly Tailor received authentic?

Well, all the cards have <span style="color:#E16935">one common, identifying feature</span>. But we're not releasing that information to the general public...

What's that? Some kind of especially salty teardrop?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
N-No, sir. It's a blue diamond. A single, rare diamond. Next was the "Crown of Bongora"... You know, the thing you put on your head. After that was the "Left Hand of Hades" and then the "Portrait of Mejeena", sir. Detective Atmey retrieved the "Portrait of Mejeena" and returned it to the museum.

What do you mean when you say, "it fits his M. O. to a T"?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I was thinking of asking the same thing myself.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Ugh... I wish you would listen a little more closely, pal. First of all, there's the calling card. We're 100% certain it's authentic. Then there's the fact that he seemed to know all about the security system. And finally, his target was an art piece. These are all part of the thief's modus operandi.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
And so, since this robbery seems to fit all those conditions...?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
That's right! It means that Mask☆DeMasque is behind it!

Nick! It definitely looks like it was Mask☆DeMasque who stole the urn!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But there's no real evidence either way as to whether Ron DeLite is Mask☆DeMasque.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
But... But...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Also, the urn hasn't turned up yet, let alone in connection to Mr. DeLite himself.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
So even though we know it was Mask☆DeMasque that did it...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Maybe for the time being, I should try to show it wasn't Mask☆DeMasque that did it!)</span>
</p>

<p>Phoenix:<br/>
...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
...Just hearing the "little" in that question is making me nervous.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You said that he always "goes after the most precious art pieces", right?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
That's right, pal.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But there's one problem... That's not what he did in this case. The supposedly "priceless" urn doesn't exactly rise to the level of "precious art"!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Wh-What do you mean!?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
N-Nick! How can you say such a terrible thing!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
No! I meant from a financial point of view! I mean, it wouldn't fetch a good price.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well, Prosecutor Godot? What is the value of that urn?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
The appraisers I spoke to said they couldn't attach a price to it. And I mean that in the worst sense.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So in other words... It was <span style="color:#E16935">not the kind of item</span> that Mask☆DeMasque would <span style="color:#E16935">normally go after</span>!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Urk!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... If I understand you correctly, Mr. Wright... ...you're saying that the theft of the Sacred Urn was <span style="color:#E16935">not the work of Mask☆DeMasque</span>...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Y-Yes... That's what I'm saying. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Actually all I did was point out the contradiction. The argument made itself, but...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well... First of all, we need to get this issue cleared up. Was this last robbery the work of Mask☆DeMasque or not? What do you have to say about this, Mr. Godot?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
This coffee here... It's my own special blend. I call it Godot #107. I'm trying to decide whether to cut down on the acidity or the bitterness... That's the only thing I've got on my mind right now... ...Mr. Trite!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh-What!?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
If you're really a man, you should clean up your own mess.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Umm... Sorry, but I didn't get what you mean.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
If you're saying it wasn't Mask☆DeMasque that stole the urn... ...then it must be someone imitating Mask☆DeMasque's methods... A <span style="color:#E16935">fake</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
A-A <span style="color:#E16935">Fake☆DeMasque</span>?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Fake☆DeMasque? That sounds so ridiculous. ...But I like it.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Now, before I decide on my coffee, I believe some proof is in order, Mr. Trite. Proof that the person who appeared at Lordly Tailor that night was actually a <span style="color:#E16935">fake</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... Though I don't approve of Mr. Godot's behavior, his point is valid. Mr. Wright. ...We're waiting.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It looks like I'm going to have to prove it... I need proof that the person at Lordly Tailor that night was in fact, <span style="color:#E16935">Fake☆DeMasque</span>!)</span>

I have here a piece of reference I would like the court to take a look at.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Isn't that the publicity photo I bought this morning...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The problem I have with the security camera photo is the <span style="color:#E16935">broach</span> on DeMasque's chest.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
A Breach? Here!? Bailiff! Get my steed! We need to retreat at once!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...A broach, Your Honor. It's a sort of clasp for holding one's cape on.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
A clasp, eh... Ah! I see now!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
But the Mask☆DeMasque in the security camera photo... Ahh!! He has no <span style="color:#E16935">broach</span>!!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That broach is the same as the emblem on DeMasque's calling card and serves as his symbol. But the thief that broke into Lordly Tailor wasn't wearing a broach... In other words, this "Mask☆DeMasque" is a fake!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
...! I-I've been fooled agaaaaaain!

Well I've always had a good nose for evidence... I got it at the crime scene. It was hidden in the shadow of a big female Buddha statue.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">("<span style="color:#E16935">Buddha statue</span>"...? He must mean the Ami Fey statue.)</span>

...I always put evidence away in my pocket. ...After all, it's the safest place for crucial evidence.

Grrr... This guy is one cool customer.

It's a little early to be shaken up, isn't it, little lady? ...That friend of yours left pretty little <span style="color:#E16935">hickeys</span> on there, too.

H-Hickeys?

What!? The defendant's fingerprints are on the broach!? Order! Order in the court! Mr. Godot! Let's see that broach!

I've grown attached to my metallic girlfriend here. ...Take good care of her.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... She-- I mean, it appears to have been <span style="color:#E16935">torn</span> off some clothing. There's a little bit of cloth left on the back.

...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! What we have here is... A judge and a prosecutor. ...A coffee maniac, at that! ...Am I correct?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
W-Well, yes. That's right.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! Not bad. Not bad at all. You're the first person that's ever been able to penetrate my secret veil.
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Well, Sir Prosecutor. Let me introduce myself. My name is Luke Atmey, Ace Detective and rising star illuminating the heavens.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Boy, these two make a perfect pair...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
They'd either be best friends or they'd tear each other's heads off.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I've heard that on the night of the crime, you were all alone on security detail.
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
...You have heard correctly. My specially-made monocle is worth more than a hundred Detective Gumshoes. ...If Detective Gumshoe was worth anything, that is.

<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- What I Witnessed --</span></center>
<p>Atmey:<br/>
It was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed.<br/>
That's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask☆DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me!<br/>
Just as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!<br/>
Darkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone.<br/>
Thirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
So you didn't get a clear look at the criminal?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
My specially-made monocle never misses a thing. However! That is limited to things that fall within my own visual range! But of course, that's only natural.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
...I fall to see why the witness seems so proud of his performance that evening.
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Well, Sir Old-Timer, let me explain. We are not speaking of any ordinary thief... ...but of the kings of thieves! The great Mask☆DeMasque, my arch-enemy! That is what my instincts and my years of experience tell me!

That's an impressive deduction, Sir Lawyer.

You were on security duty that night. Where exactly were you at the time?

A penetrating question! I was in the basement warehouse, near the computer.

Gumshoe also said that he never saw him at the crime scene...

Precisely! That is precisely why I chose NOT to hide last night. I knew that by NOT concealing myself, I would be putting pressure on the thief.

...Mr. Atmey. Could you take a look at this with that special monocle of yours?

Aha! This belongs to the criminal mastermind, my arch-nemesis, Mask☆DeMasque! It is, in point of fact, Mask☆DeMasque's broach!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It was found on the floor of the basement warehouse. I wonder how that happened?
</p><p>Atmey:<br/>
Ha... Elementary, my dear lawyer. Obviously it wasn't glued on well enough.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Not quite. It clearly shows <span style="color:#E16935">signs of having been ripped off</span> a piece of clothing.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Ripped off...? Aha!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...We can only deduce that the thief <span style="color:#E16935">struggled</span> with someone that night! That's the only thing I can think of.

Hee hee hee he he he... I just remembered, Your Honor. I was just confused because I've been dealing with so many cases lately.

The true measure of a man is in the amount of work he does. That's what I always say.

Nick, you can only handle one case at a time... Isn't that right?

</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! Pathetic...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Godot...? Do you have something you wish to say?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Yes, Your Honor... It simply amazes me how quickly times change... In the old days, a man was to be taken at his word. It's truly sad...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You're still denying that Mr. Atmey was involved!?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Before casting aspersions at Detective Atmey, consider the young lady here. Your name is Desirée... Desirée DeLite. Is that correct?
</p><p>Desirée:<br/>
Y-Yes! What about it?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! How charming... The lengths that a woman is willing to go to save her husband is truly inspiring.
</p><p>Desirée:<br/>
Wh-What are you insinuating!?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
As the wife of the criminal, you could have "<span style="color:#E16935">discovered</span>" that stolen urn anywhere. Including the office of the good detective here. So you found the urn. What does that prove? It certainly doesn't prove where the urn was before you "found" it.
</p><p>Desirée:<br/>
What...? I just brought it here from the detective's office!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Please Madame... This town is already filled to the brim with lies. Any more could only compound the tragedy we have been witness to.
</p><p>Desirée:<br/>
You're wrong! I would never...! I would never do such a thing!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Ms. DeLite...
</p><p>Desirée:<br/>
Please, Nicky boy! You've got to help me talk some sense into these people!

If that's the case, then why did you ever start thieving to begin with?
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
Well, Dessie is crazy about shopping. She's a real shopaholic... But she's the love of my life, Your Honor. I guess you could say I'm a "Dessie-aholic"...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... So you do have a complicated family situation after all.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...Alright, that's enough. Please continue with your testimony. I beg of you.

Mr. DeLite... When did you first notice that you'd lost your wallet?

Err, let's see... I think it was on the night of the crime... But I know I still had it when Dessie and I went out for dinner.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
This wallet was found at approximately <span style="color:#E16935">1:00 AM</span> at KB Security headquarters.

What...!? Surely you're not serious!?

Noooooo!

So if the defendant was at KB Security at 1 o'clock in the morning... ...then that proves that he has a watertight alibi!

Noooooo!

Look, it's just ridiculous! Why would I have dropped my wallet at KB Security!? Someone must have planted it there to make it LOOK like I was there and not at the heist.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
"Planted it there"? He's really reaching now...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Mr. DeLite. You probably dropped your wallet when you took it out to use this, didn't you? The key card to KB Security's <span style="color:#E16935">CEO's office</span>.
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
Noooo!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! That was a pretty good try, Mr. Trite... Unfortunately, you've overlooked one small thing.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh-What...?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
"<span style="color:#E16935">Motive</span>" of course! Why would this thief go to KB Security in the middle of the night anyway!?

Mr. DeLite... I believe you've seen this before, correct?
</p><p>Ron:<br/>
Ah...! Th-That's...!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What is it?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
A <span style="color:#E16935">blackmail letter</span>. That's what it looks like from the contents.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
B-Blackmail...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes, basically it says, "bring $50,000 dollars". <i>[sic]</i>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... That certainly sounds like blackmail alright...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
At the time of the theft, Mr. DeLite was <span style="color:#E16935">dealing with the blackmailer</span> himself... ...in KB Security's CEO office, a full half an hour away from the scene of the crime!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
...Ungh... Urk... No No No No No NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! OOOOORDER!! So when the theft of the urn occurred, the defendant was at KB Security... It looks like a perfect case for the defense!

...You may see it as a perfect case, Judge, but to me... Well, let's just say that my Godot Blend #107 impresses me a lot more.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh-What are you trying to say?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
You say the thief was being blackmailed by the CEO of a security company... But... Did you actually investigate this CEO at all?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh!? Well, umm... No... I guess not.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Accusing a man of blackmail with no proof? I'm not sure what I think of that...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">("Not sure what I think of that"...? At least I know what I think of you...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... Good point. I'm not sure what I think of it myself... You claim that the defendant <span style="color:#E16935">entered the CEO's office</span>... ...but you will need at least one <span style="color:#E16935">witness</span> to corroborate your claim, Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Nick! I think we're going to have to track down the CEO guy...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
No, we don't have to track down the CEO at all.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
What do you mean by that, Mr. Trite?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
There is <span style="color:#E16935">someone else</span> who can testify. <span style="color:green">This is the person who can testify <span style="color:#E16935">that the key card was used</span> at 1 AM that night!</span>

<p>Judge:<br/>
Wh-Who is this useless-looking young man?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You don't remember him, Your Honor?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmmmm... Not exactly... But just looking at his picture makes the bile start to rise in my throat.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
It looks like he doesn't remember the case from 2 years ago...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
He probably blocked out that memory on purpose. Anyway, this man was working as a guard at KB Security that night.
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Oh...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The question at hand is this key card.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Butz:<br/>
Yup. That's the key card they use at the building I work in. According to the serial number, this one is for the <span style="color:#E16935">CEO's office</span>. You need it to get into that room, and every time you use that card, it leaves a <span style="color:#E16935">record</span>.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
As you can see, there's no need to investigate the CEO of KB Security! We should be able to discover the truth simply by analyzing this key card's data!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Bwaaaah...!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Well, Mr. Godot?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
The name of the CEO of KB Security is Kane Bullard. I was unable to contact him directly, but... I got the key card data. ...Here.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
S-So what does it show!?
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Each key card has its own serial number and they leave detailed records of their use. According to this data... this card was used at <span style="color:#E16935">1 AM</span> on the morning of the crime.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Key Card updated in the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
But that means... it <span style="color:#E16935">can't be</span> Mr. DeLite dressed as Mask☆DeMasque in this photo!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ha...! It looks like you're right. Two minutes isn't even enough time to brew a good cup o' Joe...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So... So then...!
</p><p>Godot:<br/>
Ron DeLite was clearly <span style="color:#E16935">in the office of KB Security's CEO</span> at the time of the crime. ...The prosecutor's office is ready to admit that <span style="color:#E16935">fact</span>. Therefore, it's impossible for the defendant to be Mask☆DeMasque.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Good job! You did it, Nick!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
...That's enough! I came perilously close to besmirching the record of an innocent young man. Besmirching him with the title of "thief"! ...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh-What's wrong, Your Honor?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I'm ready to pass judgement... But before I do that, do you have any further objections?

No, Your Honor!
