		{"Judge": "A-And how do you do that?"},
		{"Dahlia": "Even when the body dies, the spirit, the ego , it lives on... forever. I wanted to take away the person that Mia Fey loved most. I wanted to kill her with my own hands! That would be the one and only way I could take my revenge against Mia Fey! That was the reason I helped out with that woman's plans!"},
		{"Phoenix": "Just for that!? For that you would kill Maya!? Your goal was no different than that of Morgan Fey!"},
		{"Judge": "... As they say, \"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.\" What a cruel plan... Cruel, cold, and heartless."},
		{"Dahlia": "...Hmph! Don't waste your time preaching to the dead. I've already told you, there's not a thing you can do to me."},
		{"Phoenix": "Grrrr...!"},
		{"Dahlia": "That night... ...at about 9:30 PM, I materialized into this world. I quickly pinned my hair up and put on a demon-warding hood. Then I picked up the staff that was by my side and left Hazakura Temple."},

		{"Dahlia": "...That ridiculous head nun never noticed a thing. She left Maya Fey at the Inner Temple... ...and wobbled back clutching her poor old back."},

		{"Phoenix": "That's not like her at all! Maya wouldn't stab a French fry with a plastic fork!"},
		{"Dahlia": "Anyway, I suddenly lost consciousness... But before I did... I scrawled her name on the lantern. Just as I was passing out, I wrote \" Maya \" behind my back. I had hoped it would cast suspicion on her."},

		{"Dahlia": "...That's where my memory temporarily stops."},
		{"Judge": "It-It stops ...?"},
		{"Dahlia": "I don't have any memory of actually killing Maya Fey with my own two hands . My very last memory was... ...Maya's terror-filled eyes. When I woke up after that... ...I was in the Sacred Cavern surrounded by darkness."},
		{"Judge": "You were in the Sacred Cavern?"},
		{"Dahlia": "...The entrance was sealed with one of those trick locks. Somehow I had been trapped in there."},
		{"Godot": "But how did you wind up in there?"},
		{"Dahlia": "...I'd like to know that myself. Anyway, I was worried... I didn't know whether or not Maya Fey was dead... And I swore I wouldn't return to the underworld until I knew I had killed her myself."},
		{"Godot": "Hmm... For a ghost, you're one tough cookie..."},
		{"Dahlia": "I wanted to get out of there and make sure she was dead. But... I couldn't do it. I couldn't get out."},

		{"Judge": "So then you're saying... ...you were actually confined against your will inside this Sacred Cavern...?"},
		{"Dahlia": "Yes! I wanted to get rid of that annoying lock as soon as possible... But it wasn't easy. I kept getting interrupted while I was working on it."},
		{"Phoenix": "Interrupted...?"},

		{"Judge": "What!? Who!?"},
		{"Phoenix": "Could it have been... Maya!?"},
		{"Dahlia": "I thought the same thing. But I couldn't see."},
		{"Phoenix": "Why not!?"},
		{"Dahlia": "If someone had spotted me, I would have lost my chance to take revenge. ...So I made sure to hide myself well at the back of the Sacred Cavern."},
		{"Phoenix": "( That morning... only two people could have gone into the Training Hall. Maya and... Pearls... Pearls went there to cover the hanging scroll in gravy. )"},
		{"Dahlia": "Still, I finally managed to remove the lock. But... I was too late."},
		{"Godot": "What do you mean by that?"},
		{"Dahlia": "...The flies had already started to gather."},
		{"Godot": "The bridge had been fixed and the police had started their investigation, correct?"},
		{"Dahlia": "Naturally, I couldn't go out. So instead... I returned to the cavern and put the lock back on myself. I realized I wouldn't get a chance to see Maya's corpse as I had hoped... But just then... Lady Luck showed up."},
		{"Phoenix": "Lady Luck ...?"},
		{"Dahlia": "After that big earthquake... she showed up, all by herself."},
		{"Phoenix": "...The real Iris?"},
		{"Dahlia": "She said she'd come to make sure the Sacred Cavern was alright... Stupid girl. I came out from the Sacred Cavern and got a feel for the situation. ...And I locked her away in my place. I had finally learned exactly what had happened... It was then that I learned that the plan had actually succeeded."},
		{"Phoenix": "What do you mean your plan had succeeded ?"},
		{"Dahlia": "I had misunderstood one thing, you see. That night, the one that had summoned me... I had assumed that it was Pearl Fey."},
		{"Judge": "W-Well of course you would've assumed that. It was written in the instructions."},
		{"Dahlia": "But... I was wrong. The person that had actually called my spirit back was... Misty Fey ... The picture book author..."},
		{"Judge": "Wh... Whaaaaaaat!?"},
		{"Dahlia": "Well, that's really the only possibility, isn't it? After I lost consciousness in the garden... ...it was her body that was left lying there... Maya Fey... I wasn't able to kill her with my own hands after all. But even so... I made her commit the most vile sin a human can commit."},
		{"Judge": "And that is...?"},
		{"Dahlia": "Matricide. The sin of killing her own mother!"},
		{"Phoenix": "Ugggh... NOOOO WAY!!"},
		{"Judge": "Or-Order! Order in the court! What is the meaning of this!?"},

		{"Dahlia": "...The fact that Maya Fey has disappeared is evidence enough, isn't it?"},
		{"Phoenix": "Huh...?"},
		{"Dahlia": "The idea that she's still in the Sacred Cavern is just ridiculous. She wasn't able to escape from the Inner Temple, that much is obvious. In that case, there is only one place she could be."},

		{"Godot": "Ea-Eagle River...!?"},
		{"Dahlia": "Maya Fey killed her long-lost mother. Can you imagine the guilt she must have felt when she realized that? That's why she threw herself into the Eagle River. Most bodies that wind up in there are lost forever. So, what do you have to say now... Feenie?"},
