<p><br/>
Judge:<br/>
Court is now in session for the trial of Matt Engarde.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Now, as I recall, we concluded yesterday's session with a big mystery on our hands. The mystery being what exactly was Ms. Adrian Andrews' role in this murder? That is to say, is she really connected to the crime itself? Mr. Edgeworth, if you would please inform the court of today's proceedings.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Adrian Andrews. She forged evidence that threw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, and then proceeded to escape the crime scene by wearing a Nickel Samurai costume. The guilt of these actions are those from which she cannot escape.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm, then you're saying that she is guilty after all...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I'm not finished, Your Honor. Ms. Andrews has nothing to do with committing the actual murder.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I would like to direct the court's attention to this card.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What is that...? It looks like a shell...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
This is the calling card of a certain assassin.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
<span style="color:#E16935">A-Assassin</span>, you say!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Yes, Juan Corrida was killed by a professional assassin! And the person who hired the assassin, his client so to speak, is Matt Engarde!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Wh-What a surprising turn of events!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I would think it's become commonplace by now, Your Honor.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I know what's going on this time... So I know that everything Edgeworth has said is true...)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
But we still have to hold out as long as we can. At least, until Maya's safe and sound.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I wonder how the trial will turn out today...?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Now then, please call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The prosecution calls the defendant's "mentor", Mr. Will Powers to the stand.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Now then, witness. Your name and occupation, please.
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
O-OK. I'm... Uh... Will Powers. I'm a poor, underpaid action star...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
And what is your relation to the defendant?
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
Well, that's... I guess I'm sort of a lousy mentor to him in a way. Yeah.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Um, Mr. Powers. Please... You don't need to put yourself down so much.
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
Oh, uh, sorry. Well, but I'm just kind of a nothing sort of guy.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
On the night of the murder, you visited the defendant's room. Is this correct?
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
Y-Yes.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(I... I didn't know that...)</span>
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
Um, but you know... I didn't actually get to see Matt when I went...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
All you need to do is answer what you're asked. Now then, I would like you to please testify about when you went to Mr. Engarde's room.
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
O-OK... Sure...
</p>
<hr/>
<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span></center>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- Visit to Matt's Room --</span></center>
<p>Powers:<br/>
After the award ceremony, I went by myself to Matt's room.<br/>
Matt was standing there in front of his room, still in his Nickel Samurai costume.<br/>
He was talking with someone. At first, I thought it was the bellboy.<br/>
I watched the two of them for a while, but then I gave up and went back.<br/>
I had guests with me that night, and I couldn't make them wait for me.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... Nothing sounds out of place in Mr. Powers' testimony.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(And talking with the bellboy is no big deal...)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
If one assumes that the person Mr. Engarde was speaking with was an ordinary bellboy...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Wh-What are you implying?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Well, Mr. Wright. Let's have your cross-examination, shall we?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Looks like we're in another sticky situation.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
A trap. Can't you smell it, Phoenix? But for us to find out more, we're just going to have to charge in head first, right?

<p>Mia:<br/>
In any case, if that bellboy was the assassin, it would be very bad for us.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But... he really is the assassin, you know?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Yes... But. You can't give in yet. If you want to prolong this trial for as long as possible, you're going to have to pull some cheap tricks on this one.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
Mr. Powers.
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
Y-Y-Yes?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You're easily influenced by other people's words, aren't you? As soon as you heard that the bellboy might have been the killer, you got caught up in believing it must be true.
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
But... But... Isn't he really suspicious!? He's got all those stitches, and... and...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So? A baseball has stitches! Are you saying all baseballs are suspicious because they have stitches!?
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
*gulp!* Well, there's also... I mean, what about him being empty-handed!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I would like to ask the court to please take a look here.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
This is... the crime scene...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
There is a wine glass sitting next to Mr. Corrida's body. The liquid inside this glass is tomato juice. And now, if you would look at what is on top of the table in the lower right corner here... Anyone can clearly see that it is a <span style="color:#E16935">tray</span> with a <span style="color:#E16935">bottle of tomato juice</span> on it! The bellboy had just brought this to Mr. Corrida's room. He left the tray in the room, which is why he was empty-handed when he left!
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
Aah!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
B-But! That would mean that the bellboy had seen and left a dead body in the room!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Ah, but can you prove that Mr. Corrida was already dead at that time?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Uh... M-Mr. Edgeworth!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...Yes?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I-I blame you for leading me down this route!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Heh heh heh. I'm terribly sorry...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What is with him? Why is he laughing??)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Witness. Isn't there one more thing you would like to share with us?
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
I-Is there?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The bellboy was empty-handed... Or should I say empty-"<span style="color:#E16935">hand</span>"ed? I recall you had something interesting to say about his hands...
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
Oh yeah! I almost forgot!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh? Wh-What...?
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
That bellboy -- he was wearing <span style="color:#E16935">gloves</span>!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Gloves?
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
Yeah, pitch black, leather ones. All the other bellboys don't wear gloves like that, right?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Black leather gloves... Why didn't you mention them earlier!?
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
S-Sorry... It slipped my mind.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Argh! Boy does this make the bellboy look really suspicious... Alright, got to focus. I can't get lax here!)</span> So what if he had gloves? A lot of bellboys wear gloves!
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
Come on, Mr. Wright! That bellboy was wearing black leather ones!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So? A football is made of leather! Are you saying all footballs are suspicious because they are made of leather!?
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
*gulp!*
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
But that man... He received a large <span style="color:#E16935">roll of cash</span> from the defendant. And then he was seen leaving the crime scene wearing <span style="color:#E16935">black leather gloves</span>. I don't think that even someone like myself can believe he was just another bellboy...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Urgh...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It seems that we have finally come to an understanding... Now then, witness. Please continue with the rest of your testimony.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The rest...?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Oh yes, please tell us more.
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
OK!

After leaving Juan's room, the bellboy went and knocked on Matt's door, just like that.<br/>
He gave something to the person inside the room.<br/>
Then the old guy just left, without even going into the room.<br/>
After that, I went to the bathroom and then back to my seat.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
So the bellboy, after leaving the crime scene, next went to the defendant's room...?
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
Yeah. I kinda saw all that by accident...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Some accident! I'd say you saw too much! And all of it was suspicious to high heaven...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... I think it's safe to say that we can no longer consider this bellboy to be "normal". Now then, let's get started, shall we? Mr. Wright, your cross-examination, please.

Yes, Your Honor...

Yes, yes! It was just like that!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Edgeworth. Is all this really that important?

Of course, Your Honor. I think this is of the utmost importance. This is when whatever was removed from the crime scene was handed over to the client!

It's a little troublesome, isn't it? But I'm sure if you press him enough, everything will become clearer. Although, that just makes it harder on us, doesn't it?

What is it, Phoenix?

I have a feeling that something bad is going to happen once I show this...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Wright! If you have something to say, please spit it out!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Y-Yes, Your Honor. <span style="color:#0070C0">(OK Phoenix, deep breath...)</span> Mr. Powers. The "something" you saw... Was it this item?
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
Oh, hey! That's it! That's the something! Wow, Mr. Wright. You really figured it out.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Hmm, I recall we found this at Matt Engarde's mansion...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
At the d-defendant's house!? What does this mean!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It's simple, Your Honor. Shelly de Killer assassinated Juan Corrida in his room. And then he stole this wooden bear from the scene of the crime.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Then, the bear being found at Mr. Engarde's mansion would mean...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It goes without saying, Your Honor. Mr. Matt Engarde is De Killer's client!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! Order! ...I said ORDER!!! Mr. Wright. This is a most unfortunate turn of events for you.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah... Sorry, Mia.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
No, it's alright. Your judgment was sound. Actually, I figured the bear would come up. If not now, then it would have later on. Even if you hadn't shown it to the court, I'm sure your friend Edgeworth would've.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

There are still a few points left that we have not fully explored!

Yes. We already know that she tried to frame Matt Engarde for the crime... By wearing a spare Nickel Samurai costume!

Hmm...
</p><p>...What is with this trial...?<br/>
...Come on. Anyone can tell Engarde did it...<br/>

<span style="color:#0070C0">(He's right... De Killer did specially bring that bear to Engarde right away...)</span> Why do you ask? Is there something special about it?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Absolutely. And I'm sure that once the court knows its significance, the <span style="color:#E16935">true killer's identity</span> will become crystal clear. Your Honor! The prosecution calls upon a witness who will clear all doubts against Ms. Andrews.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>

It's quite simple, Your Honor. Ms. Adrian Andrews herself.

This is most definitely the note she left right before she committed suicide!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
O-ORDER! Witness! Did you know about this...?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
...Yes, I did. I heard all about it from Juan. When I discovered his body... I looked for the bear. I wanted to destroy the note before it became public. But... I couldn't find it anywhere.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Because it had already been taken by De Killer.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Everything is going at Mr. Edgeworth's pace... So now that the suicide note has been found, what's the next logical question?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
"What is written on the note...?"
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
That's right... At least, that's what I would think...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Now then, I believe it is only appropriate the contents of this note be made known.
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
I can't stop you, can I...? I went through so much... just to get my hands on it. And I was going to burn it... for her sake.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I'm deeply sorry, but I can't allow you to persuade me to stop. Your Honor. If you could please read the contents of this note aloud.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well...
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
The judge's voice rang loud and clear though the dead silent courtroom... In her note, Celeste Inpax left to us a record of all that had happened to her... About being used and then thrown away by Engarde... About being engaged to Corrida, and Engarde's role in destroying that... And about how she decided, in her despair, to end it all.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
... And that's all Ms. Inpax had to say.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
There is one thing I would like to say here. The prosecution has no interest in slandering Mr. Engarde.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Then... What...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Our intention, Your Honor, is to establish a <span style="color:#E16935">motive for murder</span>. Isn't that correct, witness?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Yes... On the night of the murder, Juan was going to make the contents of the note public. After the post-ceremony show... he was going to hold a press conference.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
My word...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Matt Engarde values, above all else, his "refreshing like a spring breeze" image. Which is why he had to stop this note from being made public... At any cost!
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Celeste's Suicide Note added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>...It's Engarde's fault that woman killed herself...<br/>
...And this time, he even went so far as to kill someone to stop him from revealing that!<br/>
...How terrible...! What a selfish person...!<br/>
I guess there are slimeball lawyers out there who will defend these creeps too!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
<span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [There is no margin for doubt here.] in the original release">There is no room for doubt here.</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [There is no margin for doubt here.] in the original release)</span> Mr. de Killer's client's goal was to obtain this <span style="color:#E16935">suicide note</span>. And the only person who needed this note that badly is the <span style="color:#E16935">defendant</span>. Let's not forget that the bear with the note inside was found at the defendant's house!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
It seems that we have come to the truth at last. The defendant's motives were entirely selfish. He deserves no sympathy from anyone!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Urk... <span style="color:#0070C0">(How am I supposed to escape from this one!?)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Why the hesitation, Phoenix? Gumshoe hasn't called yet, so you know what you must do.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I know. I have to carry on and buy him some more time! OK. There are 2 deadly pieces of evidence: the figurine and the suicide note. Maybe somehow, I can find a way out of this situation through one of those!)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
The gavel is already in the judge's hand! Phoenix! Hurry!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The suicide note or the figurine!? Which one of these should I pursue??)</span>

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I think Your Honor believes that Matt Engarde killed in order to obtain this note.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes, that is correct.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But that seems a little strange. In fact, I think there is a contradiction here!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
This note was hidden by Mr. Corrida until the night of the murder. If that is the case... I say that Matt Engarde could not have known what was written on this note!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Oh! I didn't think of it that way...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Exactly. But I did think of it that way, and I thought it was rather strange. No one in their right mind would kill for a note without first knowing what it said!

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The assassin took this with him from the crime scene after murdering Mr. Corrida. At the request of his client, of course.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
So, what's your point, Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I don't think it's possible that Mr. de Killer's client was Matt Engarde. In fact, I think there is a contradiction here!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You can't tell by just looking at it that this bear is really a jewelry box. The chances that Matt Engarde thought the note was inside this bear... Are zero to none!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Oh! I didn't think of it that way...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Exactly. But I did think of it that way, and I thought it was rather strange. After all, there is no reason why Mr. Engarde would ever want a jewelry box like this!

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It was just a flash, but I think I did rather well on this one...)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Unfortunately... I think he believes differently.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I believe a show of appreciation is in order.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
H-Huh?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The defense seems to be in love with wishing more despair upon itself.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I would like to direct the court's attention to this.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What is that...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It is a very small video camera, Your Honor. This type of camera is commonly used as a means of <span style="color:#E16935">spying</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
S-Spying...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What the...!? I thought that spy camera was in <span style="color:#E16935">my possession</span>...)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Matt Engarde and the victim both thought of the other as their biggest rival. They even went so far as to use this type of item to find each other's weaknesses!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
And...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The victim, Juan Corrida, was being spied on! His personal life was being watched by none other than Matt Engarde!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Oooooorder!! Ahem! Mr. Wright!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Y-Yes, Your Honor?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You... Don't tell me you knew about your client's spying activities!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well... sort of...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
"Sort of" is not an acceptable answer, Mr. Wright!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I see you are confused, Mr. Wright. You're probably thinking, "But I have the camera that was in the stuffed bear's eye..."
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
But this camera that I have is not that same one. Last night, I searched the <span style="color:#E16935">victim's house</span> on a hunch... Using this...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Gumshoe's bug sweeper...)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
By the way, Mr. Wright. The defendant's <span style="color:#E16935">fingerprints</span> were found on this camera.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Matt Engarde's fingerprints were on there!?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Well, Phoenix... It looks like those cameras were hidden all over the place, huh?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What am I supposed to say to that evidence...?)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I think this is the end. It's fairly obvious that Mr. Engarde learned of the suicide note through this. He was watching the victim all along.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He got me good this time! I don't have anything to counter that!)</span>
</p><p>...Hey, hey... Now what's that lawyer thinking...?<br/>
...Mommy? Is that man the bad killer guy?<br/>
...Shush! Stop! Don't look at him!<br/>

</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Phoenix...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes, Chief!?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What I'm going to do next!? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Does running away like a frightened child work?)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
I know it seems like Mr. Edgeworth is very close to putting the lid on this case. But... In his eagerness to prove his point, he forgot one very <span style="color:#E16935">important thing</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well, what is it, Mia!?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
There is a piece of evidence that he really should <span style="color:#E16935">investigate</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Something he should <span style="color:#E16935">investigate</span>?)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
I would really hate to see the good prosecutor get scolded... For not remembering to look into the item when he had the chance.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why are you speaking in riddles all of a sudden...?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Alright, I think this time we finally understand everything. Well, Mr. Wright? You don't have any further objections, do you?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What is this <span style="color:#E16935">piece of evidence</span> that Mia is talking about...? Can I figure out what it is that still needs to be looked at, or should I let it go...?)</span>

For what purpose?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
We can perform the necessary tests on this piece of evidence in that time!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... But can you really obtain your results in 30 minutes?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I believe we can, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
But wouldn't it be better if we adjourned for today and then reconvened tomorrow...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Thirty minutes. Please, Your Honor. That's all I am asking for.

Please! Your Honor!

It sounded like he had an accident. I'm guessing his cell phone broke as well.

Wh-What was he thinking?? We've got to hurry and call for help!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
But we have no idea where he is. His cell phone is broken, and he wasn't driving a patrol car, so no radio either. Also... If we don't get to those items before they do, the police will take possessions of them.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
No! We can't let that happen!

Mr. C-Corrida...?

Well, well... It looks like Ms. Inpax never left a suicide note after all. She never wrote anything about Engarde...

However! Your Honor. Even though this suicide note is indeed a fake, Mr. Engarde could not have known that, and so that <i>[sic]</i> facts remain unchanged! Acting under the assumption that it was real, he had plotted to possess it!

Hmm... Actually, there is something I would like to ask. Mr. Edgeworth. You had stated something earlier to the effect of the defendant had <span style="color:#E16935">spied on</span> Mr. Corrida's private life...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I believe this would mean that he would have known about the note as well...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Th-That's it!)</span> Yes, and so naturally... This means Mr. Engarde would have known that the note was a fake!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Uungh!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! See here, Mr. Wright!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...Um, yes Your Honor?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I was the one who thought of the spying thing! Jumping in and stealing my thunder like that is simply... I can't even describe it!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Ah, yes... Sorry...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I could've even bragged about embarrassing Mr. Edgeworth to my grandchild had you not... For that, I assign you a penalty, Mr. Wright!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Whaaaaa!? <span style="color:#0070C0">(If only I had kept my mouth shut...)</span>

<p>Judge:<br/>
So then, the defendant knew this suicide note was a fake. And if that's true, then the situation has suddenly changed in a very dramatic way.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Exactly, Your Honor! The prosecution's theory as to what Mr. Engarde's <span style="color:#E16935">motive for murder</span> was... It has suddenly disappeared into thin air!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
But Your Honor! It's not as if Mr. Engarde monitored Mr. Corrida 24 hours a day! Perhaps the victim wrote the note in a place Mr. Engarde didn't know of!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well, right back at you, Mr. Edgeworth! Why don't you show us some proof that the victim made the forgery at an unknown place!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Gnnngh!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! Order! ...Mr. Edgeworth. It looks like this time, it is you who has dug his own grave.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Unnnngh... As I figured...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Huh? ...As you figured...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
As I figured... It came down to this after all...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Edgeworth, you are not making any sense...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
When I heard the results of the handwriting analysis, I thought this might happen. The question is... "What next?"
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What next...??
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
If the prosecution can't prove Mr. Engarde's motive through the evidence, then we must prove it from another angle.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well, I agree with you there...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Your Honor. The prosecution... would like to call a witness to the stand at this time...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Oh. Well, that's fine.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
However... this witness... This witness is a little... unusual...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Edgeworth stuttering...? This is not like him at all.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Unusual? Well, what sort of witness is this person, Mr. Edgeworth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
This witness is one who is <span style="color:#E16935">perfectly fit</span> to answer once and for all the question of, "Who was it that hired Shelly de Killer to commit murder?"
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That's impossible!! Who in the...!? No such person exists who can answer that question with such certainty!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Y-Yes! Mr. Edgeworth! Who is this witness!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It is... It's... um...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes!? Go on! Who is it!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The man himself... Mr. Shelly de Killer.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Oh, Mr. de Killer. ... W-W-Waaaaait!! Shelly de Killer!? Um, you mean... The killer? Err... I mean the assassin?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Yes... Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
He's coming here? To the witness stand...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Well, yes, in a manner of speaking... I recognize that this is a very unusual circumstance, so I ask for your permission.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Y-Yes?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Is this alright with you?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Do I have a choice here...? I can't really do much else to drag this trial out...)</span> The defense has no objections, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I wonder if it really is alright to do this...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Very well then. The prosecution calls our witness to the stand!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Edgeworth... Is there no other way left to us...?)</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Now then, witness. ...Um, your name... and your, uh... occupation, please.
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">Very good, sir. My name is Shelly de Killer, and I am a professional assassin.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I... I say!! Wh-What is going on here!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Your Honor?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
How can you remain so calm? And what is the meaning of this two-way radio...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Actually, Your Honor, it was delivered to me just now... And it came with a condition. As long as we do not trace its source, Mr. de Killer will testify to this court.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So this must be what that urgent phone call he got earlier was about...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Oh no, this will not do. I cannot allow this in my court. First of all, we can't even be sure this is really Mr. de Killer himself!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Witness. Please present some sort of proof that you are in fact Shelly de Killer.
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">I understand. Please wait a second.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
...?
</p><p>???:<br/>
<span style="color:green">...</span>
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
<span style="color:green">... I'm... sooo... hungry...</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
M-M-Maya!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Maya!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
A... A voice! Mr. Wright! Can you confirm anything from this!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The defense has no objections to this person! We are satisfied that this man is indeed Shelly de Killer!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
It looks like we have run into yet another unexpected turn of events... Well, it doesn't seem like we have too many choices under these circumstances, so...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...Now then, witness. There is one thing I would like to confirm before we speak of anything else.
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">And what would that be?</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
At the request of a client, you killed Mr. Juan Corrida. Is this correct?
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">... It is as you say. I did indeed kill Mr. Corrida.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
*gulp*
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Now that we have answered that, let's move on to the name of your client!
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">...Very well.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
This is all just a bad dream... Yes, that's it, a bad dream...

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
This... This is outrageous! I was deceived! This witness is telling a very serious lie!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
B-But you were the one who summoned this witness!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Grk! Grr... Y-You... Shelly de Killer...!
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">My testimony is the truth. The defendant at the moment is Matt Engarde, am I correct? All I wish to do is help procure his <span style="color:#E16935">acquittal</span>.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
H... Hmm...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Wow... All of a sudden, it feels like we can actually win this.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The prosecution has failed to provide a motive and has instead, provided this suicide note, which is a forgery created by the victim. Furthermore, there is a possibility the defendant himself knew it was a fake. But most definitive of all, we have heard from the assassin himself; the name of his client. Mr. de Killer's client who requested the murder was not the defendant at all!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...No...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
With all this evidence, it is obvious to me that this means that Mr. Matt Engarde... Is <span style="color:#E16935">innocent</span>!
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">I seem to have caused you all a bit of confusion. Please, continue your discussion, and call me when you have reached a verdict.</span>
</p>
<center><span style="color:green">...*beep*...</span></center>
<p><br/>
Judge:<br/>
Bailiff! Please bring Ms. Adrian Andrews in immediately!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
What now? With the way this is going, Engarde will be found innocent. This may be our <span style="color:#E16935">last chance</span>... to save Maya...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah... But... But Edgeworth is right. De Killer is lying! And Engarde... my client... I know he's guilty! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Can I live with myself if I win this!?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Who would've believed that the prosecution's own witness would absolve the defendant!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Your Honor! The prosecution requests permission to further question the witness! Shelly de Killer is certainly lying under oath!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm...
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
It wasn't me! Listen! Everyone! Please! That testimony just now... It was all one big lie!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Ms. Andrews...
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
The suicide note may have been a fake. But! That man... Matt... He's the reason Celeste died! And Juan's death... It was all because he got pulled into Matt's twisted world! That testimony just now... You have to believe me... It was a horrible, horrible lie...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
But... Mr. de Killer himself has testified... He has named <span style="color:#E16935">you</span> as his client.
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
No! That's not true!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Also, there is quite a bit of evidence that points to you. <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [The knife and button, donning the Nickel Samurai's costume...] in the original release">The knife and button, donning the Nickel Samurai costume...</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [The knife and button, donning the Nickel Samurai's costume...] in the original release)</span>
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
But that's... That's...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You even have a motive. We know that Ms. Celeste Inpax was a large part of your life. You wanted to follow her... And you wanted revenge against the two who hurt her. I would say you have plenty of reasons to want them both dead.
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
I... No... Mr. Wright!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
You... You know the truth! Tell them! Tell them the real story... Who the real killer is... Tell them! Please... Help me...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes, I know the truth...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes, Your Honor?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I believe we have reached the end of this trial. Therefore, I ask the defense for any final words or opinions.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
... <span style="color:#0070C0">(I have to decide... Do I take the not guilty verdict and save Maya... Or do I throw this chance away and wait for Gumshoe's new evidence...? What am I supposed to do!?)</span>

I can't do it, Mia... I can't accept a not guilty.

You are a lawyer.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I know. But... But Matt Engarde is a killer -- a <span style="color:#E16935">murderer</span>! I can't... I can't let him get away with this. I can't let someone else take the fall. If I let Ms. Andrews be convicted, then I am no better than Engarde. And even though I don't want to admit it, I have to face the fact that it is because of Edgeworth that I now know the real truth. He could've gotten Engarde convicted so many times over, but he never took a single one of those chances. If I take this verdict right now... I'd be betraying his trust. <span style="color:#0070C0">(...His <span style="color:#E16935">trust</span>...? I never thought about it until now... I...

So why do you think your client did that?

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well, fiddling around at the scene of the crime is pretty risky. And why would someone who has requested a murder go to the crime scene anyway?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm, that is true.
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">I assume it was probably done to frame Mr. Engarde.</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
If that's the case, then why didn't the person just request that you do it...?
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">Sadly, that is not possible.</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh?
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">My job is to kill. That is all. And to leave my business card behind, naturally. The business card is so my clients may escape blame. To protect them is my duty.</span>

<p>Phoenix:<br/>
Thank you so much for taking the time to testify, Mr. de Killer.
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">What is the meaning of that attitude?</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
When Adrian Andrews entered the victim's room, your "client" had no idea that Juan Corrida had been murdered!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
But how... How do you know that!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
From this wine glass, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The glass...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Mr. de Killer's supposed client thought Mr. Corrida had only fainted. Which is why this glass of tomato juice was poured for the victim!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... But isn't that just a part of Adrian Andrews' calculated plan?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That is not possible, Your Honor. This glass bears the fingerprints of that person. Had this been planned, they would never have left their fingerprints behind!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I see your point... Mr. Edgeworth!? What is your opinion?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Strangely enough... I had the same exact thought just now. Witness! How do you explain this strange phenomenon!?
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">I-Isn't it a waste of time to ask about such a minor detail? It's not a very important point anyway, correct...?</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I'm afraid you are mistaken. If Adrian Andrews really is your client, as you claim... Then your client should have had knowledge of Mr. Corrida's death. If not... Then that can only mean that Adrian Andrews was never your client at all!
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">... How strange...</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes?
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">Why is it that the attorney has yet to raise an objection at this absurd situation...?</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Phoenix. If De Killer figures out what we're up to, we're in real trouble!

Yeah, I know...

Mr. Edgeworth! I'm surprised! You know you can't say things like that without any evidence.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Ah... Sorry.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
... Th-That sounded like an awfully weak "Objection!" to me...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Anyway! I am positive there was a contradiction in that testimony. The prosecution requests further testimony concerning when the request was taken!

<p>Phoenix:<br/>
I would like to go over this one more time. You met Adrian Andrews at a bar and took the request at that time?
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">Yes, that is correct.</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
And that's when you thought "he" was trustworthy...
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">How many times must I repeat myself? Yes, that is correct.</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I'm sorry, but that is an impossible tale.
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">Wh-What!?</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Shelly de Killer. You have never met the real Adrian Andrews!
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">...! Wh-Why would you say that...?</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Because you made one very big <span style="color:#E16935">slip-up</span>... ...about her.
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">So what is the issue... ...! Wh-What did you say just now...? About "<span style="color:#E16935">her</span>"...?</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
If you had ever met Adrian Andrews in person... One look would have told you that she is a <span style="color:#E16935">woman</span>!
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">Ohoooooo!</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
O-Order! Order in the court! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
This witness testified to the following: That he always meets face to face with his clients when taking their request.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
But he has never met Adrian Andrews in person...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Yes, Your Honor! That is exactly the point! That means Mr. de Killer's client could not have been Ms. Adrian Andrews!
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">Ugnnn...</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Edgeworth... I understand your logic on this one... However... Why would the assassin make such a basic mistake?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I believe it has to do with her <span style="color:#E16935">name</span>, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Her name?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Yes. Adrian Andrews is, without a doubt, a very androgynous name.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... Yes, I see...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Unluckily for Mr. de Killer, the entire time he was on the stand, no one had stated Adrian Andrews' gender. And so, he simply picked the wrong gender to go with.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Wh-What... What is going on...? Shelly de Killer! This court demands an explanation!
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">Umm... I-I think somehow... I must have mixed up this client with another.</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
So does that mean you remember something different now?
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">Yes, of course. Please, if you would allow me to testify once more...</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Argh! I know he's just going to spit out more lies.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well. But this time, please give us the truth, and nothing but the truth!

<p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">Yes, now I remember. I took that request by mail.<br/>
There have been times when I took a job without having met my client.<br/>
The request was for the murder of Juan Corrida and 2 or 3 other small things.<br/>
When I saw the name at the end of the letter, I thought my client to be a man.</span>

<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... So you took this job through a letter...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He didn't mention anything about a letter in his earlier testimony... Which means he is definitely lying!)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Be careful, Phoenix. If you break the assassin's testimony completely, it's over for us.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I know... I can't make him suspicious. But... I think we're OK -- like we can do this. <span style="color:#0070C0">(As long as he's standing there across from me... No matter how strong of a punch I throw, he'll counter it...)</span>

After the award ceremony, I went by myself to Matt's room. Matt was standing there in front of his room, still in his Nickel Samurai costume. Matt gave the bellboy a tip.

Your Honor. It is our duty to examine every piece of evidence, down to the last. I request that Ms. von Karma be allowed to present these pieces of evidence!

Hmm... I suppose you are right, Mr. Edgeworth. I grant permission to do so. However, this one obvious rule applies here; If these items do not bring up any new points, then they will not be accepted by this court.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Now, Ms. von Karma. If you please.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
These pieces of evidence are items left by De Killer during his escape from the police.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... He must have been in quite a rush.

Yes, Your Honor. De Killer left <span style="color:#E16935">three pieces of evidence</span>.

That's right. It looks like he was trying to recover it. He injured three of the officers at the site.

Wonderful... Absolutely splendid. This judge is such a brilliant man, isn't he?

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Is this the end...?)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Phoenix.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I knew it... There's no such thing as a "miracle" in this world, is there?

I think you're wrong. I think they do exist. But you have to make that "miracle" happen. You've come this far! You can't give up now!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But... But... No matter how you think about it... It's... It's...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Try... For my sake. Just think about it for a second. There are <span style="color:#E16935">two ways</span> out of this situation for us.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(T-Two!?)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
The first... Make Engarde wish from the bottom of his soul for a <span style="color:#E16935">guilty verdict</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
De Killer will always place his client's wishes first. If Engarde himself wished to be convicted, then he will let his hostage go.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Th-That may be true, but... That's asking me to do the impossible!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
The second way... Force De Killer to end his contract with Engarde. If De Killer were to no longer think of Engarde as his "client"... Then he would let Maya go.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Mia! That's even more impossible! He is a man who values his duty towards his clients above all else!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
... I know both of these seem like impossible feats at first. But if you could make either one happen, it would truly be a "miracle".
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The bigger problem is, the judge has already said he doesn't need any more evidence! The pieces he was just shown -- he's not accepting them!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Phoenix. Think things through from the <span style="color:#E16935">other side</span>. Isn't that what has always worked for us?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(The "other side"...? Wait, does she mean...)</span> You mean... to <span style="color:#E16935">turn things around</span>?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Phoenix. The judge says he doesn't need the evidence. If that's the case, then who does need it?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">("The person who needs the evidence"...)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
The defense, prosecution, and the judge... We have seen all the pieces of evidence. And that is how we have come to know the "<span style="color:#E16935">truth</span>". <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [But there are people who have not seen them all.] in the original release">But there is one person who has yet to seen them all.</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [But there are people who have not seen them all.] in the original release)</span> <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [And those people do not know the 'truth'.] in the original release">And that person does not know the "truth".</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [And those people do not know the 'truth'.] in the original release)</span> That truth...

<p>And just like that, the case came to an end. I ran away from the courtroom... and wandered the streets alone. I never saw Maya again. De Killer is a man of his word, so I'm sure he released her as promised. I heard the verdict of Ms. Andrews' trial a few days later. She was found guilty, of course. The "miracle" never happened. Maybe it was never meant to. Because a "miracle" is something that doesn't exist.

Oh, come now, Mr. Wright. Assassins aren't above blackmail.

Yes, that's where the video comes in. With that, I can keep him at bay, and even blackmail him if I want.

I have one question for the witness.
</p><p>de Killer:<br/>
<span style="color:green">Yes?</span>

<span style="color:green">Yes, that's right.</span>

<span style="color:green">... That's obvious. I would break our contract in that case. And then... That client would become my next target. For the honor of the De Killer name, even if it takes an eternity... I would follow that person to the ends of the earth to exact my punishment.</span>

I see. That's all I wanted to know.

She always has you in her sights. Now! I do believe it's time to finally hand down a verdict!

Mr. Engarde. It looks like somehow, you got what you wanted. You will finally receive the acquittal you wanted so badly. You should be happy.

But before that, I would like to make one final statement. Sometime in the near future, one very betrayed assassin may appear before you.
</p><p>Engarde:<br/>

Needless to say, that man is very good at what he does. I'm sure you would understand what I mean, if you watch this video.

Now then, Your Honor! The verdict, if you please.

I-Is this alright with you, Mr. Wright?

Don't worry. She may in time. After all, I was like that myself, until a year ago...

E-Edgeworth...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
For my own personal victories... and for guilty verdicts... I used every dirty trick in the book. And so my win record remained spotless. But... A man appeared and stood fast against that selfish me. I fought him in my usual manner, and tasted my first defeat. I felt like I had lost everything because of that. And then... It was my turn to sit in the defendant's chair. And I was saved... by that person I called my "enemy"... I couldn't forgive myself for all that had happened. So I left the Prosecutor's Office. And I left that note... "Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth chooses death"...
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Hmph, as well you should have. A prosecutor who has shamed himself with defeat should crawl into a hole and die!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...But that was not what happened. After I left the Prosecutor's Office, I finally came to realize something. And it was in that moment of clarity that everything began to change.

Wh-What!? You trusted your enemy!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It doesn't matter how many underhanded tricks a person uses... The truth will always find a way to make itself known. The only thing we can do is to fight with the knowledge we hold and everything we have. Erasing the paradoxes one by one... It's never easy... We claw and scratch for every inch.

</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
The "truth"...

Yes. That's the reason why prosecutors and defense lawyers exist. But I'm sure you knew that already, didn't you, Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

I don't want to hear the wretched whimpering of a disgraced loser! A Von Karma is someone who is destined to be perfect! Miles Edgeworth... You are no longer worthy! You are no longer worthy of being a Von Karma! And neither am I! It's over... It's all over!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Franziska threw something on the ground just now...)</span>

This is... an <span style="color:#E16935">electromagnetic receiver</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Isn't that the thing she used to track Detective Gumshoe...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I'll return this to the precinct later. There's something else...
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Ah! Isn't that Ms. von Karma's whip!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
"I'll never set foot in another courtroom again"... I'm sure that's what she's saying by this action...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
You should keep this, Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
... Umm... OK.
</p><p>???:<br/>
Nick!!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
......! M-M-M... MAYA!
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Mystic Maya! Mystic Mayaaaaaaaa!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Oh, Nick! I knew you would come through! You got Engarde convicted, like I knew you would... And on top of that, you even rescued me!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well, of course I did! You know I would never desert you! But we sure pressed our luck this trial... You're really lucky to be standing here!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Whatever, whatever. Look, it's over, OK? Besides, if I did croak, I would just come back and haunt you like a bad ghost through Pearly!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

</p><p>Maya:<br/>
... Th-Thanks a lot... Nick.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Um... Don't mention it.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Maya...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Oh, Mr. Edgeworth.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Um... I'm relieved you're alright.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Hey... It looks like you've made some real progress, Mr. Edgeworth!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Umm... Well, I suppose I'm a little different from who I was a year ago.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Heh...
</p><p>*growwwwl...grrrrr...urrrr...*
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Alright! I think it's time we got out of this depressing place!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh? Where are we going!?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Food, Nick! FOOD! Grub! Chow! I'm starved! I'm so hungry even you look like a nice, juicy burger on a bun to me, Nick!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Y-You think I look like a burger...? I'm a Prime Rib at least!
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Come with us, Mr. Edgeworth! Please!!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Uh, um... If you insist...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Alright... So how about we hit up our usual burger joint...?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Don't be silly, Nick.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
This case messed up that awesome evening, and got in the way of my gourmet food. So I've decided that we have to make it up by having another feast!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
A-Another feast...?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
C'mon, Nick! FOOOOOOD!

Hey, pal! Sorry to keep you guys waiting!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Gumshoe! Are you alright!?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yeah, but I'm really embarrassed. I didn't think I would hit a telephone pole, of all things.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
A telephone pole...? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Then, it wasn't a red light that got him...?)</span>

Now lookie here, mister snooty prosecutor! Don't ya reckon ya bullied Mr. Wright too hard!? If ya don't start bein' a lot nicer to him, he might just kick it... Tonight, even!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Umm... I'll keep that in mind.
</p><p>Lotta:<br/>
Well, come on now! Everyone gather 'round! Y'all are gonna get yer picture taken by a genuine professional photographer!

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Looks like Lotta bought herself a new camera...)</span>
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Well, pal... At least we can put this messy case behind us now. Come on! Tonight's all about eating, so let's go chow down, pal!

Amen to that, pal! Amen!

You know, when you think about it, you were the one who saved the day, Detective!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Huh? Me? ...You really think so?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
He's right. If it wasn't for the three items you took... I think this trial would have had a very different ending.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Ah, well, you know... It's... Ho ho. Ho ho ho ho. Ho ho ho ho ho. ...Huh? Wait. That's odd...

</p><p>Lotta:<br/>
Aw, come on y'all. It's over! But whoo boy, I tell ya! You really are somethin' else! Between getting' accused of murder and getting' kidnapped... Never a dull moment with you, huh?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Hahaha, you think?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why does she look so happy about that...?)</span>
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
But being shut away for two whole days... Weren't you scared...?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Yeah, it was really scary. I felt so hopeless. So to keep my mind off of things, I drew a picture!
</p><p>Lotta:<br/>
Sounds like ya had it rough, gal! So where's this picture of yers?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Yeah! I want to see it! I want to see Mystic Maya's picture!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
... Hmm... You know, I don't know where it went...
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Aww... That's too bad...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
W-Well, it's alright! It wasn't anything important anyway.

What is it, Edgeworth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
This thing is picking something up.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Ah! That's! That's Ms. von Karma's receiver! Ugh. Thanks to her, I had the most awful experience of my life, sir! I can't believe she stuck a tracking device on me...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
That's odd. Even though you're standing right here... The tracking device seems to be in a different location.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Oh... It's probably busted or something, sir.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
... ...Well, it doesn't matter. I'm afraid it's about time for me to excuse myself. I still have some work to do.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Huh!? But Mr. Edgeworth! You haven't even eaten anything yet!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(And you've eaten way too much, you glutton!)</span>

I had fun tonight. Now, if you'll excuse me...

Wait.

What?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
... I just want to say... Thanks, Edgeworth. You really saved me out there.

Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?

Uh... I'm not sure I follow you.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection denied.

How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?

They aren't, are they...

Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.

That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Matt Engarde...

Judge:<br/>
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!
