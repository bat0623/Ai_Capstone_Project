<div style="text-align: right;">Episode 4<br/>Farewell, My Turnabout</div>
<p><br/>
Now! The moment you've all been waiting for! Who will be this year's Grand Prix Champion? Who will be our "Hero of Heroes"!? Will it be last year's runner-up, Jammin' Ninja!? Or maybe Captain Saipan all the way from the lovely tropical island of Saipan!? I see the students of a certain Starry School are raring to win! And Global Hero Onyankopon doesn't want to go home without the prize! We hope Lady Luck is with all our heroes tonight! And now! The winner of the third annual Hero of Heroes Grand Prix... IS ME!!
</p><p>Whoooooooooa! The true hero of the night has appeared in our midst! It looks like this year's Grand Prix goes to this fantastic warrior! The Nickel Samurai! Too bad, Jammin' Ninja. Looks like the title eluded you again this year!
</p>

<p><br/>
Maya:<br/>
Alright! Yes! Did you hear that, Nick!? Did you!? The Nickel Samurai! He did it!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah, he sure did... *sigh* I'm getting too old for this.
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
Ah, I'm proud of the guy for doing the series justice.
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
U-Um... So the person everyone was cheering for... I guess he got the prize?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Yup! You know who we're talking about, right Pearly? "The Nickel Samurai"!
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
No. Every Sunday, I only watch the Educational Channel's "Kids' Masterpiece Theatre".
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
OK, that's it! From now on, it's "The Nickel Samurai"! All the kids watch it!
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Do you like "The Nickel Samurai" too, Mr. Nick?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Nah, Nick's an old fart, so he's not allowed to watch it anymore.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That's right. But I do like "Kids' Masterpiece Theatre".
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Hey, I didn't know you were so young at heart, Nick!
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Mr. Nick! You're a grown-up! You're not allowed to watch it anymore! You're supposed to act your age and have interests that match. ...It's very important.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Aw, give it a rest, Pearly!
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
Looks like I made the right choice in inviting everyone here. I'm glad you're all having a good time.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Aaaaah... It's like a dream!
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
Too bad for the Jammin' Ninja, though. Last year, he lost to The Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo. I thought this might be his year...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Yeah... Oh, hey, did anyone else think that the Jammin' Ninja was a bit different today?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Different? What do you mean?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Um, well, he wasn't carrying his bright red guitar.
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
Hey, you're right! Strange he'd walk around without his signature guitar.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...*sigh* I will never understand these people and their shows...)</span> Anyway, Mr. Powers, thank you very much for tonight.
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
A-Aw, it was nothing... I owe you one, so it's just my way of saying thanks.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Hey, Nick! Come on! It's time to get going to the lobby! There's a post-ceremony stage show that's supposed to start real soon.
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
And then, I heard there's going to be a press conference after that.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
A press conference? Is he going to make a speech about winning this year's prize?
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
Uh, well, not exactly... Something about the Nickel Samurai <span style="color:#E16935">confessing</span> something.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Confessing...? Sounds pretty serious.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Argh! Nick! COME ON! You don't want us to be the last ones there, do you!?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Yeah, Mr. Nick! Do you!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why me...? The show doesn't even start for another 20 minutes...)</span>

The Steel Samurai. An epic story of one hero in a desperate fight against his arch-enemy, the Evil Magistrate in the city of Neo Olde Tokyo. And last year, they started a new series, "The Nickel Samurai". The new series seems to be a hit with the kids, too.

There was a small footbridge with a sign next to it that said, "Beware, Bridge Out!" And along comes a snot-nosed little punk kid right up to the bridge. I tried to tell the boy the bridge was out and it was dangerous, but would he listen!? No, of course not! He said he'd be careful and only walk on the "in" part of the bridge since the "out" part is what was dangerous! I am not kidding you here! The kid said that and really meant it! WELL!

Ms. Oldbag, what are you doing here? What happened to your position at Global Studios...?
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
Oh, that old place? Well, since "that" incident, they've been letting people go. When they cut the security team, I got the pink slip.

Um, I guess you must have done something... um... "deh-plor-ible"...

Y-Yeah...
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
And you! Weren't you the one who was bullying me -- this fragile girl at heart!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Um... I plead the fifth.
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
But you know, I think maybe I rubbed the upper management the wrong way by testifying. ... Yes, that has to be it! Everything is all your fault!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
M-Me!?
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
I thought about being a bodyguard at first, after being handed ol' pinky.

I already gave you my name earlier, but I'll add that I'm Mr. Engarde's manager.

His manager... Speaking of managers, did the victim, Mr. Corrida have one?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
No, he did not.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
He didn't?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Global Studios has a very different policy from Worldwide Studios in that Worldwide Studios does not assign individual managers to their stars.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I see...
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
This industry is very ruthless and unforgiving. Actually, you look quite ruthless and unforgiving yourself to your poor partner. Dragging a little girl like her to places like this. Honestly.

So what's the "Jammin' Ninja" TV show like?
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
It started from a remake of an old movie, to tell you the truth. The Jammin' Ninja is, like the Samurai shows, aimed towards kids. It's the story of a ninja who can't climb a wall, but became a big pop star.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...Uh, what?
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
He was a really lousy ninja. Absolutely couldn't do any ninja things right at all. But boy could he sing! With his trusty bright red guitar in hand, he took the ancient world by storm.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
A... A ninja... With a bright red guitar...!?
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
And then, the final fight in front of his beloved Princess Misola! "Jammin' versus the Muromachi Five!" Suddenly! Our brave hero catches a not so Jammin' cold the night before Battle 3!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Aww, that's too bad for him...
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
Y-Yeah... But this kind of pop music-based love story is something high school girls really like.
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Um...
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
Yes, Pearl?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Wh-What happens next!? I want to know!
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Jammin'... The Jammin' Ninja! Will he be able to sing!? What about Princess Misola!?
</p><p>Powers:<br/>
Every Sunday at 8 AM.
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Umm... Which show should I watch...? Hmm...

When Celeste Inpax suddenly committed suicide, the world before her turned pitch dark... That's according to Adrian Andrews herself.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Then... That means her super-confident attitude...
