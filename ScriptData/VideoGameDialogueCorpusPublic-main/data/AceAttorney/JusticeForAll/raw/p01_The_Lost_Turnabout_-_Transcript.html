<p>Phoenix:<br/> 
...*huff*...*huff*... Grr!! How did I get into this mess...?
</p>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">That's far enough! You can't run forever, Mr. Phoenix Wright!</span></center>
<p><br/>
Phoenix:<br/>
Wha...!? What have I done wrong!?
</p>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">I cannot allow you to go on like this!</span></center>
<p><br/>
Phoenix:<br/>
...? B-But I'm just a simple defense attorney!

<p><br/>
Phoenix:<br/>
What a nightmare... And I bet it was this ringtone that caused it... I really shouldn't be dozing off right before a trial starts anyway...
</p><p>Phone:<br/>
<span style="color:green">...*beep*...</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/> 
Huh... looks like they hung up.
</p><p>???:<br/>
Ah, good. I finally found it. Talk about a close call. I hate to do this to you, but... It's nothing personal... Mr. Attorney.
</p>

<p><br/>
Phoenix:<br/>
... Ouch... My head... It's throbbing... And why does it feel... so foggy in there...?
</p><p>???:<br/> 
Gooood morning!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/> 
Ack! Uh... G-Good morning...
</p><p>???:<br/> 
What's wrong!? You don't look well! People are at their best first thing in the morning! Where's that fighting spirit!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/> 
... Sorry, but can you please turn the cheeriness down? My head... sort of hurts...
</p><p>???:<br/> 
Roger that!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/> 
...
</p><p>???:<br/> 
...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/> 
... Um... Am I in trouble or something?
</p><p>???:<br/> 
Huh? "Trouble...?"
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/> 
W-Wait, never mind. You're a policewoman, right? I thought maybe I had done something wrong...?
</p><p>???:<br/> 
Wh-What are you talking about? I'm the one in trouble!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/> 
... What?
</p><p>Byrde:<br/> 
I'm placing my life in your hands today, Mr. Phoenix Wright!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/> 
Life... in... my hands...?
</p><p>Byrde:<br/> 
You promised me! You said you would prove that I was <span style="color:#E16935">not guilty</span>!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/> 
"N... Not... guilty"?
</p><p>Byrde:<br/> 
Just when I thought all hope was lost; when all the other lawyers had laughed me off... "Leave it to me!" you said! You! The one and only Phoenix Wright came to save the day! And just like that, I was moved to tears, sir! I'll never forget what you're doing for me, EVER!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What is this girl babbling about...?)</span>
</p><p>Byrde:<br/> 
Actually, I really love to watch court proceedings, and I always root for you to win! When I'm off duty, I like to come here and... ...? What's wrong? You've been acting really strange and you keep staring at me. You're making me kind of nervous, sir...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/> 
Oh... sorry. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Hmm... I'm afraid to ask, but here goes...)</span> So, this might sound bad, but... uh... Who are you...?
</p><p>Byrde:<br/> 
Whaaaaat!? Mr. Wright!! How can you say that!? How can you do this to the fragile heart of a girl about to go on trial...? You're absolutely horrible!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/> 
No -- I mean, I didn't mean it like that! 
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
Is this how a defense attorney treats his clients, sir!? I can't believe this!!  
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
No, it's just... ...Well, I think you have the wrong person. I'm... 
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
Yes...!? "I'm..."!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/> 
... ... I'm... Who am I? <span style="color:#0070C0">(Why am I drawing a blank...?)</span>
</p><p>Bailiff:<br/>
The trial will begin shortly. Will the defendant and her lawyer please proceed to the courtroom immediately!
</p><p>Byrde:<br/> 
The trial's about to start! I'm counting on you in there, OK?
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hmm... I guess I must have <span style="color:#E16935">amnesia</span>... Let's see... What can I piece together...? Hmm, from our conversation, I can safely say that I'm probably a <span style="color:#E16935">defense attorney</span>. And that girl... I said I'd prove her "<span style="color:#E16935">not guilty</span>"... I can't believe I made such an irresponsible promise.)</span> Aaaaaargh! Someone, please!! Tell me this is just a bad dream!

The court will not hear the defense's excuses. Because the defendant is a member of the police, this case is under great scrutiny. Therefore, we must make this trial fair but swift. I believe I have told you this before. I hope you're not telling me you've forgotten!

</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Payne, your opening statement, please.
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Yes, Your Honor. As I'm sure you're well aware, the defendant is accused of killing her <span style="color:#E16935">lover</span>. What's worse, her lover was a fellow <span style="color:#E16935">police officer</span>!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
A policeman? You did WHAT to a policeman!?
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
It wasn't me! And besides, Dustin and I... We weren't "lovers" like that!
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
In any case... The prosecution will prove that the guilty party is none other than the defendant!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well. Mr. Payne, please call your first witness.
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Hee, hee, hee. It's been a while, Mr. Wright. Let's see what you've learned since last time. I won't show you any mercy this time, rookie!

<p>Payne:<br/>
Witness, please state your name and occupation.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
My name is Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You don't look very well, Detective.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Well, sir, the defendant... She works under me, so, you know...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You work under that detective?
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
Yes, sir! And while I was a trainee, he was always watching out for me, sir! He's such a wonderful guy, sir! I'll never forget what he's done for me!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(OK, calm down, I believe you.)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Detective Gumshoe. Please describe for us the details of this murder.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yes, sir. It happened at the park near headquarters, "<span style="color:#E16935">Exposé Park</span>". The victim was one of the local cops, Dustin Prince. He was pushed down from the benches on the upper path, sir. The landing beat his body up bad and snapped his neck.
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
The details are listed in the report that was distributed yesterday...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Ah, yes. This <span style="color:#E16935">autopsy report</span>, correct?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why do I not remember getting a copy...?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I see everything is in order here. Even the estimated time of death is unusually well documented!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
The victim's watch stopped from the impact of the landing, sir. The results of the autopsy confirmed the time of death.
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
If I may, Your Honor, the prosecution would like to submit this photograph.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well. The court accepts it into evidence.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Crime Photo 1 added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Now then, I recall at yesterday's preliminary hearing, a very important piece of <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span> was brought to our attention.
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Yes, Your Honor.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yes, sir.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes... I guess?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Wright! Is your head on right today!? There was a very crucial piece of evidence found under the victim's body!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Um, was there?
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
Have you lost your mind!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well, actually... Um, it's just nerves. Give me a second.
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
Whaaaat!? How can you talk like such an amateur!? I thought you were a pro, sir! ... Alright, sir. I'll help you through this! At a time like this, maybe you ought to take a glance at the <span style="color:#E16935">Court Record</span>!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...Court Record?
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
Yup! Info about <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span> and <span style="color:#E16935">people</span> involved with this case are all listed there, sir! <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [You can look at the Court Record by touching the Court Record Button!] in the original release">You can look a the Court Record by pressing [the <span style="color:#E16935">R Button</span> / Tab]!</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [You can look at the Court Record by touching the Court Record Button!] in the original release)</span>

This is a court of law! You can't just make wild guesses!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Agreed.
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
They're right, Mr. Wright! You have to check the <span style="color:#E16935">Court Record</span> before you answer! If you don't, your client might end up with a guilty verdict!

The victim grabbed the criminal's glasses as he was being shoved, sir, and held onto them as he fell.

Nnnngh... Yes, this is my spare pair. But these glasses they found at the scene of the crime are not mine! I swear, sir!

<p>Gumshoe:<br/>
There's something even more incriminating than the glasses under the victim's body, sir.<br/>
During his date, the victim was pushed from the bench area.<br/>
But he managed to write the culprit's name on the ground where he landed.<br/>
I don't like saying it, but it was clearly the defendant's name, "Maggie", sir.<br/>
With this piece of evidence and the glasses, it's hard to say she's not the culprit.

I guess there's no way around it! OK, I'm going to lend you a hand! The prosecution's witnesses all hide things from the court, which means they <span style="color:#E16935">lie</span> from time to time.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Lie? But... isn't that detective your superior?
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
Well, even if they don't mean to lie, sometimes people just <span style="color:#E16935">remember things wrong</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Hmm, like that detective. He does sort of look like a scatterbrain...
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
It doesn't matter! Either way, it's bad for us, sir! That's why when you question witnesses, you have to find and <span style="color:#E16935">expose their lies</span>!

We found out that there was sand trapped under the victim's fingernail.<br/>
There were also scratches on the skin that were caused by him writing on the ground.<br/>
From this, we could confirm that the victim wrote this name with his right hand.

Hey, don't you look down on us! I told you! We're not a bunch of simpletons, pal! Everyone knows you can't find out everything you want with scientific investigation!

I've never heard that before.

Me, either.

<p>Phoenix:<br/>
Detective Gumshoe. Take a look at this.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
That's the glove, right?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Could you tell the court what is special about this glove?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
What's special? Um, never really thought about it, but uh... It's REALLY yellow... ... And that's about it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes, it's REALLY yellow, but that is only one of its qualities.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Huh?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
There's another reason why it's special.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
And what would that be?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It's very simple. This glove is made for a <span style="color:#E16935">left-handed</span> person!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Left-handed...?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Why, you're absolutely right! This glove is made to be worn on the <span style="color:#E16935">right hand</span>!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That is why it had to be custom-made. I have never seen a bright yellow left-hander's glove for sale. Have you?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Well, um... no.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So, Detective. Which hand did the victim use to write the name with, again...?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
That's easy! Look, it's obvious from this picture that it was his... W-W-Wait a sec...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Don't forget that the victim was <span style="color:#E16935">left-handed</span>!

This is... This is... I mean... I... Objec--
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Overruled. Mr. Wright, I would like to know what your line of reasoning proves.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
There is only one conclusion that can be drawn! A left-handed person could not have written a message with his right hand! Therefore! The person who wrote the name "<span style="color:#E16935">Maggie</span>" could not have been the victim!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! When you think about it that way, then yes, it is not possible that this name was written by the victim himself.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Then that means Maggey is...!
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
No... IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Payne.
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Y-Y-Yes, Your Honor?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The evidence the prosecution has presented has failed to prove the defendant's guilt. In fact, I believe you have proven her to be <span style="color:#E16935">innocent</span>!
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
NOOOOOOO!
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
Alright! You did it, Mr. Wright! Whew! I feel like I can breathe again!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
It seems that we have reached the conclusion. You did a fine job once again, Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Me, Your Honor? Ah, well, thank you, sir...
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
See, you got complimented by the judge again! You're really good! And that's why you can't give up being a lawyer, sir!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

But I will not stand for that! Now you've tinted the court's eyes and colored me wrongly. Sure, I suppose calling me a university student would not be the absolute truth, but to give in and <span style="color:#E16935">just settle would be as evil as death</span> and I can't have that! Everything in my life is to be of the utmost, highest, <span style="color:#E16935">top grade quality</span>, you understand. I am merely looking for that perfect, top notch, <span style="color:#E16935">unbeatable university</span>, don't you see...? I have a rigorous selection process and I was in serious thought during my "<span style="color:#E16935">walk</span>" as...
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Yes, yes, I understand. I'm very sorry. I will be more careful from now on.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Wh-What is he? A human chatterbox?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Ugh... I have to question HIM?
</p><p>???:<br/>
Fashion! Cars! Women! Glasses! And of course, University! First-rates only need apply!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Glasses...? But you aren't wearing glasses...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
That's enough! Your name, witness.
</p><p>???:<br/>
Oh? Is that how you want to play this? Using your power and influence to keep the young people down. I see how you work now. You old people and your dirty tricks. You thought you had me, but you thought wrong.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I-I'm sorry. It won't happen again.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Oh man...)</span>
</p><p>Wellington:<br/>
I forgive you. Alright, I suppose I can tell you my name. I am Richard Wellington, the "Drifting Virtuoso" with a Ph.D. in Drifting, as it were. If you wanted to, you could call me a "University Student in Transit".
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Ahem, Mr. Wellington. On the day of the murder, you were taking a... er, strolling through the park, correct?
</p><p>Wellington:<br/>
It would appear that you are attached to that word. If you must, then by all means. But I remind you that I am in no way a prepubescent boy, "out on a walk" with mommy. If you must know, I am--
</p><p>Payne:<br/>
Anyway! Please testify to this court what you saw during your walk through the park!
</p><p>Wellington:<br/>
See, you said it again! "<span style="color:#E16935">Taking a walk</span>"... You know, you--
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What you witnessed will do, Mr. Wellington!

<p>Wellington:<br/>
I was at the park all afternoon, deep in thought about my life situation.<br/>
I don't remember the time all that well, but I do believe it was past 6 PM.<br/>
All of a sudden, a police officer falls from above, right in front of my eyes.<br/>
Without a thought, I looked up, and there I met the eyes of a charming, young lady.<br/>
Of course I remember her sweet face. It was that of the pretty defendant there.<br/>
The only other thing I saw was the banana that fell with the police officer.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm, that was certainly a decisive testimony.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Decisive!? Nick, did you hear what he just said!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
That's all you have to say? How can you be so calm!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It's strange... My mind is very calm and clear.)</span> Maybe it's because I... believe in <span style="color:#E16935">my client</span>.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
You mean Maggey?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes. And if she really is innocent, then that can only mean one thing: That guy is lying!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You may now question the witness, Mr. Wright.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
N-No name? Trashy...? 
</p><p>Wellington:<br/>
Now, this might be hard for a mush-headed, feeble-minded baboon like you, but I have to think very carefully about the future of our great country.

Tsk, tsk. I can't believe I have to deal with a worm like you. You're just a shallow man who can only slam on desks and point at people for fun. Hmph, I guess I don't have a choice. I'll try to explain it so that even a third-rate simpleton like you can understand. There was this little thing they call a "<span style="color:#E16935">clock</span>" at the park. Did you get that?

I looked at that clock, and that's how I knew the time. But if you ask me, this whole concept of breaking time apart into fragments...

Your Honor, it is very simple to mistake a glove for a bunch of bananas...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
No, I don't think so. Objection overruled.
</p><p>Wellington:<br/>
Y-Y-You... You're one of those people. Yes, you know what I mean. You're like those people who refused to accept <span style="color:#E16935">Galileo</span> for his Copernican Theory! You're too used to your world view to realize that there are other, new <span style="color:#E16935">possibilities</span>! Sure, <span style="color:#E16935">in the end</span>, we find out that it is in fact, a glove, not bananas. However... when <span style="color:#E16935">viewed from afar</span>, I do think there is room enough for doubt, don't you...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
And that is why I asked you how bad your eyesight is!
</p><p>Wellington:<br/>
They're both 20/200. I suppose you're going to tell me that's terrible, right!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Why are you not wearing your glasses today then?
</p><p>Wellington:<br/>
... Ummm... That's because I lost them recently, you see... Of course, I was planning on getting a new pair made right away! But you know, my glasses are no ordinary glasses, so to replace them--
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
How about when you witnessed the crime? Were you wearing your glasses then?
</p><p>Wellington:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
How about it, witness!?
</p><p>Wellington:<br/>
Y-You are an unrelenting, evil man. You're like those people who rejected <span style="color:#E16935">Joan of Arc</span> and put her to death! She was brave and <span style="color:#E16935">courageous</span>, only to be caught by horrible, unrighteous people. And while she didn't do anything wrong, she was still gruesomely <span style="color:#E16935">burned</span> at the--
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Which boils down to you were not wearing your glasses at that time! Therefore! The identity of the "woman" at the scene of the crime and that of the defendant cannot be proven to be the same by this witness!

But the height difference was only 9 feet! It was very possible for him to see the face of the culprit standing on the upper path!

Hmm... Witness. Please be more accurate in your testimony. Remember, a person's life is at stake.

Y-Yes, Your Honor!

<p>Wellington:<br/>
The girl on the upper path ran away as soon as she realized I was there.<br/>
After that, I immediately called the police station to report the crime.<br/>
It must've been 6:45 PM when I made the call.<br/>
They must have a lot of free time on their hands since they showed up within 10 minutes.

<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... So the person who was on the upper path saw you and then ran away.

Yes, that is correct. Which is why, even someone without a superior brain like mine can understand that... that girl is the murderer!

I believe the court all heard what you just confessed to: That these glasses are in fact yours! I'll tell you where they were found, Mr. Wellington. These glasses were found <span style="color:#E16935">under the victim's body</span>.

Your Honor! I think the answer is quite clear here! As he fell, Dustin Prince grabbed the culprit's glasses. The culprit knew that he had to find his glasses, and searched frantically for them.

Mr. Wellington. You didn't have your cell phone with you on the day of the murder, correct?
</p><p>Wellington:<br/>
So what if I didn't?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
When you realized you had lost it, what did you do?
</p><p>Wellington:<br/>
What did I do?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Didn't you try to find it by calling it?

Why you...! How did you...!?

Your Honor! These questions have nothing to do with...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Overruled. Mr. Wright, where are you going with this line of questioning? Do you think there is some relation between this witness' cell phone and the murder?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I do, Your Honor. On the day of the murder, Maggey Byrde picked up a lost phone in the park. And! She also received a phone call from the owner of the phone!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phone:<br/>
<span style="color:green">............... ...*beep*...</span>
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
"Um, hello?"
</p><p>???:<br/>
<span style="color:green">"Oh, thank you! I've been searching for my phone."</span>
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
"Is this yours? Oh, I'm glad you called! We can meet up and I can give this back!"
</p><p>???:<br/>
<span style="color:green">"I'll be right there, um... I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name..."</span>
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
"You can call me <span style="color:#E16935">Maggey</span>!"
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
That was when you learned that her name was "<span style="color:#E16935">Maggey</span>"!
</p><p>Wellington:<br/>
Uh, um, nnngh...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But you made one fatal mistake.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Fatal mistake?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
My client's name is "<span style="color:#E16935">Maggey</span>" but the name that was written on the ground was "<span style="color:#E16935">Maggie</span>". This is a mistake that could only occur if all you knew was how her <span style="color:#E16935">name sounded</span>!

The evidence... Evidence!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Uuugh! That guy is really creeping me out--
</p><p>Wellington:<br/>
All you've been waving around and talking about is that "suspicious" cell phone. Suspicious phone number this, suspicious con group that! They're all on that phone! But who's to say that phone is really mine!? Where's your proof!? Your evidence!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You want proof that this phone is yours?
</p><p>Wellington:<br/>
Ahahahaha! Ahehehehehe! I already told you earlier! That phone I lost -- I've already found it!

</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... We do seem to have a problem on our hands with this phone. Whose phone is it? Without knowing that, it's meaningless as evidence.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Your Honor! <span style="color:#0070C0">(This is bad... I can't let him turn the tables on me like this!! Hmm... This cell phone... There has to be something I've overlooked. There's got to be! Hmm... Maybe...)</span>

Mr. Wright. If you cannot prove who the owner of that cell phone is, your indictment has no basis, and therefore, no power. It looks like you came up a penny short.

Byrde:<br/>
I knew that the real you would shine through eventually! I am so moved by what you've done for me, sir! Thank you so much, Mr. Wright!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
I feel really bad for Dustin. He didn't do anything to deserve this...
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
... It's probably because of me...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh?
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
My whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Your whole life? It couldn't have been that bad, could it?
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
Since I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building, I've been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods, failed at almost every test I've ever taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster, and never won or even tied at a game of tic-tac-toe! My life has really been nothing but a <span style="color:#E16935">string of disasters</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That is, uh... pretty bad...
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
Up until I went to college, I was known as the "Goddess of Misfortune". And then, at the academy, everyone called me "Lady Luckless".
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
"Lady Luckless"...
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
What's worse is that my misfortune always seems to latch onto those around me.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
What do you mean?
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
When I see someone in trouble, I always try to help...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Ah, that's right. You were talking about this earlier.
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
It happened again recently, too, sir. There was an old lady pacing back and forth by the pedestrian crosswalk. I gave her my hand and... before I knew it, we were having dinner at my house.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
... Oh.
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
I'm sure that Dustin's gone because of me...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
That's not true!
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
That glove didn't even have any sort of special meaning. It was just a present to say thanks for covering one of my night shifts.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Oh, I see...
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
Everything is all my fault! Dustin's death, your head being all messed up...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Uh, well, I don't think my head is that messed up yet...
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
I'm going to find a new life for myself starting now. The next time we meet, I'm sure I'll... I'm sure I'll have found a whole ocean's worth of good luck by then, sir!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah. After all, the "<span style="color:#E16935">Goddess of Misfortune</span>" is only a name!
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
You bet! I'm gonna make it! I promise! Next time we meet, I'll only be an "<span style="color:#E16935">Unlucky Person</span>", instead of a goddess!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Y-Yeah! That's the spirit!
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
Well, Mr. Wright, Maya, I should get going.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
OK! Good luck to you!
</p><p>Byrde:<br/>
Thanks! You take care of yourselves, too!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
*sigh* What a horrible day... I've gotten my memory back, but things are still a little fuzzy...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
But you're OK, and that's what counts. You really had me worried! Come on, let's go back to the office.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hmm... I'm afraid to ask, but here goes...)</span> So, this might sound bad, but... uh... Who are you...?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
What!? I thought you said you got your memory back!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(At that moment, everything really did come back to me...)</span>
</p><p>Detective Gumshoe... He's someone I've had clashes with in the past during certain cases. But he's also been a good ally during others. The Judge... He's a lovable, kind old man who is easily swayed by other people's opinions. But in the end, he always comes up with the right verdict. ... This person... I haven't got a clue... He seems to know me, but maybe he's mistaking me for someone else...?
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(And this girl...)</span> ...Maya...?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
You... You finally remembered!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This is Maya Fey, my assistant. That's right... I have so many unforgettable memories about her. For example...)</span>
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Earth to Nick! What's wrong? You keep staring at me! Don't tell me you've missed me?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Uh, well, yeah I suppose I have. I feel like I haven't seen you in ages.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Oh? Well, I'm back now. So it's time for us to create new memories together!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Alright. Sounds good. <span style="color:#0070C0">(All the phone numbers on my phone were erased by Mr. Wellington. I guess I have to start over from the very beginning...)</span>
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Come on, Nick! Let's go to our usual burger joint!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
OK, OK. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Actually, it hasn't even been two months since she came back into my life.)</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p><span style="color:#0070C0">(And that story... That story began on one rainy afternoon, two months ago...)</span>

Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.

That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Maggey Byrde...

The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!
