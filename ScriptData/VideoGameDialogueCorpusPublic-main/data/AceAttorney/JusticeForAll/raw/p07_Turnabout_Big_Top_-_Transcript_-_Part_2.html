That's understandable.

You know... You've got to make a good first impression! When I enter the room, maybe I should fly in and warm up the crowd a little...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
No no no no no... We can't be having you flying around the courtroom... It just wouldn't be right. Imagine if you hit someone!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Don't worry Max... Just do what Nick says and everything will be OK.

Your Honor! Get on with it!

Oh... Sorry... I just realized that the defendant's name is Billy Bob Johns.

So...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well, isn't the defendant also known as Maximillion Galactica?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes, Your Honor, he does often go by that name.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You know, my grandchild is a huge fan of his. I think everyone here wouldn't mind if we call the defendant Maximillion Galactica... It sounds more... Friendly.

You have no chance. Zero. Zilch. Nada. I'm not losing this case! Why, you ask? Because it is not in the nature of a Von Karma to lose at anything!!

I guess being born with the name Von Karma is a free pass to be arrogant and annoying.

The night of the crime, snow was falling until 9:40 PM, making it extremely cold out.<br/>
All of the circus performers gathered in the Big Top to practice their routines.<br/>
The practice session broke up around <span style="color:#E16935">10 PM</span>.<br/>
The murder itself took place in the plaza in front of the lodging house at <span style="color:#E16935">10:15 PM</span>.<br/>
The victim was found bent over a <span style="color:#E16935">wooden box</span> dead as a doornail.<br/>
The cause of death was blunt force trauma that <span style="color:#E16935">snapped a vertebrae in his neck</span>.
</p>

<p>Judge:<br/>
I see... He was beaten to death.

A "wooden box"?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
That's right. The victim must have been carrying the wooden box when he was killed.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Carrying the box, huh?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
It was a rather strange wooden box, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What do you mean?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Well... It was much heavier than it looked... Not to mention it was locked.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Locked, you say?

This wooden box... You figure it weighs about 20 pounds, right?

Sounds about right. The whole thing is lined with iron.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Iron plating? Why do you think it's lined with iron?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
I figure they just did it to make the box heavier... Yeowch!!

I think we could all do without your guesses, Detective. Stick to what little you actually know!

So, when you found the box, it was locked, correct?

Yes, it was. Some of the forensics team took it back to the precinct to crack it open.

Why's that?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Here's absolute proof.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
A... silk hat?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
This was found at the scene of the crime. It belongs to the defendant.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Ah...
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Without question, he was wearing his signature hat during practice. If the clown was the murderer, there would be no reason for this hat to be at the scene.

The witness just testified to the following effect -- Up until the police arrived, he didn't move from the entrance to the plaza. HOWEVER! The witness just stated that he chased after Money the monkey. When the witness was off chasing Money, there was no one watching the plaza!

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well, he obviously didn't see the victim, the Ringmaster, arrive on the scene!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
However, that doesn't change the fact that he saw the defendant arrive!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The witness is lying! He is blinded by his rivalry with Max!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well... The defense's argument does hold water. This witness does have a history of animosity towards the defendant.
</p><p>Trilo:<br/>
<span style="color:green">What!? How dare you!? I wouldn't lie just to get that dorkface in trouble! He's not even worth it!! I saw him! No doubt about it! I saw that worthless liar!</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well... Just for clarity's sake, let's flesh out exactly who you saw on that night.
</p><p>Trilo:<br/>
<span style="color:green">Hah! I've told you so many times, you'd think you'd know my story's not changing!</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(You've already changed your story, stick boy! And I'm sure it will change some more.)</span>
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Where there is one lie, there are usually many more behind it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Exactly, Maya. That's why we have to keep after him!

Yeah!

Hmm...
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
So that means that Money didn't show up until after you saw Max?
</p><p>Trilo:<br/>
<span style="color:green">That's right. Money ran up less than a minute after I saw Max.</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Then Money snatched the ring, and you went chasing after him?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
How long was it until you came back to where you were waiting?

<span style="color:green">Well. Let's see... I'd say about...</span>

I suppose five minutes. I think...

It is my belief that the witness did indeed see someone that night... It was just someone else! That's who he said "good evening" to.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
What kind of theory is that!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The correct one. Furthermore, I don't believe the person the witness saw was Max at all.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Wh-What!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
If he had truly met Max that night, there would have been no greeting at all. Which means there is only one proper answer. The person the witness saw that night was not Maximillion Galactica. That is why Trilo made the effort to greet whoever it was that he saw that evening. Or "good evening" as he put it.
</p><p>Trilo:<br/>
<span style="color:green">Uhh...</span>
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
What in the world... You...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Would the defense kindly explain who it was Trilo saw that evening then?

</p><p>Judge:<br/>
It must be Regina! It's Regina right!? She's so cute!!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
No, Your Honor, it is not Regina. If it was Regina, Trilo would have given her the engagement ring as a present.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Oh... Yeah... I suppose you've got a point there.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
It was Russell Berry. The victim himself, was it not?

You are correct. It was indeed Russell Berry.
</p><p>Trilo:<br/>
<span style="color:green">...!</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The person you saw that evening was the victim, the Ringmaster, Russell Berry. That's why you greeted him Trilo. Isn't that correct?

Answer the question, Mr. Quist!

<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
I think it is high time that we clear the air about this question! Mr. Quist obviously witnessed a <span style="color:#E16935">single person</span> in the area of the plaza that evening. The problem is identifying exactly <span style="color:#E16935">who that person was</span>... Was it Maximillion Galactica? Or was it the Ringmaster, one Mr. Russell Berry?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
The prosecution argues that it was the defendant that the witness saw that night! The witness has clearly stated that he saw the defendant's three symbols!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Three symbols?
</p><p>Trilo:<br/>
<span style="color:green">Alright... This is getting old. C'mon man! You've gotta remember them by now!! Here we go again! Everyone... All together now!! OWWWWW!!</span>

A silk hat and a cloak! Anyone could wear them! They'd even look good on me!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
What was that!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well, the witness has endlessly repeated that he saw Max's three symbols... However, how do we really know it was Maximillion Galactica? It could have been someone else, dressed up as him. Possibly even Russell Berry!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
WHAT!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Ms. von Karma.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Do you have clear evidence that the person the witness saw was the defendant?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Well... I...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
If that's the case, then it is impossible for me to make a judgment at this point.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes! I think we've finally won a point in this one!!)</span>
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
... That is very... Unfortunate.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
You're just a little too excited for your own good, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What do you mean by that?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
You merely established one thing from this witness. You established that this witness saw one person in the plaza that night. I applaud you on your effort, but...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
But...?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Who that person was can only be answered by the next witness!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
HUH!?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Your Honor, the prosecution will provide, beyond a shadow of a doubt, an answer to that question, and evidence that clearly establishes one thing. That there is no one other than Maximillion Galactica responsible for this crime!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well. The court will take a 10 minute recess. During that time, I request the prosecution prepare their next witness. Court is now in recess!

Max:<br/>
Sw-Sweetie! You have to believe me! I didn't go anywhere near that crime scene!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
So then, where were you when the murder took place?
</p><p>Max:<br/>
We talked about it yesterday, remember? I was in the Ringmaster's room!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
And while you were there, it was the Ringmaster who left the room, right?
</p><p>Max:<br/>
Exactly. He told me to wait in the room because he would "be right back".
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
That's when the Ringmaster headed to the scene of the crime... Right?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That's what it seems like.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
But... The Ringmaster must've been wearing <span style="color:#E16935">Max's costume</span>. Right?
</p><p>Max:<br/>
Oh! Sweetie! I just remembered! I went straight to the Ringmaster's room <span style="color:#E16935">still dressed in my stage clothes</span>. But when I got there, I went ahead and took the costume off.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Which means?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It means that the Ringmaster could have taken his costume, and went out looking like Max!
</p><p>Max:<br/>
FABULOUS! That's a fabulously possible possibility!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Heh Heh... Well done, Nick.
</p><p>Max:<br/>
However, sweetie... Why would the Ringmaster want to dress up like me? Isn't that a bit strange?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Hmm...
</p><p>Max:<br/>
If you think about it, all they found at the crime scene was my <span style="color:#E16935">silk hat</span>. What about my <span style="color:#E16935">cloak</span>? Where did that go?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Double hmm...

Moe said that he heard a sound like a "thump" of someone getting hit.

If Moe is to be believed when he says he looked out the window upon <span style="color:#E16935">hearing a sound</span>, there is no way that he could have seen Max "<span style="color:#E16935">clonk</span>" anyone!

Very well. Then please testify to this silhouette you saw... I expect the truth! And if I even catch a hint of a joke from you... I will put you in a holding cell until you learn court etiquette, got it!?

Trilo said the same thing. But if it was just the symbols, then even I could have been wearing them. What if someone had just taken Max's symbols and worn them?

I thought of that myself. But just looking at the shape of the face I saw, it must have been Max.

This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
They aren't, are they...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.

The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!

... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.

That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong this trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Billy Bob Johns...
</p>

Judge:<br/>
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!
