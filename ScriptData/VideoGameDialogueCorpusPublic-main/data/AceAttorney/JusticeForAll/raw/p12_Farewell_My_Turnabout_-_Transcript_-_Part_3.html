</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I-I understand.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Their task is to find the "owner" of this card... A man called Shelly de Killer. And just as his name states, he is a "killer", an <span style="color:#E16935">assassin</span>. The best, at that.

So who is this "Shelly de Killer"?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
"De Killer" is the name of a long standing line of assassins.
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Long standing?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The name first appeared about 100 years ago, I hear. Shelly is the professional name of the third heir to the De Killer name.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So because his professional name is "Shelly", he leaves cards with a shell on them...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
He has a habit of making sure to leave a card by the body of his victims.
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Why would he do something like that...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
We think it is a part of his <span style="color:#E16935">duty</span> to his clients.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
His "duty"?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
If he leaves a card, then his clients can be assured it was he who killed the victim. It also serves as insurance against any charges being pushed onto his clients.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...I see...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
De Killer values the <span style="color:#E16935">trust</span> between his <span style="color:#E16935">clients and himself</span> above all else. It seems that this is one honorable assassin with a moral conscience.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I guess that even honorable assassins can exist...)</span> So, you think this assassin... You think he's the one who did the killing in this case?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It would appear that way. The discovery of the card basically confirms it, wouldn't you agree?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Shelly de Killer, huh...)</span>

Please, stop! ...I can't listen to you. I can't believe that.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The hotel right now is restricted to police personnel only, as we are looking for any clues that might lead us to Shelly de Killer. If you take this with you to the hotel, I'm sure they will let you enter.

Hey now. I never told you any lies. The person who did the killing was that De Killer guy, right? All I'm guilty of is taking a catnap in my room.

Celeste... She was Matt's manager a long time ago. She was the happiest woman in the world at that time. I was working part-time back then, and I often saw the two of them together.

So that's why... "With love... Celeste" is written on the frame of that picture.

They were a couple, weren't they?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
It wasn't anything as splendid as that. Celeste was being used; toyed with until she was... thrown away.
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
That's so horrible...
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Matt's entire image is built around how nice and wonderful of a man he is. A scandal would have destroyed that. Which is why Celeste, in her kindness, moved over to Worldwide Studios. And that is where she met Juan. She seemed really happy with him; even happier than when she was with Matt. Celeste and Juan were such a good match that they were even planning to get married. And then it was suddenly called off. On the night Juan called their marriage off, Celeste... She killed herself. And that's why I framed Matt. It was revenge for Celeste and for myself.

That's it?

Yes...
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
And what sort of relation is this supposed to explain?

W-Well, Ms. Inpax and Mr. Engarde's...
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Before you start, Mr. Wright, perhaps I should first request to see proof that your brain is wired correctly.

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Argh. I can't afford to mess up something as big as this! I need evidence that clearly shows a connection between Ms. Inpax and Mr. Engarde. If I can find that, I can finally get the real story!)</span>

This... This is a photo of Ms. Inpax, correct? She looks younger than when she passed away though.
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
...W...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
"With love... Celeste". This is Ms. Inpax's handwriting, isn't it?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
... Where did you find this...? No, that's alright. It was a rhetorical question...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah, it is. I found this at Mr. Engarde's mansion.
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
... ...And after all this time... My last remaining secret has been revealed...

<p>Andrews:<br/>
I'm sure even you can guess why Juan called the wedding off, right? Matt "confessed" to Juan... about his relationship with Celeste.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I see... So that's what happened.
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
But... Then why did Mr. Corrida have to call off the wedding!? I don't understand at all...
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
It was probably because of his worthless male pride. Juan and Matt were always fierce rivals. Matt waited for the wedding announcement and then unleashed the truth on Juan. He was aiming for when it would hurt Juan the most.
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Poor Ms. Inpax!
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
...That wasn't the end of it. That day, I'm almost certain that Celeste left a suicide note behind. And in that note, she left a detailed account of Matt's various misdeeds, and... So that she would never again be hurt by Matt, she chose... to die. Then, when Juan discovered her body, he hid her note.
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
B-But why would he do that!?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
It's simple. Juan realized that note was a powerful weapon against Matt. And it would be especially damaging to his "refreshing like a spring breeze" image. In any case... With his pride hurt, Juan sought revenge.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Revenge... There's that word again.
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Juan wanted to publicly disclose the contents of that suicide note. At a time that would cause Matt the most damage, of course.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
And that was at the press conference after the stage show...
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
I know all about it, because I heard it all from Juan. It was so I could find out about all this that I drew close to Juan to begin with. They're quite a pair of hideous monsters, aren't they? Even Celeste's death was something for them to use in their game. That night, when I found Juan's body, it was only natural that I thought the murderer was Matt. Those two were always spying on one another, after all. As for me, I was frantically searching for Celeste's suicide note. I wanted to destroy it before it ever went public. I was going to burn it. I had even brought a lighter. But... I couldn't find the suicide note... And that's when revenge crossed my mind. Yes, I was going to bring to them my own kind of cruel revenge. Celeste was killed by those two monsters. So when I stabbed Juan's body with that knife... I didn't feel a single shred of guilt.
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
... And that's all I have to say.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Well, Mr. Wright? Even knowing all this, are you still going to help that... "man"?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
... I... I'm a lawyer...
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
I see. What a foul profession.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
... Thank you very much for your time and for talking with me.
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
It was no big deal. I couldn't sleep anyway.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
