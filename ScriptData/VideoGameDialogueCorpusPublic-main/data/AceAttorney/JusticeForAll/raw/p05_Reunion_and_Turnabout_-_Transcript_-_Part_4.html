Maya:<br/>
Um... Nick...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Did you know that Von Karma's daughter is only 18... Just like me...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Um, yeah. ...Why?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
I was just thinking about how strong she is... I mean, she's been in Germany all this time all by herself, and she's so grown up!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...Yeah, and I'm sure she felt a lot of pressure from her father's reputation.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
...And then you look at me, and, well... I'm the daughter of the Master, but I'm still just a little girl. And on top of that, I'm the suspect in a murder trial.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Um... But I think you're really strong too, Maya, for all you've gone through...)</span>
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Good morning! The two of you look like you're doing well today. I'm happy for you!

Hey! Morning, Pearly!
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
You'll be safe today, Mystic Maya!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Huh? What do you mean?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
My mother is coming today to show her support!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Y-Yeah... Yeah! That's right, Pearly!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Hey, Pearls...
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
...? Yes, Mr. Nick?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Um, do you think you could do me a big favor? Could you channel Mia today too?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Huh? ...I was sort of hoping to sit in the audience today and watch...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...Please. It's very important to me. I don't feel confident enough without her help...
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Mr. Nick! That's enough! You can't show weakness in front of the person you love!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
P-Pearly! N-Not this again...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Please, can you do this for us, Pearls?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Um... Alright. I'll do it. I'll do it for Mystic Maya's sake. See you later, then! I'll leave you two to your alone time!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...Phew, thank goodness.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Nick?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
This way, Pearls won't be able to see today's trial...

<center><span style="color:green">June 22, 10:00 AM<br/>District Court<br/>Courtroom No. 2</span></center>
<p><br/>
Judge:<br/>
Court is now in session for the trial of Maya Fey.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Let's start already. Mr. Phoenix Wright. I look forward to tonight's news with great joy. The image of your defeated face will be transmitted all over the world!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
All over the world, huh? Sounds like you've made quite a name for yourself, Phoenix.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Don't be foolish, you foolish fool wearing the foolishly foolish clothes. The famous one is me! I'm the prodigy who has never lost a case since becoming a prosecutor five years ago. Naturally, the world's eyes are on me, as I conduct my first trial in this country!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Uh, huh... That's nice, Ms. von Karma.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Hmph. Glad to see you're in such good "spirits" today, Ms. Fey.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Uhh... It's true what they say... Women really are scary when they fight... *gulp*)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Now then. A very interesting theory was presented during yesterday's session.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
That the defendant could have left the Channeling Chamber, correct?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes. And this key is proof of that. This key, the only key to the Channeling Chamber, was not where it should have been.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Your Honor, I would like to say one thing before we begin.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
A-Alright... Let's hear it.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
The prosecution has determined that from the time of the murder to the time of arrest, the defendant <span style="color:#E16935">did indeed</span> leave the room at one point.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh-What!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
But... Ms. von Karma! Then... How do you explain this picture? Are you saying then, that the person in this picture is not the defendant...?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
I never said that wasn't the defendant.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Th-Then what is the meaning of this...?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
All I am saying is that Maya Fey, <span style="color:#E16935">after killing the victim</span>, exited the room. And I believe that is when she dropped this key.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Can you substantiate your claim?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Isn't that what I'm here for? The prosecution would like to call the defendant's aunt, Morgan Fey, to the stand.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
...Just as I suspected. Aunt Morgan...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Poor Mia... She seems really torn by this...)</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>von Karma:<br/>
Witness. Name and occupation.
</p><p>Morgan:<br/>
My name is Morgan Fey, and I am a spirit medium, in a manner of speaking...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I'm sorry, but what do you mean, "in a manner of speaking"...? Aaah!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
I don't think anyone really cares. Now then, after the murder took place, you kept watch over the defendant, correct?
</p><p>Morgan:<br/>
Yes, that is correct. I performed the Spirit Severing Technique on Mystic Maya then.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
S-Spirit Severing Technique?
</p><p>Morgan:<br/>
A technique to remove a spirit from a body and send it back to the other world. That is...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes...? That is...? Mmfph!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
You. Be quiet. Now, witness. Something happened while you were performing this technique, correct?
</p><p>Morgan:<br/>
...Yes, that is correct.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh-What in the world could've...!?
</p><p>Morgan:<br/>
Mystic Maya... She escaped from the room...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Wh-What!?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
And here we come to the heart of the matter. Maya Fey, while in a possessed state, managed to escape from the Channeling Chamber!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! Order! Ms. Fey! Please testify to this court what happened during that time!
</p><p>Morgan:<br/>
Your Honor, I will try my best...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
I think someone just upped the ante on this trial...

<hr/>
<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span></center>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- Maya's Escape --</span></center>
<p>Morgan:<br/>
After we heard the gunshots, those two broke the door open and entered the Chamber.<br/>
I requested that Mr. Wright and the other lady please contact the police.<br/>
A pistol was hanging from Mystic Maya's hand and she was in a daze...<br/>
Then, quite suddenly, she thrusted me away from herself and escaped from the room.<br/>
With great strength, she hit the base of my neck and I fainted for a short while...<br/>
I'm afraid I have no knowledge of where she went after that.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
Why have you hidden this until now!?
</p><p>Morgan:<br/>
I... I did not wish to cause more trouble for Mystic Maya. However... I must correct falsities when they arise.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
That's right. She is simply correcting a falsity, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why is she making it a point to take a stab at me... Never mind.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Wright, your cross-examination, please.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
My aunt is a very smart and sly person. It's going to be hard for us to find a crack in her testimony...

Um, Lotta's not a foreigner... despite how she talks...

At that time, I, myself, was a little confused. On top of which, there was another...

Have you forgotten already, Mr. Phoenix Wright? What about this picture!? Remember that at the time, the defendant was not physically "Maya Fey".
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...Ack!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... Growing old is such a mysterious thing. Trust me, I know first-hand.
</p><p>Morgan:<br/>
Basically, Mystic Maya's body was still that of the nurse she had called.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But if she had run away, wouldn't you have given chase right away!?
</p><p>Morgan:<br/>
Well, yes, I would have... however...

I think you can see where this is headed...

<hr/>
<p>von Karma:<br/>
Witness. Name and occupation.
</p><p>Ini:<br/>
Um... OK, so my name is, like, Ini Miney. I'm, like, researching, like, parapsychology stuff at the, um, university.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What is this "parapsychology"?
</p><p>Ini:<br/>
Um... Let's see... It's, like, I guess, most people call it "occult stuff".
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Even if that's what most people call it, I can't say I understand what that means...
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Then I suggest you go home and research it yourself.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes, sir.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Now then, Ms. Miney, after the murder took place, you spoke with the defendant, Maya Fey. Is this correct?
</p><p>Ini:<br/>
Um... Well... Hmm... Like, I guess...
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
If that's the case, then let's hear your testimony. That IS alright, isn't it, Your Honor?

I, like, hadn't seen her in like, so long... I was so happy in, like, a sad way...<br/>
My sister... She, like, told me something, like, totally terrible.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Now hold your horses, young lady! You're saying the person that entered was your <span style="color:#E16935">sister</span>!? Don't you mean the defendant, <span style="color:#E16935">Maya Fey</span>...?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Really, now... Your Honor. Maya Fey was still in the middle of <span style="color:#E16935">channeling</span> at that time.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
A-Are you saying that the spirit was the spirit of this witness's <span style="color:#E16935">sister</span>!?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Yes, Mimi Miney. She was a nurse at Dr. Grey's clinic.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Oh... W-Well... This is...
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Witness.
</p><p>Ini:<br/>
Like, yeah?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
In your testimony, you mentioned a "<span style="color:#E16935">terrible</span>" thing. Why don't you tell the court what this terrible thing was? I'm sure we'd love to hear about it.
</p><p>Ini:<br/>
...Um, like... Do I totally, like, really have to?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Of course.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Ms. Miney... please.
</p><p>Ini:<br/>
... My sister... Like, this is what she said to me.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>That was... no accident... I was drugged... with sleeping pills... I was murdered... by that person... That's why... I took... my revenge... It's only fair... Isn't it... ...Ini?
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
She "<span style="color:#E16935">took her revenge</span>?" Are you sure that's what she said?
</p><p>Ini:<br/>
Y-Yes...
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
There, are you satisfied, Your Honor?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
...I still can't believe it. I can't believe that a spirit would go so far as to use a medium to get revenge...
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
It is a bit hard to swallow, however, all the evidence and testimonies point to this as the truth! ...The end.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
...What do you think, Mr. Wright? It certainly seems like all the loose ends are accounted for...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This... This testimony just now... Was it all made up? Was it just one huge lie...?)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Of course it was, Phoenix.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...Mia! What do you mean?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
It's well constructed... but that's all it is. But even the most well-spun lies can be undone. We can do it, Phoenix. Let's find that one loose thread and unwind this tapestry of lies.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Your Honor! There is room for doubt, so the defense will cross-examine this witness. We believe that our cross-examination will reveal the real truth behind this murder!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Yet again the foolish fool spouts out more foolishly foolish drabble... I wonder if you'll make this one more entertaining than the last...

I think this is what really happened. The murderer had planted herself at the scene of the crime long beforehand. Dressed in a medium's costume and wearing a wig, she pretended to be the defendant. And then, the channeling started. The murderer crept silently towards the other two, both of whom had their eyes closed. ...First, she drugged Maya Fey with a strong sleeping agent. Then, she stabbed Dr. Grey with the knife! Next, she hid my client inside the clothing box... She did that so she could take Maya's place and frame her for the crime.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>

Yes.

Dr. Grey was actually not yet dead! With the last of his strength, he fired a shot at his attacker! And that is why the hole in the folding screen was so low to the ground! The murderer then took the gun from Dr. Grey, and...
</p>
<hr/>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">*bang!*</span></center>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
After that, you and the other lady thought to break into the room...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes, a gunshot is certainly something you wouldn't expect to hear. Which is why, upon hearing the shots, we forced our way into the Channeling Chamber.

I think we have our answer, Mr. Phoenix Wright. What Ms. Miney has stated is very true. The revenge plan is overly complicated, and she has no motive in the first place. Furthermore, there is no reason for Ms. Morgan Fey to cooperate with this plan. You don't even have any truly decisive pieces of evidence to demonstrate your point.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Tsk, tsk. So many faults, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You should really learn your place.

There is something very big here. It's going to be hard to break apart such a natural-sounding testimony. But we have to attack it. And by doing so, a flaw will show itself. It has to.

Ms. Miney. Do you remember this article?

It's an article about the accident. You had said this in it: "But I opened the <span style="color:#E16935">right door</span>, and, like, got out"... That's correct, isn't it?
</p><p>Ini:<br/>
Like, why are you suddenly asking me about that...?

Your Honor. Which side is the passenger's seat: the left or the right?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well, it's on the <span style="color:#E16935">right side</span>, of course, because the driver's on the left side.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That would be if it were an American car. But it would be the <span style="color:#E16935">opposite</span> in a British car.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Opposite...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The two of them were riding in a <span style="color:#E16935">British car</span>! In that case, the passenger side would be the <span style="color:#E16935">left side</span>!

Dr. Grey wanted to call back the spirit of a dead person. Specifically, the spirit of his nurse that died in the crash, <span style="color:#E16935">Mimi Miney</span>.

</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
And... And... And that's why she had to kill Dr. Turner Grey? Is that what you're saying!?

Yes. Before the channeling, Dr. Grey had the misfortune of consulting this witness about communicating with the dead. And in that moment, his fate was sealed!

Mia:<br/>
Congratulations, Maya.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
S-Sis!
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
It's good to see you, Maya... How are you doing?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Sis! Sis... I-I didn't kill anyone, did I?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
No, you didn't. It was all just a dream... A really bad dream.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
You know, sis... In my dream, I smelled a really familiar scent.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
A familiar scent...?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
I was inside that clothing box, right? That box... That was the box you used to store your clothes in a long time ago...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
That's right!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Hmm... There is still one thing I don't quite get.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
What's that?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What would've happened if Mimi hadn't shot Dr. Grey...? I mean, we broke in because we heard a gunshot.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
I think Mimi Miney had planned to open the door to the Chamber herself. And then, you and Lotta would have witnessed quite a scene; a "possessed" Maya Fey, who had just committed a murder.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
She had it planned down to the smallest detail, huh...?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Nick!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Congrats, Maya.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Thanks! Looks like you bailed me out of another jam.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well... you know...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
But... I really don't want something like this to happen ever again.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
I'm fine because I have you to help me out, Nick... But every time something happens, I lose someone special to me. First my sister... And now my aunt...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Hey, Nick... Tell me... Tell me why my aunt went and did something so horrible? Why would she help Ms. Mimi with a plan like that...!? I just... I just don't understand it, Nick...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Maya, it's over. Why don't we just let it be.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Nick, please, I need an answer...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

</p><p>Maya:<br/>
... Pearly?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Four years from now, a new Master will be "born" into Kurain Village. And that person will be you, Maya.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
A-And...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But, if you weren't there... then the main family's bloodline would disappear... And what would happen then...?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
... ...The branch family... My aunt...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...No, Morgan's spiritual power is too weak. The next person would be... Pearls.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
...Aaaah!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Everything was done for her sake. It was all so that Pearls would become the next Master.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Y-Yeah... I can see that... ...

I helped that brainless nurse carry out her murder, and cooperated with that whip-happy prosecutor... It was all to unseat that annoying, witless main family girl...

That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Maya Fey...

The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!
