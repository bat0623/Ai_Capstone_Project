Don't get nervous, Maxy... Here, have a glass of milk.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
R-Regina!!
</p><p>Max:<br/>
How fabulous!! My sweetie pie!! My sweetie pie princess!! You came to watch my performance today?
</p><p>Regina:<br/>
Of course I did! Moe told me that I should come and watch this.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Moe said that...?)</span>
</p><p>Regina:<br/>
So, what kind of performance will you put on today? Lemme guess, you'll fly at the end?
</p><p>Max:<br/>
Uh... It's not kind of show... Isn't that right, my sweeties?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Huh?
</p><p>Max:<br/>
I think my sweetie pie princess doesn't...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah. She doesn't seem to realize what's going on... Or even where she is...
</p><p>Max:<br/>
Hmm...
</p><p>Regina:<br/>
Well, Max, it looks like it's time to raise the curtain. I'll see you later. Today I'm just a member of the audience!
</p><p>Max:<br/>
F-Fabulous! Enjoy yourself out there!!
</p><p>Regina:<br/>
Good luck, Max! You're the best!!

Uhh... Top of the morning.
</p><p>Moe:<br/>
That's the ticket! Attacking the day starts with energy in the morning! The early bird gets the worm. But then again, worms lack higher brain function. Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Here Max! I brought you a present! Have some milk.

</p><p>Moe:<br/>
Be careful... He's used to putting his life on the line. Literally. He's got guts to spare.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
If all I've got to worry about is how thin the tightrope is, I'm used to it already... It just means that I won't be able to press him like I can other witnesses...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
What are you going to do then, Nick!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I guess today we'll just have to do without our psychological warfare. Today we rely on <span style="color:#E16935">evidence</span>. It's the only way we'll get past Acro and to the truth.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
You're right... But it's gonna be tough...
</p><p>Moe:<br/>
Anyways... I want you to make sure that Regina see it all today. It's important. Then she'll finally have to deal with the <span style="color:#E16935">reality</span> of what happened to her father.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
You want us to make sure Regina watches?
</p><p>Moe:<br/>
Yes. That's why I brought her here to court today.
</p><p>Max:<br/>
What's that supposed to mean?
</p><p>Moe:<br/>
She need to know that when people die, they don't just become stars. I may be an old-fashioned clown, but I don't believe in people becoming stars.

</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What's the meaning of this?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
We have discovered a new witness. Or shall I say, a new eyewitness. One that saw Maximillion Galactica fly off from the scene of the crime.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! I had a feeling something like this would come up...
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Due to this revision, we are now prepared to explain how the defendant flew that night. An explanation the prosecution will present if the need so <i>[sic]</i> arises... In fact, my detective stayed up all night creating a mockup of the scene, on my orders.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Poor Gumshoe...)</span>

Name and occupation.
</p><p>Acro:<br/>
Ken Dingling, but everyone calls me Acro. I'm employed as an acrobat at the Berry Big Circus.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Where were you the night of the crime?
</p><p>Acro:<br/>
I was in my room that night.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
If you look at the map, you will see the witness' room is near the crime scene.
</p><p>Acro:<br/>
My room is on the third floor. The crime scene is below my window.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm...
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
The night of the crime, the witness saw something quite shocking. Would you tell us what you witnessed?
</p><p>Acro:<br/>
OK...

<p>Acro:<br/>
It was just after 10:00 PM, and I was resting in my bed.<br/>
Around that time, I heard a large "THUMP" noise from outside the window.<br/>
Then a few moments later, I saw someone... flying... Right by my window.<br/>
It was Max Galactica... I only saw him from behind, but that's who it looked like.<br/>
To be honest, when I saw that, I thought I was dreaming...
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... This witness's testimony matches up exactly with that of the clown.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
If that's the case, there is very little the prosecution need add... All that's left is to explain how the defendant disappeared into the sky that night.

Before we get that far, I'd like to cross-examine the witness.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
A foolish choice by a foolish fool who wishes to feel the foolish sadness of a sad fool. A man must know the proper timing for things, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Just like your old friend, Mr. Miles Edgeworth did.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Wright. Do you have a problem with the witness' testimony?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
In the words of Ms. von Karma, may I quote yesterday's proceedings... "There's no way that actually happened!"
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Very well... You may proceed with your cross-examination.

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You said that you were resting in bed. One would thus assume that you turned the lights off in your room, correct?
</p><p>Acro:<br/>
That's correct. But there are safety lights around the outside of the lodging house. It's so bright, sometimes it can make it hard to sleep...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
If that's the case, wouldn't it be a good idea to close some curtains?
</p><p>Acro:<br/>
... I never really thought of that. I guess that means I'm off to buy some curtains.

Hah hah... Sometimes I do make myself useful in these chambers. OWWW!!

The sound of you getting caught in your own trap! What a splendid accomplice. I'm sure this accusation is built on a solid foundation.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Foundation...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes, Mr. Wright... Do you have proof that this person you've accused was indeed an accomplice?

<p>Acro:<br/>
I suppose I could have lifted something the size of that bust.<br/>
I have a strong upper body from working as an acrobat, and only my legs were injured.<br/>
However, lifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible.<br/>
There's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body.<br/>
That makes it impossible for me to have known the location of the Ringmaster's head.<br/>
Thus it would be unrealistic to drop the bust on him. Don't you think?

Then he attached that rope to the <span style="color:#E16935">bust</span>, and dangled the bust out of his bedroom window, <span style="color:#E16935">directly above the wooden box</span>. At the same time, the Ringmaster told Max to wait in his room, and went to the scene. Of course, at the time, the Ringmaster was wearing <span style="color:#E16935">Max's costume</span>. Perhaps he didn't want anyone to recognize him that night. But just as he feared, he was spotted at the entrance of the lodging house. By none other than a ventriloquist and his puppet, Ben and Trilo. When the Ringmaster arrived at the scene, he bent over to lift the wooden box. And that's when Acro took his chance and released the rope! Now this is when the magic happens... At the very <span style="color:#E16935">instant that the bust hit</span> the victim...
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
You just wait a second there, Mr. Phoenix Wright!! As much as you try... As much as you scheme... This just isn't true! It can't be!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It's still a little early to be getting so upset, Ms. von Karma... This circus isn't over yet.

When Moe looked out his window, the cloak had already snagged onto the bust. Now... Having completed the crime, Acro naturally went about <span style="color:#E16935">pulling up the murder weapon</span>. Of course, he had no idea that <span style="color:#E16935">Moe saw the bust</span> being raised with the <span style="color:#E16935">cloak dangling on it</span>. Primarily because, in his wheelchair, he couldn't see out of his window. So he just kept pulling the bust up. And that is how the "magical murderer disappearing into the sky" came to be.

You've graced us with a rather long-winded tale... But do you have any evidence to prove that your fairy tale is <span style="color:#E16935">true</span>!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
... E-Evidence...?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
In this court, only two things matter. The power of evidence, and the power of my whip.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Don't forget the power of my gavel as well! Mr. Wright, the prosecution brings up a good point. Can we see some evidence?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Nick... They say they want evidence...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I just explained how there can only be one possible murder method. But there is still <span style="color:#E16935">something unusual</span> about Moe's eyewitness account.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
"Unusual"?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
A <span style="color:#E16935">contradiction</span>, actually.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
OK then! Use that and get out of this jam!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
That's enough talking amongst yourselves. Proceed, Mr. Wright. Present some evidence to the court that backs your claims. I want <span style="color:#E16935">hard proof</span> that you have <span style="color:#E16935">unraveled the trick</span> to this magic case...!

<p>Phoenix:<br/>
The problem is <span style="color:#E16935">Max's three symbols</span>... You know... The silk hat, the cloak, and the white roses.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Those symbols were a problem numerous times during yesterday's proceedings.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yesterday, there were <span style="color:#E16935">two contradictions</span> in Moe's testimony.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
The <span style="color:#E16935">silk hat</span> was one. The <span style="color:#E16935">white roses</span> were the other.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But the theory I just presented explains all of these contradictions!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
You fool! Do you ever shut up!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Max's silk hat was found at the scene of the crime. However! Remember what Moe said yesterday. He testified that the criminal he saw fleeing the scene was <span style="color:#E16935">wearing a silk hat</span>! There's only one explanation for that! <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [The 'silk hat' that Moe saw was actually the bust!] in the original release">The "silk hat" that Moe saw was actually the bust's!</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [The 'silk hat' that Moe saw was actually the bust!] in the original release)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Makes sense... If you look at it that way, then he did see the silk hat, well, sort of.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
<span class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:File"><a class="mw-file-description image" href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445"><img class="mw-file-element lazyload" data-image-key="Objection.gif" data-image-name="Objection.gif" data-relevant="0" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/aceattorney/images/7/75/Objection.gif/revision/latest?cb=20080826215445" decoding="async" height="192" loading="lazy" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" width="260"/></a></span>
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Fine, you've got one, but what about the other contradiction!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The other contradiction...?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Remember what that ventriloquist said in court! He said that he witnessed "<span style="color:#E16935">white roses</span>" on "Max's" chest that night! But the clown's testimony doesn't match! The clown said that there were <span style="color:#E16935">no</span> "white roses"! I'd like to see you try and explain that one away!!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Can you do it, Nick!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Of course! I can explain all of it!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
What was that...!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Please recall the instant when the cloak snagged onto the bust! If the cloak snagged onto the bust, what happened to the white roses? Do you get it yet? If the cloak got snagged onto the front of the bust... It means that the white roses would end up on the <span style="color:#E16935">back of the bust</span>!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
AHHHHH!!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [Which explains why Moe didn't see it!] in the original release">Which explains why Moe didn't see them!</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [Which explains why Moe didn't see it!] in the original release)</span> The white roses were not visible because they were on the <span style="color:#E16935">back side of the bust</span>!

<p>Judge:<br/>
... This is quite the shocking state of affairs. Mr. Wright's theory still sounds a bit absurd to me. However... Let's just keep going down this road for a while and see where it leads!

Let's do this, Nick! Then maybe Von Karma will finally throw in the towel...
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>

</p><p>Acro:<br/>
...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Well... So much for that theory.
</p><p>Acro:<br/>
Mr. Wright... Do you mind?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What is it?
</p><p>Acro:<br/>
You took the time to research our circus, didn't you?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well... Yes, I did... Is there something making you think that I didn't?
</p><p>Acro:<br/>
If you did, then maybe you'll understand why I think you're off track.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Umm... Why is that?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Motive. This witness feels an incredible debt of gratitude towards the Ringmaster. Anyone with any relation to the circus is well aware of this.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Thus, there is absolutely no way someone like this would kill the Ringmaster!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm...
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Your Honor, I'd like you to hear Acro's story! Learn about his relationship with the Ringmaster, and his life up until now...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
W-What do we do!? There's no doubting that Acro deeply respected the Ringmaster!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Acro's motive... Hmm...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
It seems that this case isn't over yet... Very well. However, I feel this is a good place to take a break. I will listen to the rest of Mr. Dingling's testimony after recess.

That's when the Ringmaster of the Berry Big Circus, Russell Berry, took us in.<br/>
I became an acrobat at around nine years old.<br/>

<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... You're such a thoughtful young man.

How would you describe your relationship with the Ringmaster?
</p><p>Acro:<br/>
He was like an uncle, a father, and a big brother all rolled up into one. The Ringmaster and my brother were the only family I had...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... What about other people at the circus?
</p><p>Acro:<br/>
This was over 15 years ago... Back then, there were very few customers coming in, so no one really had the time to look after us. They were worried about other things. But the Ringmaster... He would always come see us with a laugh and a smile.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
What a beautiful story...
</p><p>Acro:<br/>
That's why I was always thinking of what I could do to help. I wanted to thank him.

It's the truth, Your Honor. It isn't a theory. Simply put, Regina didn't think the note was meant for her. Which is why, the morning of the crime, she placed it on the cafeteria bulletin board.

That's correct. The Ringmaster ended up in that plaza <span style="color:#E16935">instead of Regina</span>! And he was killed because of that mistake... Instead of Regina!!

Lifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible. There's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body. If I were to do that, I'd end up falling out the window myself.

<p>Phoenix:<br/>
Acro had no idea <span style="color:#E16935">who</span> it was that arrived in the plaza... Because he couldn't look down out of his window to see who it actually was.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I've got it! I've got it! Acro thought it was <span style="color:#E16935">Regina</span> down in the plaza...

And that's when he let the bust fly.

Hey, Nick... Isn't Regina listening to all of this from the audience?

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Of course I do! It's the truth. The lion sneezed due to the pepper, and that's when Bat... lost consciousness. Acro nearly lost his brother due to this accident! Or this "joke", as you put it. Which is why he tried to get his revenge... against Regina.

</p><p>Acro:<br/>
... Mr. Wright. Unfortunately, your imagination is not enough to find me guilty of murder.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
... What do you mean by that?
</p><p>Acro:<br/>
The pepper... The scarf... The lion... ...I see where you're going, but it's a bit hard to swallow... Not to mention the fact that there's an even bigger problem with your theory.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What would that problem be?
</p><p>Acro:<br/>
The same problem it's always been... Evidence. If I dropped Max's bust on top of the Ringmaster... Where is the evidence that proves that claim?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Uhhh...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... You mean the "conclusive evidence"?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
The biggest problem is the <span style="color:#E16935">murder weapon</span>, or the lack thereof to be more precise.

Acro... I'm sorry to ask this, but do you mind if I take the blanket off your wheelchair?
</p><p>Acro:<br/>
... I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear you, Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well... You are a big guy... And you have a pretty big wheelchair because of it... I just wanted to make sure you weren't hiding anything under that blanket. Because it seems to me that it'd be really easy to say... <span style="color:#E16935">hide a bust under there</span>...
</p><p>Acro:<br/>
...Hah hah hah hah hah... Once again, your penchant for humor hits me where it hurts, Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I think it's pretty amazing that you could laugh in your position... However, your lightheartedness doesn't change the fact that the bust is under there.
</p><p>Acro:<br/>
...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
We all know that you couldn't leave the lodging house by yourself in your condition. That proved inconvenient when Ms. von Karma happened to <span style="color:#E16935">search your room</span> yesterday. If she had found the murder weapon in your room, it would have been all over. Which is why you had to hide it. In the only place that you could hide it... Under your wheelchair.
</p><p>Acro:<br/>
...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Which is why, Acro, I have to ask you again. <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [Could you please remove the blanket from the wheelchair?] in the original release">Would you please remove the blanket from your lap?</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [Could you please remove the blanket from the wheelchair?] in the original release)</span>

</p><p>Acro:<br/>
Ms. Franziska von Karma and Mr. Phoenix Wright.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...What!?
</p><p>Acro:<br/>
There's just one think I'd like to know... How did you know to launch the surprise search on my room last night?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...?
</p><p>Acro:<br/>
There were two decisive pieces of evidence... The cloak and the bust... I burned the cloak in my room and threw the ashes away with the trash. ...Regina always took my trash out every morning, you know. But the bust... Obviously I couldn't throw that away. When you executed your search, all I could do was try and hide the bust. And the only place that I could hide it quickly was under this wheelchair... Ms. von Karma, you had things all figured out, didn't you? I was completely sucked in by your calculated strategy... And now to be caught in the middle of court hiding the murder weapon... ...There's no way I can escape that. So you've got me. Well done, Mr. Wright. Well done, Ms. von Karma.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... It all makes sense now.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
I can't believe that Von Karma thought that far ahead... It's amazing!

Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.

That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong this trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Billy Bob Johns...

The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!
