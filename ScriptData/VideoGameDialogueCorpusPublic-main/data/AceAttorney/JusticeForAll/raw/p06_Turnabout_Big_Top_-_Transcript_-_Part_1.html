Of course I did! But I don't really understand what everyone means by "express train".

Well, Nick... See you later. I'll come by to help clean the office. It's gotta be spotless for the new year.

</p><p>Max:<br/>
... Anyways... I've been curious about something for a while now.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
What's that?
</p><p>Max:<br/>
Why do you keep looking at me with such a sad look on your face, sweetie?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Be-Because! You've been arrested! For murder!
</p><p>Max:<br/>
Oh, don't be ignorant. They wouldn't arrest someone like me!!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Why is that?
</p><p>Max:<br/>
Obviously because I'm the fabulous Maximillion Galactica!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So?
</p><p>Max:<br/>
I'm the very big star of the Berry Big Circus.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
And that means?
</p><p>Max:<br/>
I'm rich. I'm paid fabulous sums!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Which means what?
</p><p>Max:<br/>
...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Max...
</p><p>Max:<br/>
Quit joking around! You've got to be pulling my magic wand! The police aren't really serious about all this, are they?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
They don't arrest people as a joke.
</p><p>Max:<br/>
...!!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Look at Max... He's crushed...

Please! Help me! I didn't kill nobody!

I may be more spoiled than a hog in a hamburger mud pit... But a killer!? That's insane... I... I... I could never...

M-Max?

I swear!! I just wanted to pay off my daddy's debt... He's back on the farm...

Yep. Last night around 10 PM. He died outside in the cold. A pretty sad way to go out if you ask me, pal.

Yes. You work at the circus don't you?

N-No. I'm just your everyday average Joe.

The Ringmaster was truly ahead of his time. He would always add new elements to the show.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
New elements...?
</p><p>Moe:<br/>
When you've been a performer for a long time, your act starts getting a bit stale.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Hmm...
</p><p>Moe:<br/>
I realize that even my act can get a bit long in the tooth... Sometimes my jokes can be a bit... Umm... Old-fashion.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
"A bit long in the tooth?"
</p><p>Moe:<br/>
But that make-believer takes things too far!!
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Make-believer?
</p><p>Moe:<br/>
The magician!! The one that thinks he's all high and mighty!! He had the gall to say to me, "You're one of those funny types, right?" What does he mean "one of those"!? Well the joke's on him now...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
On him...?
</p><p>Moe:<br/>
Yep! He got on everyone's nerves!! The day of the murder... ...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Go ahead.
</p><p>Moe:<br/>
Nope. No way! Just forget I said anything!

That night... Once I had tucked myself into bed, I heard this amazing noise. It was incredibly loud. It sounded like a giant "THUMP"! Once I heard it, I jumped out of bed. That's when I saw... Without question. Without a doubt. It was that magician!! That's all I saw... But it just proves how terrible that man actually is!

You met with the Ringmaster on the night of the murder?

Yes. I was with him around 10 PM. Once I was done with practice. I went to his room right after we finished.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
They found the Ringmaster's body in the plaza in front of the lodging house.
</p><p>Max:<br/>
Yeah, I head<span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="[sic]">*</span></span><span style="display: none;"> ([sic])</span> about that... He needed to step out for a bit, so I waited in his room for him to return.

</p><p>Max:<br/>
I waited for him. But he never came back...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Did he go to the plaza where the body was discovered?
</p><p>Max:<br/>
Possibly. The snow had tapered off a bit, but it was still very cold outside. But I have no idea what he went off to do...

The truth is... Yesterday morning during breakfast, we had a run in.

You mean you had a fight with Ben the ventriloquist?
</p><p>Max:<br/>
You could put it that way.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Why did you fight with him? Ben seems like such a quiet man.
</p><p>Max:<br/>
We fought about my sweetie pie.

You mean Regina?

That ill-bred creep told my sweetie pie princess that he was in love with her! Would you put up with that?

All I can say is that he made me mad and I had to tap him on his hard head! That's when the Ringmaster called me and I realized that it was my chance!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Your chance?
</p><p>Max:<br/>
That's when I went to his room and I laid it all out on the table. I asked him to "Let me marry my sweetie pie!"

What!?
</p><p>Max:<br/>
The Ringmaster told me that it "sounds good to me!" That's why my sweetie pie is MY sweetie pie! And no one else's!

You can see the Big Top from the window here.

There is no snow on top of the Big Top... Kinda weird don't you think?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The inside of the tent is warm so any snow that lands on top probably melts.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
I guess you're right. The snow probably just slides right off.

I think so... Monkeys live life above the rim you know.

Of course. That monkey doesn't fake the funk on a nasty dunk.
