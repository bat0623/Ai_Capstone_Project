The shot was fired from point-blank range.<br/>

The wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.<br/>

That is quite true... Mr. Wright.

Y-Yes?

Even in the face of all this, do you still wish to plead "not guilty"? It's the opinion of this court that if you do not adjust your plea, you stand to lose.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
See, just as I promised, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You would change your plea in less than ten minutes...

What will you do, Mr. Wright? Will you change to "justified self-defense"? Because now would be the time to do so. This is your final chance.

As if that was even possible. According to testimony, the wound from the stabbing was very severe. The victim would not have had the strength to push the defendant very far after that!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...! W-Well... Then... That's right! The defendant must have pushed the victim away! After stabbing him, she must have put some space between the doctor and herself. And then while she was preparing to strike again, the doctor took his shot. There. That sound satisfy even you.

And that is exactly what is so odd. Something that should be there is suddenly missing.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
"Should be there"...? Aaaaah!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
There was a <span style="color:#E16935">bullet hole</span> in the sleeve of the defendant's costume! If that's the case, then it should be in this picture as well!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Ms. von Karma!! Y-You... You intended to hide this valuable piece of evidence!?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You will most certainly be assigned a penalty for this!

</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Don't celebrate yet.

Take a look at Ms. von Karma's face.

</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...Tsk, tsk, jumping the gun again, I see. Your Honor! I would like to extend an apology on behalf of those incompetent fools.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Wh-What do you mean? And what "incompetent fools"...?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
If those fools down at the precinct hadn't missed the bullet hole, I would have gotten a report about it. As I didn't, I could not have known that this picture was of any value to this case.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm, I see...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(She's lying through her teeth! I know it! That woman knew about everything! The bullet hole, the picture -- everything!)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
But you can't prove that. Franziska von Karma's idea of a "perfect case" is quite fascinating, don't you think?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Your Honor. You need not worry. If you must assign a penalty, I'll personally make sure that detective gets what's coming. I'm sure there will be a great gnashing of teeth at the next salary discussion.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Poor Gumshoe...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
In any case, this is a very big problem! When the defendant was taken into custody, her costume had a bullet hole in its sleeve. However, from this photo, it would appear that right after the shooting, there was none!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...

The judge is confused by this strange twist of events. This is your chance, Phoenix! Load all you've got into this one shot, alright!?

Got it! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Watch this, Maya!)</span> Your Honor! There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction!

That's right! Now hurry up and answer, Mr. Phoenix Wright!

Oh... One of a kind, you say?
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
...! Wait... Mr. Phoenix Wright...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes? <span style="color:#0070C0">(It looks like she's catching on...)</span>
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
I'm afraid to ask, but... Why is that key currently in your possession?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Huh? What do you mean?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
If Maya Fey locked herself in, then the key should have been with <span style="color:#E16935">her</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes, agreed.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
However, she did not have the key at the time of her arrest!
</p><p>Lotta:<br/>
Aah! Well, ain't that a kick! So how come you're holdin' it!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I got this as a present from a certain little girl. And that little girl was nowhere near the crime scene at the time!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
Th-Th-That's preposterous!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
This means that Maya Fey must have left the room! If she had not, then I would not be holding this key you see before you!
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
N-Nooooooo!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
It seems we have come to an impasse. This picture has clearly captured the face of the murderer. However, is <span style="color:#E16935">this person</span> the defendant or not? The defense is arguing that this person is not the defendant. Furthermore, as proof, this key has been submitted as evidence. Ms. von Karma.
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
How. Can. This. Be!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
<span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [At this point in time, a verdict on the defendant is not possible.] in the original release">At this point in time, a verdict on the defendant's guilt is not possible.</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [At this point in time, a verdict on the defendant is not possible.] in the original release)</span>
</p><p>von Karma:<br/>
My perfect case! How is there a flaw in my perfect case! Don't think you've won yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright! I am a prodigy! I have never lost a case! And I don't intend to lose here in this courtroom to a fool like you! I don't care what I have to do... I will get my guilty verdict!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
That's enough! If you would like to continue, do so in the lobby. Court will reconvene tomorrow at 10 AM. That is all. Court is adjourned.

Woooow! That was you Pearly!? You summoned my sis!?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Yes. I felt I had no choice...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Great going, Pearly! I knew you were special! Hey, Nick, did you know?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Umm, yeah. It's not like anyone else in there could have done that.)</span>
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Hmm, Nick... I know you're trying really hard and all, but... I really don't remember ever leaving that room.
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
And I don't think that a third person... could have gone into that room.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Y-Yeah... Well, at least we have until tomorrow to figure things out. Like, what happened in that room, for instance.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Yeah. I'm counting on you!
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Ah... I envy the two of you...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Oh, by the way, Nick. Do you think you could take Pearly back home for me?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Sure. Alright, Pearls. You ready to go buy some tickets?
</p><p>Pearl:<br/>
Huh? A tik-ket?

That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Maya Fey...

The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!
