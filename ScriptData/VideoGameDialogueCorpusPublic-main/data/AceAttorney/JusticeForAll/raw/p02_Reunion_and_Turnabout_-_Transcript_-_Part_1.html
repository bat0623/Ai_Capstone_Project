???:<br/>
What depressing rain... Do you understand how depressed that makes me!? Do you!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Uh, I guess...
</p><p>???:<br/>
But actually, more than being depressed, I'm angry. Angry at that weather girl on TV. "I think our little rainy spell will take a break with a day of sun!"...is what that girl said! I'd stake my life on it!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well, it's the weather...
</p><p>???:<br/>
But that's why I didn't bother to bring an umbrella today. What nerve, calling herself a weather girl! She's going to hear about my $1500 suit!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Um... About your case... Unless you're planning on suing the weather girl...?
</p><p>???:<br/>
... I'm sorry. I thought that before we got down to business, we could have some friendly chatter. My name is Dr. Turner Grey. I'm a surgeon.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Remind me never to end up under his knife...)</span>
</p><p>Grey:<br/>
I'm here today because of this incident.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
"Malpractice at Grey Surgical Clinic. Fourteen In-Patients Lose Their Lives!" ...Oh. You're... the doctor at...?
</p><p>Grey:<br/>
It's really quite upsetting. Did you hear me!? UPSETTING!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes, yes, I heard you. I agree, it's quite upsetting, Dr. Grey.
</p><p>Grey:<br/>
The one that screwed up was that nurse! It was her that got the medications mixed up and killed those 14 patients! And yet! Now listen good! And yet! That nurse had the nerve to go and die before admitting to her wrongdoing! She didn't even offer any sort of explanation to me! And this is the kicker! She up and has herself a grand ol' accident and crashed her car! Smash! Crunch! Instantly transforming her car into the accordion model!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That's right... About a year ago, all the tabloid shows were talking about it. Fourteen victims of medical malpractice and the nurse's mysterious fatal accident. There were rumors that Dr. Grey had actually caused that crash. People said it was to forever hide the person responsible for the malpractice incident.)</span>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Grey:<br/>
Why would I...? Now, I'm just going to say this once -- Why on Earth would I want to kill that nurse? She's the one who killed those 14 patients! Not me!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I think you need to take a deep breath, doctor, and focus... More to the point, this case is over a year old. Why bring it up now...?
</p><p>Grey:<br/>
That's simple! Because the situation is slipping out of my grasp. This just won't do. My clinic isn't seeing nearly as many patients nowadays. Do you understand what that means!? It means they're not coming to my clinic!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(You don't say...? If it were me, I don't think I'd want to go either.)</span> So... what would you like me to do about it...?
</p><p>Grey:<br/>
I want you to help me prove I'm innocent.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Um, you do realize I'm a lawyer, not a private investigator, right?
</p><p>Grey:<br/>
No, this is something only you can do.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...?
</p><p>Grey:<br/>
Maya Fey. You know this girl, correct?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Maya! Why would he know her name...!?)</span>
</p><p>Grey:<br/>
I heard you were working under her for a little while.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well, yes... I mean... Hey, wait a second here! I worked <span style="color:#E16935">UNDER her</span>!?
</p><p>Grey:<br/>
Yes. Am I wrong? She told me, so I'm not quite sure if...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Well, we worked a few trials together. But she went back to her hometown to undergo more training.
</p><p>Grey:<br/>
Ah, yes, I heard. It must be lonely for you.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh-What!? Wait... I'm not...!
</p><p>Grey:<br/>
She must be an extraordinary girl to handle such rigid training.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Huh?
</p><p>Grey:<br/>
I have an acquaintance who knows a lot about these mystical sorts of things. She's the one who introduced me to Ms. Fey.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Is Maya... really that famous...?)</span>
</p><p>Grey:<br/>
And I've already set up an appointment.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
For what?
</p><p>Grey:<br/>
What else!? A channeling! I'm going to have her call the spirit of that nurse that went and got herself killed!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
O-Oh. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Maya... I wonder what she's up to right now...)</span>

</p><p>Grey:<br/>
Not counting training, this will be her first time channeling a spirit, so she gave me one condition before accepting my request.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
A condition...?
</p><p>Grey:<br/>
The condition is you, Mr. Wright. She said that she wouldn't do the channeling without first seeing you again.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Me...?
</p><p>Grey:<br/>
And that is why I've searched you out! You want to see her too, don't you!?

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hm? Someone else is coming this way...)</span>
</p><p>???:<br/>
Niiiiiiiick!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
M-Maya. How are you...? It's good to see you again.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Wow, I didn't think you'd really show up!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It's not that big a deal. You made it sound like you were soooo far away.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Well, maybe I exaggerated... just a little.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It was only 2 hours by train. If I had known you were this close, I'd have visited more.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
No! You're not allowed. I already decided, you know. Until I become an adult, I have to work hard and be strong by myself...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Oh... well... Anyway, congratulations. I'm glad to hear training is going well for you.

The tabloids.

Yes, a confession. Pay attention! I'll have her write this: "One year ago, on May 2nd, 14 patients died due to my negligence.

</p><p>Lotta:<br/>
Being an occult photographer. That's some scary stuff, so I think I'm gonna try being a <span style="color:#E16935">celebrity photographer</span>, now.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

Wh-What is it?

I took some <span style="color:#E16935">hot pictures</span> earlier!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
L-Lotta!
</p><p>Lotta:<br/>

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
"<span style="color:#E16935">Spirit Severing Technique</span>"?

By the way, what is this room exactly...?

The Channeling Chamber? This room was created for the sole purpose of preventing such a tragedy as yesterday.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What do you mean?
</p><p>Morgan:<br/>
Sometimes, when an inexperienced medium calls an especially strong spirit, that spirit may become violent and revolt, as you witnessed yesterday.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Revolt? But how?
</p><p>Morgan:<br/>
When a spirit enters a medium's body, she loses her will and her self steps aside. To put it another way, the spirit is borrowing the medium's body, good sir.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But isn't that extremely dangerous?
</p><p>Morgan:<br/>
An experienced medium has little problem controlling a spirit.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But Maya... I mean, Mystic Maya... That was her first channeling...

In this world, Pearl is my most treasured possession. When compared to even Mystic Maya, Pearl has the spiritual power to become a Master.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Th-That's very impressive.
</p><p>Morgan:<br/>
Until now, the women of the branch family have thought themselves to be inferior. .. But. Pearl is different! Her spiritual strength is so great; even greater than some of the main family! Yes, Pearl is a channeling prodigy and is the pride of the branch family!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Wow... She's really fired up now...)</span>
</p><p>Morgan:<br/>
In any case... Our world is so different from yours, perhaps it is best for you to quit, good sir.

"Quit"? Quit what?
