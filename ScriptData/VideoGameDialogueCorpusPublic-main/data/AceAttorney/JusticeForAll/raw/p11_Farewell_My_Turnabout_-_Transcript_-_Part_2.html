I'm certain there is someone out there trying very hard to pin this whole thing on you.

Court is now in session for the trial of Matt Engarde. Are the prosecution and defense ready?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The defense is ready, Your Honor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>

Sh-Shot!?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Somehow... I think this is the "present" that man was talking about.

...Your Honor... Due to the circumstances, Ms. Franziska von Karma can not appear in court today. I, Miles Edgeworth, will be taking her place. The prosecution is ready... naturally.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Ms. von Karma was shot in her right shoulder, and is currently undergoing surgery. Luckily, I have looked this case over and am familiar with the details. The prosecution seeks to prove the guilt of Mr. Matt Engarde.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Th-The court acknowledges the prosecution.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...Wright. I finally found the answer I was struggling for on my long journey this past year. By the time this case comes to an end, you too, will know the answer.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Now then, the prosecution would like to call its first witness... Please bring Detective Gumshoe to the witness stand!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Witness, your name and occupation.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm a detective down at the precinct... for now.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
"For now"...?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
After this trial's over... I'm supposed to turn in my badge, sir.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(D-Detective Gumshoe...)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The prosecution has no need for a depressed witness. Lift your head up and face forward like a proud officer, Detective Dick Gumshoe!
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Y-Yes, sir!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Now, let's have your testimony. If we want to explore the various facets of this case, we must start with that.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Get ready, Phoenix. This is going to be one very rough fight.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yeah... It would have to be with Edgeworth as my opponent.  <span style="color:#0070C0">(The answer he was "struggling" for... Interesting... Show me this "answer" you finally found, Edgeworth...)</span>

This murder happened after the Hero of Heroes award ceremony, sir.<br/>
The victim, Juan Corrida, was found dead in his hotel room.<br/>
After looking into the cause of death, we believe he was definitely murdered, sir.<br/>
At first, we thought there was something suspicious about the empty guitar case.<br/>
However, we later found out that the guitar case had nothing to do with the murder.
</p>

<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... After the award ceremony ended, the victim was alone in his room...?

Yes, sir! Both the victim and defendant went alone to their rooms, sir.

Would you please give us a brief timeline of what happened after the ceremony?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
OK, pal. The ceremony started at 6 PM. It ended around 8 PM... and then there was a short break. A special post-ceremony show was supposed to start in the lobby 30 minutes later.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
And that's when the victim's body was found, correct?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Which is to say, the murder occurred during that thirty minute break period.

The bright red guitar was eventually found at the TV studio. The victim, Juan Corrida, had apparently only taken the case with him, sir.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
So you mean he forgot to put the guitar inside the case...?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yes, sir. Even when he was onstage for the ceremony, he didn't have his guitar.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
So that guitar case was empty even before he got to the hotel...
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yeah, that's right. So it really had nothing to do with the case after all.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm...

Maybe. However, setting off traps is a part of a lawyer's job too.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I believe that is enough. First, the victim was choked to death with his bandana. Then, after the victim was dead, the killer deliberately stabbed him with a knife.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Which brings me to my next point. Why then, did the police arrest Matt Engarde...? Because there was reason enough to suspect him.

<p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Matt Engarde and Juan Corrida were huge rivals with each other.<br/>
They each thought the other guy was "in his way". That's motive enough in my book.<br/>
As for evidence... There's the Jammin' Ninja's button.<br/>
It was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's "hakama".<br/>
The defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.<br/>
The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... So the defendant's fingerprints were found on the knife used in the stabbing.
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
It was sort of sticky on the handle, so the fingerprints came out pretty clearly, sir.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Knife added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
...And there's this button.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
That was found in the defendant's clothes, was it? Hmm... And is this button also covered in blood...?
</p><p>Gumshoe:<br/>
Yes, and we know that the blood on it is the <span style="color:#E16935">victim's</span> blood, sir.

Yes, it most certainly does, Your Honor. Ready to give in yet, Wright?

The button was attached to the costume by thread, obviously. And that thread snapped when the button was torn off. If you match up the ends of the thread on the costume with the thread on the button... it's a perfect match.

The question is... Where did this knife come from?

Wh-Why that's obvious! It came from the victim, Mr. Corrida's room...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Sorry, Your Honor, but that is incorrect. The victim ate a last meal before he was murdered. With that being the case... I would like to draw the court's attention to what is on top of the table.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
There is a knife and a fork on the table! Then... Where in the world did this knife come from!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
If it pleases the court... I would like for us to recall the room of the defendant, Mr. Matt Engarde. Especially what was on top of his table... There is something missing... Perhaps, it is a single knife? We investigated the leftover dishes for fingerprints, and while we were investigating, we came to the conclusion that <span style="color:#E16935">Mr. Matt Engarde's knife</span> was missing.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Urk...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Mr. Engarde had gone to the victim's room with the knife he had used during dinner. Why would he carry a knife on a visit? To kill, of course. And with that, I believe the prosecution has proven... This was a premeditated murder.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Amazing, Mr. Edgeworth. Absolutely brilliant. A brilliantly clear deduction.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
It seems like Edgeworth had this planned from the very beginning...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This must be one of those "traps", and I just walked headlong into it!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
A murder weapon with fingerprints, and a button from the victim's costume. There is quite a sizable amount of evidence here.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I can safely say that any further deliberation is a waste of Your Honor's time. Although... I wouldn't mind if the defense were to present evidence not yet shown to the court.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Evidence not yet shown...?)</span>

Mr. Wright. I will say this one more time. I do not feel this trial needs to continue at all. ... However, I am giving you one chance... and only one.

<p>Judge:<br/>
This... is a wine glass, is it not?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Please look at the photo of the crime scene one more time! The scene is a mess because of the victim's struggle against his assailant. The vase was broken, his makeup is all over the floor... These were all things that were at one point, sitting on top of the dresser.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... Well, yes, I see your point.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
However! This glass, that is sitting on top of the dresser, is mysteriously untouched. The only thing that had not fallen over along with everything else is this wine glass! This piece of evidence is more than strange enough to warrant further consideration!

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Y-Yes, isn't it!? I thought it was!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You can stop looking at me with those puppy dog eyes of yours now. Mr. Edgeworth?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
What is it, Your Honor?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Your opinion...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...You don't need my opinion. Because there is no special meaning to that glass.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...What!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It's safe to say that the glass was set there after the crime took place. By the person who discovered the body, Adrian Andrews, for example. She could have easily been so shocked that she set the glass down without thinking.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... That does sound very plausible. Mr. Wright?

The defense would like to challenge the prosecution's theory. We would like to see something that proves it was Ms. Andrews who set the cup on the table!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... You've turned the situation on its head yet again, as usual. Mr. Edgeworth. Do you have any proof to back up your claim?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(There's no way he has any. He's just bluffing!)</span>

Unlike Mr. Wright, I never say anything unless I have the evidence to support it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh-What!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
You're not thinking hard enough today, Wright. Did you think this wine glass escaped my notice?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Th-Then...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Of course it has been thoroughly inspected... for fingerprints.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Fingerprints...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
There were only one set of fingerprints left on this wine glass.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Only one? Well, whose were they!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
They were not the victim's nor the defendant's. Rather, they were of one Adrian Andrews.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
WHAT!?
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Wine Glass updated in the Court Record.</span>

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Grrr! I can't believe I fell into another trap!)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Ms. Andrews was probably holding the glass when she went to see Mr. Corrida. But upon seeing his dead body, she was stunned, and set the glass down on the dresser.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... What you just said makes a lot of sense.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Tsk tsk tsk... Now do you see, Wright? You can't change any part of my scenario as it explains everything all too well.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Grrr!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I've thought long and hard this past year about what it means to be a "prosecutor". And from here on out, I will show you the answer I have come to discover!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
W-Wait a second... Mr. Edgeworth! I think the prosecution has provided enough evidence for me to enter my verdict...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Unfortunately, I can not allow you to pass judgment yet. The prosecution has yet another witness we would like the court to hear from.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
"Another witness"...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Yes. Bailiff! Please bring in the next witness!

No no no, please, by all means interrupt her! Please! *ahem* Anyway, witness, your testimony please.

It's true what they say, that youth are hotheaded nowadays. Not that I mind at all, Edgey. Now then, what should I start with...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The witness was on security detail at the hotel on the night of the murder. Is this correct, Ms. Oldbag?
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
It was a great job being able to see my dearie Juan! It was almost too much for my little heart to handle!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You mean... You were a fan of the victim?
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
Look, everyone is crazy over that Engarde, saying he's cute in a fresh way, or something. But not me! I wouldn't say anything so silly. After all, I have no interest in a little child like him. I'm only interested in a real man: Juan Corrida!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Um... But those two were the same age...)</span>
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
Anyway, as I was saying, I was pacing in front of his room that night.

The lobby. I was supposed to help set up the stage for that trifling show. But I refused to help, I'll have you know. It was for that Lead-headed Samurai's show. Heh, I even took out a few of the nails.

Your Honor. Do you know why this piece of evidence is important to this case?

If Mr. Engarde was really in the Nickel Samurai costume at the time of the murder, then it's impossible for his fingerprints to have been left on this knife! Actually, he would have wiped all previous fingerprints on this knife right off!

And why would he do something like that? To leave his prints on the murder weapon? There is no way he would do something like that!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
However, there is one possibility!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Then let's hear your "possibility"!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It's very simple. The defendant went to the victim's room while in costume as the Nickel Samurai. At that time, the defendant held no intent to murder. He was probably just going to relax and talk with the victim about the stage show. Which is why he took his gloves off!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>

This is Adrian Andrews, Mr. Engarde's manager.

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>

W-Witness...? What in the world are you...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Watch out, Phoenix. I've got a bad feeling about this... A very bad feeling.
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
I got some information... Some very secret information from a certain source. So that's why I was doing my own little investigation... In secret, of course.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
B-But what for...?
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
Oh, just for myself... Personal reasons and all that.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
... Well, Mr. Edgeworth. How will you proceed from here?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I really don't want to do this, however I cannot simply let this point slide.

That Engarde is one evil, evil man!<br/>
He thought he could ruin poor Juan by causing a huge scandal!<br/>
So to do that, he sent his own manager to get in close with Juan!<br/>

</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Edgeworth. What about this Adrian Andrews person...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
We have looked into this matter, and found that the "truth" the article proposes is, in fact, baseless gossip.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... But should this be true... Then this proves that the defendant did bear <span style="color:#E16935">ill-will</span> towards the victim.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...So this means I have to smash this rumor once and for all.)</span>

Now then, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.

Ms. Oldbag! That note was with a camera, inside its case, wasn't it?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
A camera...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yesterday, Lotta Hart was raising a huge stink over her camera. She kept saying something like, "My sweetie $1,600 camera disappeared on me!"
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Why... Why... Witness!!
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
What is it, gramps?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
If you have the note, then it is only logical that you have the camera too!
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
Grr... Looks like you found me out again, sonny... Is this the camera you're looking for?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Ah, that's...!
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
What!? Even though I look like this, I'm still a person, you know! I still eat meals like you, I fall in love... and "borrow" things from people!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Um... I think your definition of "borrow" is a little off...
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
I saw that woman's business card and that's when I noticed it said, "Slimebag Celebrity Photographer Extraordinaire"! Well, when I saw that, I had to know what sort of pictures she had taken! I'm a professional security guard! It's my business to know these things!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Bailiff! Check this camera's photos. Hurry! We must examine them at once!

<p>Judge:<br/>
Well, Mr. Edgeworth... What do we have?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
There is only one photo that seems to be relevant to this case.

Please present it to the court! Th-This is... This is the Nickel Samurai!
</p><p>Oldbag:<br/>
See, I told you! That's the guy I saw!

This proves that the witness was not lying earlier about this matter.

</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Wh-What does all this mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
This photo by itself does not prove that the person in it is the defendant. However! In his own confession, Mr. Engarde clearly stated that... At the time of the murder, he was <span style="color:#E16935">still in his Nickel Samurai costume</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
If that is the case, then... this Nickel Samurai is...

The defendant.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
How did it come to this...? I think this brings us to the end. We have examined every piece of evidence thoroughly. Final comments, Mr. Wright? The court will consider them before we close. Do you agree that this photo is decisive evidence against your client?

There is only one explanation for this! The person inside this costume is clearly much <span style="color:#E16935">shorter</span> than the defendant! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Alright. I think I've turned things around for myself this time!)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br/>

Edgeworth is unusually calm today...

That's true...

He's just letting the trial run itself -- as if he's only along for the ride.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
"Along for the ride"...? What do you mean by that?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
I can only think that perhaps he <span style="color:#E16935">doesn't feel under attack</span> at all...

Mr. Edgeworth! Where does this leave us!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
If the person in this photo is not Matt Engarde... Then everything the prosecution has tried to prove has become meaningless!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
... Hmm... I thought it would come to this.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
WHAT!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Wright. I have something I want to ask you. I think you have proven that the person inside this costume is not Matt Engarde. In that case... Who IS this a photo of...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Who is the person wearing the Nickel Samurai costume?)</span>
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Don't stress out over this, Phoenix. It's very simple. What you should be focused on is Edgeworth's attitude, don't you think?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>

For starters, she's short. And, she can freely move in and out of Mr. Engarde's room. Finally, she had dinner with Mr. Engarde that night.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
And how does that all add up?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
It means that it makes it very easy for her to get a certain item. ...A certain knife with Mr. Engarde's fingerprints all over it!

The knife that was used as a murder weapon!

Hmm... Because she was the one that came to wake me up? ... Then... Dude, you're saying it really was her...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes. She is the <span style="color:#E16935">real killer</span>... She was the one who murdered Juan Corrida.

Phoenix... You think her motive is related to Celeste Inpax's <span style="color:#E16935">missing suicide note</span>, right?

...Yes. <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from [Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and will to live.] in the original release">Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and reason to live.</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [Ms. Andrews depended on Ms. Inpax for her strength and will to live.] in the original release)</span> But then Ms. Inpax suddenly killed herself.

I am the manager of the defendant in this case, Mr. Matt Engarde.

I see. Now then...
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Before we begin, Your Honor, I have one request.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Uh, yes, sure. What is it?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
I'm sure everyone in this room is wondering the same thing, and would love to find out more about my relationship with the victim. After all, it was the topic of a certain weekly "magazine" recently...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Ah, no, I have no idea what you mean. I've never even heard of "Gossip Land"...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(If the judge was ever a prosecution witness, he'd do all my work for me...)</span>
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Anyway, I was wondering if you could please tell us about your relation to the victim.
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Yes, I was seeing Mr. Corrida. I was also aware of the rivalry that existed between Matt and Juan... But this was a private matter between Juan and myself.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm, so it was a "fry 'n bait" matter... or was that "bait 'n fry"? Reminds me of fishing...
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
But I... But I didn't kill him.

It was time for the show to start, so I went to get Matt from his room.<br/>
After that, I went to Juan's room.<br/>
And there was his dead body. I... I was in shock...<br/>
What I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo.<br/>
I felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
You poured yourself a glass of juice...?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Yes. Sadly, I didn't remember not to touch things at the scene of a crime... And I disturbed the crime scene by moving this one thing...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
And that is when the fingerprints on the wine glass were made, Your Honor.

Phoenix. She is one cool and collected customer, and she has the brains to match.

It's not "some" problem, it's a "major" problem. It's true that the top of the guitar case was wet with water. However, that's exactly what is so strange! Ms. Andrews! You testified that the vase fell onto the guitar case! However! If that was true, the case should have gotten wet on the <span style="color:#E16935">inside</span>, not the outside!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Th-That's very true!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Furthermore, there is one other strange thing about this guitar case.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
And wh-what is that?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Let's take another look at the crime scene photo. The remains of the vase are scattered on the floor.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
And what is wrong with that?

If the guitar case was open when the vase fell... The glass shards should be INSIDE, not outside the case!

No. Think back to what Ms. Andrews testified to! She said that other than the vase, she didn't touch anything else!

It's elementary, my dear. Because the only <span style="color:#E16935">fingerprints</span> on this guitar case are those of the <span style="color:#E16935">victim</span>!

Ah!

... You shouldn't assume that I must have left prints just because I touched the case.

What if I were to tell you that I was wearing gloves at the time?

Gloves...? But why would you be wearing gloves at the time?

It was the night of the award ceremony. So of course I dressed up for the occasion. Yes, now I remember... I'm almost sure I was wearing a pair of thin gloves.

W-Wait one second, Your Honor! The Nickel Samurai's costume would have been Mr. Matt Engarde's! Why would something of the defendant's be in the victim's room!? And inside the guitar case, of all places!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm, true... That is a little baffling... Mr. Wright, the court would like to hear your thoughts. What was this Nickel Samurai costume doing inside the guitar case...?

<p>Judge:<br/>
What is this...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
On the night of the murder, after the stage show, the Nickel Samurai was going to hold a special <span style="color:#E16935">press conference</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
A press conference...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes, the Nickel Samurai was supposed to <span style="color:#E16935">confess</span> something at this conference.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I heard about this as well. For once, you're not making something up, Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But what struck me as strange was that Mr. Engarde himself said he had <span style="color:#E16935">no idea</span> he was supposed to be holding a press conference that night.
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
But how can that be!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The way I see it, that can mean only one thing: The conference was set up by none other than the victim, <span style="color:#E16935">Mr. Juan Corrida</span> himself!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Th-The victim?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Yes. The spare Nickel Samurai costume was prepared for that very conference! Mr. Corrida was going to hold the press conference as the "<span style="color:#E16935">Nickel Samurai</span>"!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
He was going to dress up as the Nickel Samurai and hold a conference!? But why would the victim do such a thing!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That's something I don't quite know yet, however... What I am concerned with right now is <span style="color:#E16935">what he intended to reveal</span> at that conference.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
The Nickel Samurai was going to "<span style="color:#E16935">confess</span>" something. And by "confess", I'd wager he was going to reveal something about "<span style="color:#E16935">himself</span>".
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Which means that Juan Corrida, posing as the Nickel Samurai, was going to speak about <span style="color:#E16935">Matt Engarde</span>!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Yes, I guess that is what it would mean...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
But, if that's the case... that's not a "confession"! That's "<span style="color:#E16935">public disclosure</span>"!
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Hmph.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
M-Ms. Andrews...?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
I can see why you are pros at what you do.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Pardon me?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Yes, just as you say, the press conference was set up by Juan.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Ms. Andrews! Please offer us an explanation for this!
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
I was the one he asked to help set it up. And the person who prepared the second costume for him... That was also me.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You...!?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Juan had bet everything on the Jammin' Ninja this year. And if he lost the Grand Prix... He was going to make sure Matt was <span style="color:#E16935">going down with him</span>. That's what he thought anyway.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
He was going to ruin him, huh...?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
It looked like somehow, Juan had in his hands a <span style="color:#E16935">secret so powerful</span>... that it would <span style="color:#E16935">destroy Matt's acting career</span> had it been revealed!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
And do you know what this "secret" of Mr. Engarde's is, Ms. Andrews...?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
... That's something only Juan knew. I... I don't know what it is.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Ah... I see.
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
I... I've probably been coming off quite suspicious to everyone, but that's to be expected. I've been trying to protect Matt, after all...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
P-Protect Mr. Engarde!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
And yet again another strange bit of truth comes to light it seems... Ms. Andrews, if you could, please tell us the truth about your behavior!
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Yes, Your Honor. I understand.

</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
If you want to prove that someone did something, you need three things.

Three... things?

A motive, an opportunity to commit the crime, and finally... decisive evidence. And if you think these three things through, the answer becomes quite clear.

Yes. Do you know why Juan chose that event and that hotel for the conference? Because that was when he could cause the most damage to the public's beloved Matt Engarde.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
And you knew of this plan, didn't you, Ms. Andrews?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Yes... because I was the one who set up the conference and prepared the costume.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But... I'm sure Mr. Engarde himself didn't know anything about a press conference.

You can hardly call the knife "decisive evidence"! The fingerprints on the knife could very well be a clever camouflage!
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Then... What about the button?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The button...?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
It's clear from the crime scene that the victim and the murderer fought. And during the fight, the killer ripped the button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
You're talking about this button, correct?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
That button was found in the pleats of Matt's hakama, isn't that correct? I would think that makes it very decisive evidence.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Urk.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Looks like you were out-foxed again, Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
A-Anyway! The knife doesn't prove a thing! Please fix your testimony!
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
I can't stand the sight of a man who can't gracefully accept his defeat.

This witness could have disclosed things about Mr. Engarde at any time. Why, then, would she wait until there was a large audience before doing so?

<p>Phoenix:<br/>
This is the victim's autopsy report. It clearly states that the cause of death was "<span style="color:#E16935">strangulation by a scarf</span>".
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
S...Strangulation...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The knife stab to the victim was done <span style="color:#E16935">after</span> the victim had already died.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
A-And what does that mean?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Let's examine the evidence. This button has the victim's blood on it. Which would mean that it was ripped off of the costume... when?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
<span style="color:#E16935">After</span> the knife was stabbed into the victim...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Exactly! Which means... It is impossible that this button was torn off during the victim's final struggle, because the victim was <span style="color:#E16935">strangled to death</span> in that fight!
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Ah...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That's right, Ms. Andrews. There is no way this button was ripped off during the struggle. This button was consciously pulled off of the victim's already dead body!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! Wh-What is the meaning--

What is the meaning of this, Wright!? So what if the button was torn off the body after the victim had already died? What does that change!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Let me ask you one simple question, Mr. Edgeworth. Why was the button torn off? What purpose did that serve?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
What "purpose"...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
We now know this button was not torn off during the fight. So the murderer took the time and effort to purposely rip this from the victim's body. That would mean that the murderer <span style="color:#E16935">had something in mind</span>, wouldn't it?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Wright! Does this mean... Does this mean you know what the murderer wanted to do with this button!? What was it!?

<p>Phoenix:<br/>
Ms. Adrian Andrews! I choose you! You are Mr. Corrida's killer!
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Wh-What!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Order! Order! Order!! Mr. Wright! This is a very grave matter! Do you have any evidence that supports your charge...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
"Any evidence"...? ALL of the evidence points to Ms. Andrews!
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Wh... How preposterous! You can't stick any of that on me!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
I can't, can I? Would you care to test me?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Then... Then what about this knife!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The knife was used to stab the victim after he had already been strangled to death. It was used to throw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, naturally. A knife covered in the defendant's fingerprints could only be taken from <span style="color:#E16935">his room</span>. And the only one who had dinner with him, and knew which knife to take, was you.
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
...Tsk! Th-Then! What... What about the button that was found in Matt's hakama!?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
This button was removed from the victim's body <span style="color:#E16935">after</span> he had already died. The only people who could've done so were the <span style="color:#E16935">person who found his body</span> or the <span style="color:#E16935">killer</span>. However, if Mr. Engarde was the real killer, there is no way he would have put such incriminating evidence in his own hakama!
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Ughn...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
The only person who could have put this button into Mr. Engarde's hakama, is the person who went to wake him from his nap... which is you, yet again, Ms. Andrews.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I... I see... What about the empty guitar case...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That is also another piece of evidence that incriminates Ms. Andrews. That costume was used to hide the real killer's identity as they fled the crime scene. Now, who could have known that there was just such a costume inside the guitar case...? It could only have been the person who prepared the costume for the victim. And that person is... you, Ms. Adrian Andrews!
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
N...No... I...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>

</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
But Ms. Andrews' fingerprints were nowhere to be found on the guitar case! And it was you who proved that she was not wearing gloves at the time!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
...! Th-That's right!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
That's because she did not intend on leaving any prints. If anyone had found out that she had touched the case, they would have asked her why. So to avoid leaving any prints, she used a towel or something else to open it. But! The glass of tomato juice is a different story! Ms. Andrews purposefully left her fingerprints on the glass to show that yes, indeed, she was the classic "dazed discoverer" of a dead body!
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Aaaaaah!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
And to top it all off, there is this photo! A photo of the killer as they exited the scene of the crime. No reasonable person on Earth can believe this Nickel Samurai is Mr. Engarde! He would be much too short for his own costume if it was him.
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Speaking of how tall people are... Ms. Andrews, you're also kind of short in stature, are you not?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
P-Please... Stop...

Well, how about it, Ms. Andrews!?

Ms. Andrews...?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
... I... I... I refuse... to testify.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
What was that...?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Th-There's a law... It says I can't be forced to testify about something... if it can incriminate me!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Well, yes... You are absolutely correct, Ms. Andrews. The law does provide us with a way to avoid <span style="color:#E16935">self-incrimination</span>... by allowing a witness to not testify if the testimony can cause damage to themselves.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
WHAT!? <span style="color:#0070C0">("<span style="color:#E16935">Pleading the fifth</span>" is not something most people would think to do on the spot! Actually... Thinking back to yesterday in Mr. Engarde's room...)</span>

You did a good job proving everything up to this point, Phoenix. But there is still one thing you haven't done.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Something I haven't done...?

Heh heh heh. What's wrong, Wright? Are you finished already? Run out of evidence?

</p><p>Judge:<br/>
What is so humorous, Mr. Edgeworth!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I'm sure you realize this as well, Your Honor... But, everything the good lawyer here has proven up to this point is meaningless.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Wh-What!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Everything you have proven is circumstantial.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#E16935">Circumstantial</span>...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Yes, circumstantial. You have yet to provide a single piece of <span style="color:#E16935">definitive proof</span>. Proof that Ms. Andrews, did in fact, harbor a wish to murder Mr. Corrida!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
M-Ms. Andrews! You... Did you want to kill Mr. Corrida...?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
I believe this may lead to me incriminating myself, so I will abstain from answering.

But Ms. Andrews... If you do that, it would be the same as admitting your guilt, don't you think...?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Maybe so, or maybe not. There is nothing to prove it either way. Besides, you don't even know what crime I would be "guilty" of due to my silence.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(NO!! She's taking that defiant attitude again!)</span> M-Mia! What should we do...?
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Somehow, we've landed in the worst possible situation.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I think we have reached a certain conclusion at this point in time. Ms. Adrian Andrews has refused to testify. And the defense's theory that she is the actual murderer... has not been fully substantiated with <span style="color:#E16935">solid, definitive proof</span>.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
But! That's not true!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
In this situation, there is only one thing this court can do. And that is to declare a recess.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
R-Recess...!?
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
I request that both the prosecution and the defense look further into this matter. And at tomorrow's trial...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(<span style="color:#E16935">T-Tomorrow</span>...!? We don't have a "tomorrow"! If we don't get a not guilty verdict today, then...)</span>

It is not impossible for this trial to continue.
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
...!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Mr. Edgeworth! Wh-What are you...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It's true Ms. Andrews holds the right against self-incrimination; however, if the topic of conversation were something unrelated to whatever she may be guilty of, then she has no right to withhold testimony!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Y-Yes, that is very true, but...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Actually, there is one little thing that I'm curious about. Ms. Andrews.
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
When you found the victim's dead body, you poured yourself a glass of juice.
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Y-Yes... And...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I can't help but think how unnatural that is. Usually when one finds a body, they are shaken up, not stirring a glass of juice.
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
So my actions were "unusual"? But I've already...
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Before you speak, I want to state that if you have a reason behind your actions, I would like you to testify to that effect.
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Testify...!?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Your Honor! I would like to request that the witness testify again as to what happened when she first discovered the victim's body! Whatever we find out in this testimony should in no way implicate the witness.
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
I don't know what it is about Edgeworth today, but I can't get a good read off of him. Is he friend or foe? I just don't know...
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
The court acknowledges the prosecution's request. Ms. Andrews, if you please.

<p>Andrews:<br/>
That glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself.<br/>
I was surprised when I walked into the room and saw it in that messy state.<br/>
And Juan... He was sitting slumped over and tired-looking in the corner.<br/>
When I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind.<br/>
To be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice.<br/>
When I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
Hmm... So you poured that glass of juice for the victim. Why didn't you say so in your earlier testimony?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
...I didn't think I needed to include something so trivial.
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Phoenix. Please be careful here. If you can't find anything wrong with this testimony, then there's nothing left...

The "absolute, real truth"...? What are you...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
Witness... Don't you understand yet?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
...Huh?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
I don't know who planted this silly idea in your head, but as long as you "protect" yourself through your silence, Matt Engarde will go free. And in his place... YOU will become the <span style="color:#E16935">guilty party</span>!
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
...Th-That's... That's a lie! I... I don't believe you!
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
What...?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
I... I was told... If I spoke... If I spoke, then it would be all over... And Matt would never be declared guilty...

Don't you rememeber, Phoenix? Ms. Andrews lives by gripping tightly onto the words of another. Because she doesn't have the strength to believe in herself.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Th...Then, right now... Ms. Andrews is...
</p><p>Mia:<br/>
Yesterday, she was tossed a life-saver by <span style="color:#E16935">Ms. von Karma</span>. "Don't say a word, no matter what happens. If you do, Matt Engarde will be acquitted." Ms. Andrews undyingly believes in those words right now, and is clinging onto them...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Th-Then what should we do!? This... This is the first time I've ever come across anything like this! But Ms. Andrews has to be the killer, right!? All we have to do now is... is get our not guilty... That is my only priority!)</span>

It wasn't me! I'm begging you, please believe me! I didn't kill Juan! Help... Please... Someone... Help me...!

</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Who's the real mastermind? Isn't that obvious!? There's no one else it could be except the woman crying over there! ...Right?)</span>

When I first saw him... I really thought he had fainted. Honest.<br/>
When I realized he was dead... That was when I formulated my plan.<br/>
Once I made sure there was no one in the hallway, I made a dash back to Matt's room.<br/>
And then... I stabbed Juan's dead body with the knife, and ripped off the button.<br/>
Just when I finished and was returning to Matt's room... I had a bit of an inconvenience.<br/>
And that's why... That's why I ended up using the Nickel Samurai costume.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Judge:<br/>
S-Stabbed the body!? With the knife!? But why would you do that!?
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>
Isn't it obvious? To pin the blame on a certain person... A certain cowardly man!
</p><p>Judge:<br/>
Wh... What do you mean by all of this...?
</p><p>Edgeworth:<br/>
It might take this court a little while to understand, but... This is the truth.
</p><p>Andrews:<br/>

So, Ms. Andrews stabbed the victim, Juan Corrida, in the chest with the knife. However, she didn't do it with murder in mind. She did it with the intent of framing Matt Engarde for the murder... And this! This is her "crime"!

He... had a scarf tied around his neck... But that scarf is a part of the Jammin' Ninja's costume... So... So I didn't think anything about it was strange...

That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Matt Engarde...

The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!
