What is it?

I've got a confession to make... I'm terrible at figuring out magic tricks...

Magic tricks?

Yep.

That's because the tricks are performed by pros. They do it so you can't guess the trick.
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
But but... The trick Pearly showed me was incredible!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Pearls did a magic trick? Hmm... What kind of trick was it?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Let's see. It looked like she pulled the end of her own thumb off!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Heh...
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
First she put her right thumb next to her left hand, and then it just separated! She could move it up and down and everything! It was incredible!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Really? Was it kinda like this...?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
WHAT!? WOW! HOW'D YOU DO THAT!? Nick, you're like a real magician! See this is why I just can't figure out magic... I'm no good at it... Especially hard tricks like flying away from the scene of a murder...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
You'll take all the fun out of magic if you keep trying to figure it out.

You must not have heard me... I am really sick of telling this story. But what can you do? I'm Maximillion Galactica. I suppose I can tell it again. ... Voila! Here, take a look at this! I just happen to have a picture from the Grand Prix with me. Just look at that fabulous stage!! That is the first stage that I ever flew on. I flew right over the audience!

Alright! You know what time it is!! Riddle time!! Why does everyone cry when they eat Mexican pizza?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
Umm...
</p><p>Moe:<br/>
C'mon! You can answer this! It's easy!!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br/>
...Because cafeteria Mexican pizza is possibly a weapon of bowel destruction?
</p><p>Moe:<br/>
*BUZZ* Wrong! Try again! OK! What do you think, girlie?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Umm... Ahh! I got it!!
</p><p>Moe:<br/>
OK!! What is your answer?
</p><p>Maya:<br/>
Because they are in the Café Teary Eye!
</p><p>Moe:<br/>
Exactly!! It's an incredibly sad place, that café. Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!
