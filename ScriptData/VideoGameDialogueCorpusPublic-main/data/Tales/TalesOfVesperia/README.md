# Tales of Vesperia

This is an extra game included for a Masters' project. It is not included in the analysis of gender biases in video game dialogue.

## Gender Coding

The generics tend to be male characters (e.g. imperial knights etc.)

Cotton and Healas can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei6p_Xskk2c

Dark Lord, Minion, Princess, Heroine: these are characters the main PCs are acting as in a play. It is very obvious which PC is playing which character, so I have renamed them according to their character name (e.g. so Dark Lord's lines are attributed to Yuri). However, this could be handled differently for different purposes. The play can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGi6dcaH0qM. The narrator is played by Judith. 

Barrelow X chooses the name Karolow X, so I have put in an alias accordingly. 

"Raven" and "Schwann" are the same person (spoilers!), so I have added an alias accordingly. https://aselia.fandom.com/wiki/Raven

"Male Resident (Lower Quarter)" - can be seen repeatedly talking here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d97uTjuMrrs

Knights 1 and 2 (Zaphias) have a conversation here: https://lparchive.org/Tales-of-Vesperia/Update%2002/. They are generic knight NPCs, coded male in accordance with the other voiced NPCs of this type. The aforementioned is a useful resource for many of the characters, with links to videos of the game cutscenes. 

Best I can tell, "Patrolling Knight" is a generic type - you encounter a battle whenever you encounter one in the castle. 

"Child (Lower Quarter)" can be heard here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m66NN1_DT24 - coded neutral as couldn't decisively tell gender. 

Kid 1 - Kid 3 in Halure seem to have male voice actors and male sprites - see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBQfw6aSTws. 

"Estellise" is better known as "Estelle" (and she requests people call her that as the game progresses) so I have used that alias. 

I think this line - "I told you what would happen to that little brat if you didn't have our money!" - is spoken by the NPC I've called "Mercenary (Capua Nor)" (because Karol later identifies him as a mercenary), but it is uttered off-screen, so it may be the accountant(?) accompanying him (both male, similar voices). (For reference, he's called an accountant here: https://tales.neoseeker.com/wiki/Capua_Nor). Both of them are henchmen for the imperial magistrate in Capua Nor. Further evidence is that an identical NPC also uses "brat" in this way in a subsequent scene (the guard with no helmet by the mansion). Given that this isn't the standard guard NPC for the area (who wears a helmet), I've coded these two as the same character (since it seems plausible that they are.)

The Mantaic Innkeeper is coded male based on their voice (https://youtu.be/Riqr5hOeGhI?t=1019) and pronouns used in-game. 

Kowz is a small child wearing a cow costume, with udders, who gives you cow milk among other items. The fan base seems to read Kowz as male (see for instance https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/945075-tales-of-vesperia/46867761, https://www.reddit.com/r/tales/comments/rh4kfz/tales_of_vesperia_kowz/,). I have coded male accordingly; this could be revisited. Note that various Nam Cobanda characters share the Kowz character model, and some of them are referred to with male pronouns by the characters. Given their identical visual appearance, I've coded all as male. 

Desert Merchant can be heard here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47p-PlMMA2s. 

The precise allocation of lines to the various Flirty Friends for unknownchar2746-2755 might be slightly off - it's based on https://lparchive.org/Tales-of-Vesperia/Update%2089/. 

The Union Outpost person in Dahngrest Tavern is also the male barkeeper (thus why some of the lines - e.g. the fish filleting knife subquest) may seem a bit strange to be allocated to him. 

Belius becomes Undine, and takes on the new name when they have changed form. They are thus coded as different characters; however, this could be revisited for different purposes. The change occurs at unnamedchar926. 

I cannot identify who utters lines 1092-1095. They take place in the Capua Torim Inn, as best as I can tell (this scene occurs after Nobis has been left injured there, and he subsequently appears elsewhere). I can't find the scene in any videos or in the let's play archive. It may be the doctor who later appears in Aurnion, but I can't be sure. Attributed to "Unknown (Capua Torim Inn)".

The conversation with the "Unknown Aspio Mage" seems to have an alternative version (listed directly above it in the data). The "Unknown (Collector's Book)" appears to be an alternate scene for if you miss getting the collector's book the first time in Aspio.
