&gt; It's a transcript of this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpBShSvEkmc&amp;t=2530s
&gt;  which is the Special Edition. The voiced dialogue sometimes
&gt;  deviates from the written text, but the transcription below is
&gt;  the written text (which is the same as in the original).
&gt; The video plays through only the actions required to reach the ending.
&gt; It's not a speedrun, but it does skip a lot of lore, backstory and chatting.
&gt; There is also a lot less repetition than there would be in a &quot;blind&quot;
playthrough.
&gt; There is a lot more dialogue in the game than represented here.
&gt; Only dialogue between characters is transcribed, and none of Guybrush's
options are listed.
&gt; Guybrush describes objects and voices his thoughts for player, but these lines
are not transcribed.


LOCATION: Cavern under the ground.

Elaine: Well, well, well. Gubrush Threepwood. You do turn up in the strangest
places.

Guybrush: Err... Hi Elaine. Do you think you could help me out?

Elaine: How did you get into this mess?

Guybrush: It's kind of a long story.

Elaine: That's OK, I've got time.

Guybrush: *sigh* Well, it all started on Scabb Isalnd. Some of my admiring fans
had pressured me into telling my LeChuck evaporating story once again ...

LOCATION: Deep in the Caribbean: Scabb Island

Guybrush:So I bust into the church and say, &quot;Now you're in for it, you bilious
bag of barnacle bait!&quot; .. and then LeChuck cries, &quot;Guybrush! Have mercy!, I
can't take it anymore!&quot;

Fink: I think I know how he must have felt.

Bart: Yeah, if I hear this story one more time, I'm gonna be crying myself.

Fink: Don't you have any NEW stories?

Guybrush: Well, actually, that's why I'm here on Scabb Island. I'm on a whole
new adveture.

Fink: Growing a moustache?

Guybrush: No. Bigger than that.

Fink: A beard?

Guybrush: No, I'm in search of treasure. The biggest treasure of them all. A
treasure so valuable and so well hidden, that it haunts the dreams of every
pirate on the seas.

Fink: You mean ...

Fink: Big Whoop?

Bart: Big Whoop?

Guybrush: None other.

Bart: Then, why'd you come here? There's no treasure on Scabb Island!

Guybrush: Well, I didn't know that before. Now I'm trying to charter a ship and
look someplace else. When I return, I'll have riches galore, and a whole new
story.

Bart: Or you'll have a died trying.

Fink: Either way, we won't have to hear about LeChuck anymore.

Guybrush: how's the pirate biz?

Bart: Horrible

Fink: The sailing embargo has all of us pirates land lock we can't go about our
business.

Bart: Some of us tried pirating on land but it just didn't feel right

Guybrush: What's this about an embargo?

Fink: The Largo embargo.

Bart: Well it's no really an embargo it's a tax on ships coming or going.

Fink: But it's a huge tax that no captain on this island can afford

Bart: Including Dread 

Fink: That fool Largo doesn't know when to stop. He can't take more from us than
we have.

Guybrush: Any idea where I could hire a ship?

Fink: you'll need to go to the far side of the island and there you'll meet a
man named captain Dread.

Guybrush: Yikes. Sounds intimidating.

Bart: Not really ... once you get to know him.

Fink: Of course, he can't take you anywhere until Largo lifts his sailing
embargo.

Guybrush: Do you guys know any piraty songs?

Bart: Sure, Fink here knows a million go ahead Fink sing that one about Scabb
Island. 

Fink: Oh all right. Well I'd rather be a pirate on Scabb ... than a Scabb on a
pirate and if you'll listen to me gab I'll tell you why I admire it. Oh the
people aren't too friendly. The weather's not the best.  The lodging's too
expensive and Largos a quite pest. But the thing I like about Scabb is what it
hasn't got. No mayor or police force and no jail in which to rot.

Bart: That was beautiful. 

Guybrush: Any marshmallows left?

Bart: Marshmallows? We don't have any marshmallows.

Guybrush: What's that white fluffy thing on the end of your stick?

Fink: It's the stuffing or under my eyepatch. 

Bart: We're just sterilizing it.

Fink: We're pirates, Guybrush, not Girl Scouts.

Guybrush: Well I 'll see you salty dogs later.

Bart: That reminds me, do we have any weenies left?


LOCATION: Woodtick bridge

Guybrush: Oops, excuse me.

Largo: Outta my way, fancy-pants!

Largo: On second thought, stop right there! You ain't from these parts, are ye?
This is a tool bridge. You gotta pay.

Guybrush: Is this some sort of bribe situation?

Largo: No more like extortion. Here -- allow me to demonstrate.

[G is shaken for money]

Guybrush: Help! Police!

Largo: Scream as loud as you want, there's no police on Scabb Island.

Guybrush: Then who eats the donuts and roughs up the transients.

Largo: I roughs-up what needs roughing-up on this island. Hey! Yer Loaded! THis
is my lucky night! Remember ... wherever you go , on sea or on land, you can't
ever hide from Largo LaGrande!

Guybrush: Tough town, I guess I should have got those traveller's cheques.

LOCATION: Cartographer's

Wally: Hello. 

Guybrush: Excuse me.

Wally: Oh yes. Hi there. Can I help you?

Guybrush: Hi. I'm Guybrush. Who are you?

Wally: Wally. Wally B. Feed. At your service. 

Guybrush: I have some questions about Scabb Island.

Wally: Why? Thinking about moving here?

Guybrush: Actually, I'm trying to get off it as soon as possible.

Wally: Good luck! With the sailing embargo Largo's imposed on Scabb, it's hard
to get anywhere. Which doesn't help my business, let me tell you.

Guybrush: Thank's that's all I needed to know.

Wally: Okay. But don't be shy if you think of a question.

Guybrush: Do you know anything about Big Whoop?

Wally: Uh oh, who sent you? I should warn you: I'm heavily armed.

Guybrush: Nobody sent me. I'm free-lance.

Wally: You better not try for my files. All of my research on Big Whoop is in
there. 

Guybrush: Are you looking for Big Whoop, too?

Wally: Well... I haven't really been able to find out much hard information...
What do YOU know about it?  

Guybrush: I know I'm looking for it, and that's about it.

Wally: You mean, you never heard of the four men who buried it?

Guybrush: No. Tell me all about it.

Wally: Well, all anyone knows for sure is that there was a shipwreck. the
merchant vessel Elaine went down in a terrible storm. 

Guybrush: Elaine?

Wally: Only four crew members survived. They washed up on a remote, deserted
island. Some say it's name was &quot;Inky Island&quot;, but I don't believe that.

Guybrush: Why don't you believe it?

Wally: Because there's no such island. Anyway, that's where they supposedly
found Big Whoop.

Guybrush: But what IS Big Whoop?

Wally: Whatever it was, it was so wonderful ... or so horrible ... that they
never wanted anyone else to find it. So they took the map they made of the
island ... and split it up among the four of them. And they all went their
separate ways. 

Guybrush: Wow. That's some story.

Wally: Of course, it could just be an old legend. But if I could just see the
map of that island ... I bet I could recognize the shape of the land and track
it down myself.

Guybrush: Thanks. I gotta go.

Wally: Okeydokey.

LOCATION: Woodtick Bar

Guybrush: Excuse me...

Barkeep: Yeah, boy?

Guybrush: How's business?

Barkeep: It's just terrible ... No one ever comes down here anymore. Largo's got
all my regulars spooked. You know, I can mix any drink there is ... make
anything you could name .. bui I can't make the one thing that could really do
this island some good. 

Guybrush: What's that?

Barkeep: A voodoo doll of Largo LaGrande!

Largo: You there!

Barkeep: Uh oh!

Largo: Give me my usual. And put it in a real glass!

[Barkeep serves him a drink and Largo spits the drink out]

Largo: Fork over the dough, or you'll be serving Bloody Marys for a week. From
your nose.

Barkeep: That's all I have.

Largo: Well, you'd better have more tomorrow ... or we might have to move this
dump to a new location. Like, say, the bottom of the ocean? Ha ha ha.

Guybrush: Boy, you just gave him all your money?

Barkeep: I don't want to talk about it.

LOCATION: Woodtick Inn

Innkeeper: Hey! How'd old Pegbiter get loose? I'd better go catch him ... before
he catches somebody else.


LOCATION: Laundry

Sleeping pirate1: Hey, leave that alone.

Guybrush: Sorry, is this your bucket?

Sleeping pirate1: Well ... No. 

Guybrush: So, you won't mind if I take it?

Sleeping pirate1: I guess not.


LOCATION: Peninsula, Houseboat.

Guybrush: Hello?

Captain Dread: Hello mon. My name's Captain Dread. What can I do for ya?

Guybrush: Natty dreads.

Captain Dread: Thanks, mon.

Guybrush: I need to charter a ship.

Captain Dread: I can't charter you my ship because ... a while ago, I lost my
lucky sailing necklace. I called it 'my eye that has seen the world'. I can't
sail without it. No way, mon. Besides ... That mean and nasty guy, Largo ... he
has an embargo on the island. No ships can sail in or out without his approval.
There's no way he'd let me leave.

Guybrush: Tell me more about the necklace thingy you lost.

Captain Dread: It happened sometime ago. My navigator and I set sail for this
legendary island. When we arrived, we were taken prisoner by cannibals. I
escaped, mon, but my navigator was not so lucky. All I found of him was one of
his eyeballs, and I've kept it as a good luck charm.

Guybrush: Gee, I think I've met your friend.

Captain Dread: Unlikely.

Guybrush: I gotta run, lots of treasure hunt'n to do.

Captain Dread: OK, bye, mon. Come again.


LOCATION: International house of Mojo

Voodoo Lady: Hey! That's just a display model!

Voodoo Lady: Guybrush Threepwood. It's been a long time since you came here to
see me.

Guybrush: How's business?

Voodoo Lady: Very good. Many hexes this week. Saved many people from the evil
eye. Made many pieces of eight, altough Largo took most of them.

Guybrush: Tell me about this Largo guy.

Voodoo Lady: He's a weak little man who bullies this whole island around. Most
peoplea re afraid of him becasue he was once LeChuck's right hand man.

Guybrush: But LeChuck's history. I got rid of him myself. 

Voodoo Lady: True evil can never be destroyed completely. You will see.

Guybrush: Why don't you just put a curse on Largo?

Voodoo Lady: I've tried. My most powerful magic lies in voodoo dolls. But to
make an effective doll I need some items from Largo's person, and no one's brave
enough to go get them for me. 

Guybrush: What kind of ingredients do you need for the doll?

Voodoo Lady: Are you willing to help me make one?

Guybrush: Uh, maybe.

Voodoo Lady: TO make it work you need to bring me some personal artifacts of the
victim. One from each of the four basic voodoo groups: Something of the Thread
... Something of the head ... something of the body ... and something of the
dead.

Guybrush: Hey, that almost rhymes.

Voodoo Lady: For the Thread, I need a piece of Largo's clothing. And a lock of
hair will do for the Head. Bring me a sample of fluid from his Body, And from
his Dead relatives you must acquire some remnant of a corpse. Here -- take this
shopping list.

[Voodoo Lady gives G the shopping list]

LOCATION: CEMETARY

Largo: I'd swear on my grandfather's grave something weird is going on.

LOCATION: International house of Mojo

Voodoo Lady: Do you have any of those ingredients with you?

Guybrush: I have his toupee.

Voodoo Lady: Hmmmm ... Not quite a part of his head ... But maybe I can get some
scalp fragments from it. Have you brought me any other ingredients?

Guybrush: I have some of his spit.

Voodoo Lady: Excellent. You make keep the paper. Have you rbought me any other
ingredients?

Guybrush: I'll bring you more later.

Voodoo Lady: Good. Now, go!

LOCATION: Largo's room.

[Guybrush puts a bucket over the door]

Largo: Hey! What the HELL? What's going on? Whoever did this is gonna pay! I
can't get this thing off my head. When I get this thing off my head somebody's
gonna be real sorry.

LOCATION: Laundry

Largo: You're making me mad, Marty.

Marty: That's my name -- don't wear it out

Largo: Look. I want it free ... and I want it tonight.

Marty: Party tonight? Sure, I'll I'll come.

Largo: I'm talking about getting my laundry.

Marty: Don't worry about me. I've been dry for three years.

Largo: I said, &quot;I need it back tonight&quot;!

Marty: What? Yeah, w'll say out all night.

Largo: This is useless.

Largo: (to Guybrush) You tell him I'll be back to pick it up ... or else.

LOCATION: Bar

Guybrush: Excuse me ...

Barkeep: Yeah, boy?

Guybrush: Grog, please. Shaken, not stirred.

Barkeep: Ha ha ha! Maybe you'd like Shirley Temple instead?

Guybrush: I'm old enough! Look at my beard.

Barkeep: Ha! That's the oldest trick in the book! Tell you what -- I'll let you
have some near-grog. It doesn't have any alcohol in it ... but it's just as
nasty smelling and foul-tasing as that stuff grown-ups drink. 

Guybrush: Right on!

Barkeep: Oh wait. What am I saying? I just sold the last of it to Kate. Sorry.

Guybrush: Rats.

Barkeep: Of course, if you have some ID ...

Guybrush: Who's this Kate person you mentioned? 

Barkeep: Ah the Courageous Captain Kate Capsize. Tough as stell, sharp as nails.
She rents her ship out ... does some free-lance pirating. Her only loyalty is to
the highest bidder. Don't get on her bad side. 

Guybrush: Hey ... Ah ... How's the stew tonight?

Barkeep: Stew? How gauche! We only serve gourmet chilled supes here. In fact,
our new cook has been working all day on a very special vichyssoise. Let me go
see he's doing.

Barkeep: How's the vichyssoise, Bernard.

Bernard: Excellent, sir. Won't you have a taste?

Barkeep: I think I will ... OH MY GOD!!! What kind of demented recipe book are
you using?!?

Guybrush: Hee, hee, hee!

Barkeep: You're fired!

Bernard: But sir!

Barkeep: Out! Get out of my sight! This is the most disgusting filthy mess I've
ever seen in my life! Look at all the hair! And what's this stuff? How am I ever
going to get rid of this junk?

Barkeep: Well, here's your soup.

Guybrush: Uh. I'm really not that hungry anymore.

Barkeep: Dang. Hey, can you cook?

Guybrush: A little.

Barkeep: How'd you like a career in the fast-paced world of pub-food cuisine?

Guybrush: Are you saying there's an opening in the kitchen.

Barkeep: Yeah. You interested?

Guybrush: I dunno. How much does it pay?

Barkeep: 420 pieces of eight a week. First week paid in advance. 

Guybrush: Sure, I'll give it a shot.

Barkeep: Great! The job is yours. Here's a week's worth of wages. Now, go strap
on an apron and get to work. 

Guybrush: Okeydokey.

LOCATION: Laundry

Marty: I'll see what we have ready for Mr. LaGrande.  I know it's here
somewhere. I saw it a while ago. Now where was it? Ah ... here it comes.

LOCATION: International house of Mojo

Voodoo Lady: Have you brought me more ingredients.

Guybrush: I have the bone of his Grandfather.

Voodoo Lady: Perfect. Do you have the final ingredient?

Guybrush: I have this pearly-white bra.

Voodoo Lady: Yes, that will work. At last! Now I can make a voodoo doll to be
reckoned with! Let me get my juju bag. And now for the ingredients ... A
dandruff flake from Largo's head! A single piece of Largo's thread! A drop of
fluid from his body! A single chip off the bone of the dead! And finally, some
miscellaneous voodoo herbs and seasonings, including monosodium glutamate. This
ought to be good. Two! Four! Six! Eight! Who do we assassinate? Largo! Largo!
Yeah!

Guybrush: Hey! That looks just like him! Thanks, Voodoo Lady.

Voodoo Lady: One more thing. Some of the ingredients were not the optimum
specimens. It should still work, but it will have a limited range. You will have
to get close to Largo. Very close.

LOCATION: Largo's room.

Largo: HEY! What are you doing in here?!? Get out of my room! And stay out!

Largo: Stop bothering me!

[Guybrush sticks a pin in the doll]

Largo: YOW!

Guybrush: Take that, you stumpy little dim-witted toad!

Largo: What?!? Who do you think you are?

Guybrush: I'm Guybrush Threepwood. People don't always recognize me. That's why
I carry this.

Largo: I'm gonna tear you limb from lib. 

[Guybrush sticks a pin in the doll]

Largo: How are you DOING that?

Guybrush: Largo LaGrande, you are a no-good, vicious, two-bit thug. I command
you to give me back my money and leave this island!

Largo: Ha! I already spent all your money!

Guybrush: Oh! Well, I command you to leave this island!

Largo: Just you try and make --

[Guybrush sticks a pin in the doll]

Largo: YOUCH! AIIEEE!!!  

Guybrush: That'll teach you to mess with the slayer of the Ghost Pirate LeChuck!

Largo: What's that? YOU killed LeChuck?

Guybrush: As a matter of fact, I did. Quite an interesting story, actually ...

Largo: The fortunate-teller said SHE did in LeChuck.

Guybrush: She did, did she? Does SHE have one of THESE?

Largo: Is that ... 

Guybrush: Yes. LeChuck's beard. Still alive and wriggling.

Largo: Let me see that ... Boy it IS alive! We've been looking for a living
piece of LeChuck for years! Now we can bring him back to life! Look out world!
The most fearsome pirate of all time will soon sail the seas again!

Guybrush: Whoops.

LOCATION: International house of Mojo

Voodoo Lady: I'm afraid it's true, Guybrush. If they have any animated tissue,
they can reanimate his whole body.

Guybrush: But I blew his body into a zillion gooey pieces!

Voodoo Lady: Not his body, Buybrush. You destroyed his spirit form. His body was
safely buried far away.

Guybrush: But by now it must be ...

Voodoo Lady: Rotten? Partially decomposed? Yes. And I don't think that's going
to make him any more pleasant to deal with.

Guybrush: He's going to be looking for me!

Voodoo Lady: Yes. 

Guybrush: He's going to try to kill me!!

Voodoo Lady: Undoubtedly.

Guybrush: Where can I hide?

Voodoo Lady: There is no place to hide. But there is a way out.

Guybrush: What is it?

Voodoo Lady: You're going it right now.

Guybrush: Fiddling with the change in my pockets.

Voodoo Lady: Hunting for Big Whoop.

Guybrush: Oh yeah, I was doing that, wasn't I?

Voodoo Lady: Big Whoop isn't just a treasure. It contains the secret to another
world. Find that world and you'll be able to escape LeChuck forever.

Guybrush: But I know so little about Big Whoop ...

Voodoo Lady: Take this book.

[Guybrush takes book]

Guybrush: &quot;Big Whoop: Unclaimed Bonanza or Myth&quot;. Where'd you get this?

Voodoo Lady: I checked it out at the Phatt City Library. I foresaw your need.

Guybrush: Gee, thanks.

Voodoo Lady: I used your name when I checked it out, so be sure and return it
when you're through reading. The overdue fines in Phatt City are pretty steep.

Guybrush: ... thanks.

LOCATION: Peninsula, Houseboat.

Guybrush: It's me again.

Captain Dread: So I see. What can I do for ya this time, mon?

Guybrush: I gotta run, lots of treasure hunt'n to do.

Captain Dread: OK, bye, mon. Come again.

Guybrush: Would you like my monocle?

Captain Dread: Thanks, mon. This will do just fine for my lucky sailing
necklace. What con I do for ya?

Guybrush: I need to charter a ship.

Captain Dread: You're in luck, my friend. Rumor has it that Largo's been run off
the island ... so I'm now free to sail again. Only problem is ... that you don't
look like the type that has 20 pieces of eight.

Guybrush: Actually, I do have that much.

Captain Dread: Well, mon. Consider my ship chartered.

Guybrush: Great! Where's you're ship?

Captain Dread: You're standing in it, mon.

Guybrush: Yikes.

ACTION: Part I Four Map Pieces

LOCATION: LeChuck's fortress

NARRATOR: Deep in the Caribbean, hidden by an endless storm, lies LeChuck's
fortress ...

Largo: So ... when are we going to resurrect the old bloated fool?  Oops ...

LeChuck: I'll ignore that comment just this one time, Largo ... only because
they tell me you've found Guybrush Threekwood.

Largo: It's 'Threepwood' ... and I've found him on Scabb Island.

LeChuck: Very good.

LeChuck: No one gets the upper hand on LeChuck without getting what he deserves.
I want Guybrush brought to me, and I want him brought alive. I am entrusting
this to you. Do not fail me.

Largo: Never, your voodoo lordship.

LeChuck: Aye! Guybrush Threepwood is finished. I need you to start building me a
very special doll.

Voodoo Priest: With pleasure.

LOCATION: Jolly Rasta.

Captain Dread: Welcome to the Jolly Rasta! Where do you want to go?

Guybrush: I don't know, what are my choices?

Captain Dread: I only know how to get to three islands, mon.

Guybrush: What are they?

Captain Dread: There's where we just came from, Scabb Island. The only island
where pirates are free to be pirates. Then there's Booty Island. The festive,
French, Mardi Gras, party-all-the-time, island. It's run by one of the most
respected and loved governors around ... Governor Elaine Marley.

Guybrush: Elaine?

Captain Dread: And last, there is Phatt Island. A fascist dictatorship, run by
an over-bloated pig named Governor Phatt. Here, take this easy-to-read reference
map, courtesy of Dread Tours. You can use it to show me where you want to go.

LOCATION: Phatt Island.

Guard: Excuse me, sir.

Guybrush: Yes?

Guard: Arent' you Guybrush Threepwood? 

Guybrush: Who wants to know?

Guard: I'm with the local constabulary, sir. You'd better come with me, Governor
Phatt would like a word with you.

Guybrush: Am I under arrest?

Guard: If you want to put it that way, sir, yes. 

Guybrush: Oh. All right, let's go. Coming!

LOCATION: Governor Phatt's bedroom.

Governor Phatt: Well, Mr. -- oh, excuse me.

[Food pumps out of tubes]

Governor Phatt: Well, Mr. Threepwood, I can't tell you how pleased I am to have
you here as my guest.

Guybrush: I can't say as I care much for your method of invitation.

Governor Phatt: I simply wanted to insure that you don't slip away before we had
a chance to meet. There's something I'd like to discuss.

Guybrush: Such as how much it must cost to keep you in food?

Governor Phatt: Be careful upon whose toes you tread, Mr. Threepwood. 

Guybrush: At least I can SEE your toes.

Governor Phatt: Why, you -- excuse me.

[Food pumps out of tubes]

Governor Phatt: Let's get down to why you're here, shall we? I intend to SELL
you. To the Ghost Pirate LeChuck.

Guybrush: LeChuck's dead. I killed him.

Governor Phatt: Perhaps you didn't kill him quite so thoroughly as you imagine.
He looked perfectly healthy the last time I saw him.

Guybrush: Last time you saw him?!? Oh No! LeChuck's back! 

ACTION: Food pumps out of tubes

Governor Phatt: I beg your pardon, did you say something?

Guybrush: He doesn't scare me. Just tell me where I can find him. 

Governor Phatt: I rather think he'll find YOU, Mr. Threepwood. You see, he's put
a sizable bounty on your head. 

Guybrush: Oh?

Governor Phatt: A bounty I intend to collect.

Guybrush: Oh. Whatever bounty LeChuck's offering, I'll double it.

Governor Phatt: Ha ha ha. Very amusing, Mr. Threepwood. Take him away!

Guard: Yes, sir, Governor Phatt. Come on, you little weasel!

Guybrush: I'll be BACK!

Guard: Come on!

LOCATION: Prison

Guard: Don't try to escape or anything Walt will chew you to bits. Ok, Walt,

why I'm know as &quot;The Blowfish&quot;.

Guybrush: You man &quot;The BlowHARD.&quot;

Fisherman: Listen bait-for-brains, I'm the best around and that's that.

Guybrush: What sort of wager were you thinking of?

Fisherman: If you can catch a bigger fish I can ... I'LL GIVE you my
prie-winning fishing pole.

Guybrush: What's the catch?

Fisherman: If I catch a bigger fish than YOU ... you have to eat it. RAW.

Guybrush: You mean, on rice with a little wasabi and soy sauce?

Fisherman: No. Plain, cold, and with the head still on it. What do you say?

Guybrush: All right, it's a bet.

Guybrush: All gone.

Retired pirate: It'll get you places in life, boy. Are you sure you don't want
to back out?

Guybrush: No, thanks. I'll be fine.

Retired pirate: You drink first.

[Guybrush drinks]

Guybrush: It's your turn.

[Retired pirate drinks and passes out]

LOCATION: Captain Dread's ship

Captain Dread: Where do you want to go?

LOCATION: LeChuck's fortress

NARRATOR: Yawn.

Largo: LeChuck, sir ... I've got good news and I've got bad news. The bad news
is that Guybrush has found the last piece of the map. Ah ... The good news is
that I've got a plan that can't fail. Ah ... You see ... He must take the map to
a cartographer to have it deciphered. I'll head him off before he gets there.

LeChuck: If your plan fails ... 

Largo: It will not, your voodoo lordship.

LOCATION: Cartographer's

Wally: Hello. What's this? A map? Hmmm ... Looks like only part of a map. 

Guybrush: I've got the rest of it right here.

Wally: Very interesting ... 

Guybrush: Can you put it all together into one map for me? 

Wally: I'll do it for you if you'll run an errand for me.

Guybrush: Go to the International House of Mojo and ask the fortune teller if my
love potion's ready.

Guybrush: Okay.

Wally: I'll try to have this done for you when you come back.

LOCATION: International House of Mojo.

Voodoo Lady: Back again, Mr. Threepwood?

Guybrush: Wally sent me to pick up some love potion. 

Voodoo Lady: Oh, OK. Tell him I said to enjoy, but to be careful. It's powerful
stuff. Wouldn't want that little guy getting hurt -- Wait! I just felt a sudden
disturbance in the Force ... As if a tiny, tiny voice just called out in fear
... and then hastily scratched a message in a table. I think Wally's in trouble,
and I think LeChuck has something to do with it!

Guybrush: Uh-oh. I'd better go check.

LOCATION: International House of Mojo

Delivery man: Hey, Rich. I could use a hand with this one. Looks like another
box of live snakes.

Rich: Sounds like it, too.

Delivery man: Well, let's get it on the truck. 

ACTION: Part III LeChuck's Fortress

NARRATOR: In the small crate of voodoo supplies that would be his home for the
next five days and nights, Guybrush is forced to eat bat lungs and eel bladders
to stay alive. Eventually, Guybrush and the rest of the slithering cargo are
delivered to the very doorstep of the Caribbean's most fearsom villain, living
or dead: The Ghost Pirate LeChuck!

Largo: Ah ... LeChuck's create of voodoo supplies. 

Delivery man: You know, we usually don't deliver out this far ...

Largo: You guys bucking for a tip?

Rich: Well, we figured since ...

Largo: Well you figured wrong. LeChuck don't tip nobody!

Rich: Gee ...

Delivery man: ... what a butt.

LOCATION: LeChuck's throne room.

LeChuck: Guybrush Threepwood ... You have finally been caught. I have searched
every island ... Sailed every sea ... And now you are mine. What do you have to
say for yourself?

Guybrush: gulp!

Largo: Yes sir, LeChuck, sir?

LeChuck: Take Guybrush down to the torture chamber and get the machine set up.

Largo: Yes sir.

LeChuck: Hahahaha ... You be in a heap of trouble Guybrush Threepwood. Now that
you are mine, you will pay for what you did to me.

Guybrush: Hey ... What's a little root beer between freinds ...

LeChuck: Silence! There is only one thing more painful than being resurrected
from the dead and crammed into a rotting body. Do you know what that is?

Guybrush: Hmmm ... 

LeChuck: It is what is about to happen to you!

Guybrush: Can't we talk this thing out?

LeChuck: You see that candle over there? When it burns through that rope,  ...
the bag will fall on the bellows. When it is compressed, it will shoot a single
lead bullet ... which will ricochet off that pan ... then off the shield behind
me ... bounce off that other shield ... finally striking the green balloon. When
it pops, it will cause that lever to fall ... releasing that ratchet on the
chain wheel ... and sending you down into the pit of acid.

Guybrush: Geee ... I ...

LeChuck: Do you know what happens next? 

Guybrush: Ummmm ... well

LeChuck: I will take your bones ...still alive and in great pain ...and make
them into a chair. I will call it my screaming chair. Every morning I will sit
in it and listen to you scream.  Any questions?

Guybrush: Where's the bathroom?

LeChuck: Up the stairs and to the left, but you won't need it in a few minutes.

Guybrush: Have you ever tried conditioner on that beard?

LeChuck: No.

Guybrush: How much wood would a woodchuck chuck, if a 

LeChuck: I am growing tired of your stupid questions. Prepare to die.

Wally: He didn't say what he was going to do me?

Guybrush: An ottoman comes to mind.

[Guybrush spits on the first shield]

Wally: Hey! Watch it with the spit!

[Guybrush spits on the candle]

LeChuck: Arggggg! What be going on in here? LARGO! Relight the candle!

LeChuck: GUYBRUSH HAS ESCAPED! Find them!

Guybrush: Ha! I bet LeChuck is really cheesed-off now!

Wally: Yep.

Guybrush: Hey, Wally? 

Wally: Yeah?

Guybrush: Where are we?

Wally: Good question.

Guybrush: Holy Skunk Sweat!! Ouch!

ACTION: Part IV Dinky Island

LOCATION: Dinky Island

NARRATOR: Hours later ...

Parrot: Polly wants a cracker. No, no, no, that's not right. BRAAAK. Oh, the
heck with it. Let's make a map, and tear it into four pieces. Gee, Captain
Marley, where should we bury the treasure? OK, let's go over it again so no one
forgets where we buried the treasure. I want my granddaughter to marry a REAL
man, a CAPTAIN.

Guybrush: Herman Toothrot! What are you doing here?

Herman: Oh, hi. I've been waiting for you. 

Guybrush: What do you mean you've been waiting for me?

Herman: Our meeting comes at this, the final moment of my existence so far. All
else has been in anticipation of this event.

Guybrush: What happens now that I'm here?

Herman: The moment has passed, and we face the future. Now our meeting is
nothing more than another note in the grand overture to the next passage.

Guybrush: I'm looking for a treasure. Have you seen any?

Herman: There are many treasures here, found and unfound. The beauty of the
ocean, for example. Or the treasure of the past, seen in the rings of trees of
the half-remembered cacklings of a parrot ....

Guybrush: Actually, I'm looking for the treasure of Big Whoop?

Herman: Big Whoop? I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that one.

Guybrush: I think I have better things to do than talk to you.

Herman: I think you will find that the concept of 'better things' is the
frailest of illusions.

Parrot: BRAAK. BRAAK. No, no no, that's not right. OK, let's go over it one more
time. OK, let's go over it again so no one forgets where we buried the treasure.

Guybrush: Pretty Polly. 

Parrot: Gee, Captain Marley, where should we bury the treasure? OK, let's go
over it again so no one forgets where we buried the treasure. Polly wants a
cracker.

[Guybrush gives the parrot a cracker]

Parrot: Head due east from the pond to the dinosaur. Oh, the heck with it. Let's
make a map and tear it into four pieces.

[Guybrush follows trail]

Parrot: Head due east from the pond to the dinosaur. Head north from the
dinosaur to the pile of rocks. I want my granddaughter to marry a REAL man, a
CAPTAIN.

[Guybrush follows trail]

Parrot: Poly wants a cracker. Head north from the dinosaur to the pile of rocks.
Head due east from the rocks to the X.

[Guybrush follows trail]

Herman: Oh, you meant THIS treasure. Why didn't you say so? You could have come
by the shortcut, like I do.

Guybrush: Shortcut?

Parrot: Oh, the heck with it. Let's make a map and tear it into four pieces.

[Guybrush uses dynamite to dig at the big X]

LOCATION: Govenor Marley's mansion.

Elaine: Great Scott! That came form the direction of Dinkey Island. That idiot
must be messing with my grandfather's treasure. I'd better get over there.

LOCATION: Cavern under the ground.

Guybrush: ... and you showed up about three days later. Will you help menow?

Elaine: Anything to shut you up. That has to be have been the longest story I've
ever heard.

[Guybrush falls into the cavern]

Elaine: Oh, dear.

LOCATION: Undergound corridor.

LeChuck: Boo!

Guybrush: Eek!

LeChuck: Hello, Guybrush. 

Guybrush: Goodbye, LeChuck.

LeChuck: You won't escape me this time!

Guybrush: I escaped from you before, I can easily do it again.

LeChuck: Not so fast! Even if you were to escape, I would always be able to find
you again. We are bound to one another.

Guybrush: Like dreadlocks?

LeChuck: Yes, rather like that. Or like ... brothers!

Guybrush: Huh?

LeChuck: I -- am your brother!

Guybrush: No! No, that's not true! That's impossible.

LeChuck: Search your feelings, you KNOW it to be true!

Guybrush: Noooooooo!!!

LeChuck: ... and I've brought a little surprise for you!

Guybrush: I don't suppose it's a LucasArts™ game ...

LeChuck: No.

[LeChuck pulls out voodoo doll]

Guybrush: Say, that wouldn't happen to be a voodoo doll, would it.

LeChuck: Why yes, as a matter of fact it IS a voodoo doll ... which I'll be
using to torture you ... and then send you screaming to another dimension, one
of infinite pain!  Observe ...

[LeChuck stabs the doll]

Guybrush: Are you quite finished?

LeChuck: No, I want to do this: 

[LeChuck twists the doll]

LeChuck: That was exhilarating! Let's have some more fun, shall we?

[LeChuck twists the doll]

Guybrush: Please! No more!

LeChuck: OK, time to send you screaming to a dimension of infinite pain!

[LeChuck stabs the doll]

Guybrush: Aaaiiiiieeee!!!!

LeChuck: At last, I'm rid of that pesky little whimp Guybrush!

Guybrush: Hey, I'm alive!

LeChuck: Eh?

Guybrush: I thought I was a goner! Whoops ...

LeChuck: Strange ... There must be something wrong with my voodoo doll. It was
supposed to send you to another dimension, not the next room. Shoddy materials,
I'll bet. Well, I guess I'll just try it again.

Guybrush: Uh, no that's OK, I -- 

[LeChuck stabs the doll, Guybrush is transported to another room]

LeChuck: Now you're gonna get it!

Guybrush: Here, try this.

[Guybrush gives clean hanky to LeChuck, who blows his nose in it]

Guybrush: Now, isn't that better? Let bygones be bygones.

[LeChuck stabs the doll, Guybrush is transported to another room]

LeChuck: Hey, a Susan B. Anthony!

[Guybrush steals LeChuck's underwear]

LeChuck: Now you're gonna get it!

Guybrush: Let bygones be bygones.

[LeChuck stabs the doll, Guybrush is transported to another room]

LeChuck: Hey, Guybrush! It's voodoo time!

Guybrush: Are you sure you want to do this?

[LeChuck stabs the doll, Guybrush is transported to another room]

LeChuck: Now you're gonna get it!

Guybrush: Let's bury the hatchet. Let bygones be bygones.

[LeChuck stabs the doll, Guybrush is transported to another room]

LeChuck: Now you're gonna get it! 

[Guybrush closes elevator doors on LeChuck's beard]

LeChuck: Hey! Ouch! Hey!

LOCATION: Meelee Island (set of the Secret of Monkey Island).

Guybrush: This is hauntingly familiar.

LOCATION: Underground tunnels.

LeChuck: Now you're gonna get it! 

[Guybrush stabs the LeChuck voodoo doll]

LeChuck: That's pretty good, Guybrush ... but not good enough to stop ME!

LeChuck: Eh? Oh, it's you. What, THAT again? Ooh, look at me quakin' in me
booties. I laugh at you and your puny voodoo tinkerings. Hah! I can take it

Guybrush:  Take THIS, LeChuck!

LeChuck: I'm much too powerful for you and your puny doll. It doesn't hurt.

Guybrush: You know, this doll reminds me of the stretchy Muscleman I had as a
kid.

[Guybrush twists the LeChuck voodoo doll]

LeChuck: Ha! You don't scare me!

Guybrush: I wonder what would happen if I tore the leg off this thing?

[Guybrush tears the LeChuck voodoo doll]

LeChuck:  ... argh ... Guyrbush ... -- ghack -- 

Guybrush: What?

LeChuck: Come over here.

Guybrush: No way, I'm not that stupid.

LeChuck: But I want you to -- gag -- take my mask off ... choke ... see the TRUE
face of your brother ...

Guybrush: Oh, all right, I'm coming over.

LeChuck: Gently now, remove my -- hack -- mask.

Guybrush: My god, you're ... my creepy brother Chuckie.

LeChuck: What, did you think I was kidding before?

Guybrush: Why have you been chasing me all over the place?

LeChuck: Our mother told me to hunt you down.

Guybrush: When our mother told you to hunt me down, did she actually mention
KILLING me, or was that your idea?

LeChuck: Look, Guybrush, could you help me out? Stick the leg back on the doll,
OK?

Guybrush: Will you promise not to hold me down and spit on me anymore?

LeChuck: All right, all right, I promise! Anything, just put my leg back on!

Rich: Hey, you kids! You're not supposed to be in here!

LOCATION: Fairground

Dad: Ah, so there you are!

Guybrush: What's going on?

Dad: We're scolding you for running off. Your mother and I were very concerned. 

Mom: Thank you for hunting down your brother like we asked, Chuckie dear. 

Dad: You boys didn't get in any trouble, now, did you?

Guybrush: No, sir.

LeChuck: No, sir.

Mom: I wish you wouldn't run off like that, young man. We were worried sick. You
don't know what kinds of murderers and ne'er do wells might be hanging around a
place like this. 

Guybrush: I'm Guybrush Threepwood, a mighty pirate. I don't have to worry about
stuff like that.

Mom: Of course, dear. But please be careful.

Dad: Well, come on then, let's go ride the Madly Rotating Buccaneer.

Guybrush: Yeah!

[Child LeChuck's eyes light up evily as we see Guybrush walk away into Big Whoop
Theme Park]

LOCATION: Dinky Island

Elaine: I wonder what's keeping Guybrush? I hope LeChuck hasn't cast some
horrible SPELL over him or anything.
