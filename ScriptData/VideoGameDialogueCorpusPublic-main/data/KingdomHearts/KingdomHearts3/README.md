# Kingdom Hearts 3

## Source

This source is 'high' in terms of completeness, but doesn't cover (at least some) optional NPC dialogue. There are instances of missing party dialogue too (albeit in a tutorial).

## Character coding

Young Xenahort is the younger, time-travelling version of Master Xenahort. The wiki treats them as separate characters, so I've coded them accordingly. Young Eraqus has a different voice actor to Master Eraqus but both are on the same wiki page - for symmetry I've coded them separately (but everyone in this paragraph is male, so it doesn't affect the split). Dark Riku is more obviously a distinct character from Riku (see https://kingdomhearts.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Riku), but also seemingly from the Riku Replica. Anti-Aqua is specifically stated to be a corrupted form of Aqua (and is returned to her light form after a result of Sora's intervention), so I've coded 'Anti-Aqua' as an alias. "Young Anna" and "Young Elsa" are treated as aliases for Anna and Elsa respectively. 

Baymax's gender isn't listed on the fan wikis. Although the original marvel character had a human male form, the Disney version isn't as obviously gendered, although the wiki uses male pronouns throughout (as does the Big Hero 6 fan wiki), the voice actor in the film (from which the game character is taken) is male and speaks about the character using male pronouns. I've thus coded him as male. 

The Chirithy in KH3 is referred to with female pronouns in the wiki and has female voice actors in both English and Japanese (although it's not uncommon for women to be cast to play 'childlike' voices, male or female, so this isn't decisive). There don't appear to be any pronouns in the dialogue in the script, but the 'action' descriptions refer to Chirithy as male. I don't get a clear read on their gender from their in-game appearance. There are suggestions here (https://www.khinsider.com/forums/index.php?threads/the-split-between-kingdom-hearts-x-and-unchained-x.213723/) that Chirithy self-refers with a male pronoun in the Japanese. Due to uncertainty I've coded Chirithy as neutral. 

CDA agents don't have obvious visual gender signifiers or a gender in the wiki, but they are voiced in tropey'government agent' style with a male voice actor, so I have coded them accordingly. 

"Everyone" pertains to different groups (4 lines in total) - I've coded as neutral as it's very difficult to track down the particular lines/who is talking, although from context it looks like a mix of genders. 

Marshmallow is the giant abominable snowcreature that Elsa creates - it has a deep monstrous voice but one might think lacks a clear-cut gender, I was thus tempted to code as neutral. However several in-game characters use 'he' so I coded as male. 

Lingering Will is an animated suit of armour, so I've coded as neutral. 

The character named "Woman" in the script can be seen/heard at 27:48 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPVG8GmcLB4, and "Girl" at 18:04. "Citizen" can be heard at 5:03 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJegFyhrOeQ and sounds male. "Narrator" can be heard at 0:26 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIqzfTyBKys - in keeping with the Hercules film narration, this is a male Charlton Heston-style voice. 

"Star 13" is Namine, and "Star" is known in the fan community as "Nameless Star" and recognised as female. The other stars (2-12) are unvoiced and thus - given a lack of other gender clues - coded as neutral. 

"Action 7 News" can be heard here (36:00) - as is tropey, the newscaster's voice is female. 



Finally, there is some dialogue missing from the game - I noticed while watching a gameplay video that (at least some of) the unnamed NPCs you can button-press to interact with don't have their lines captured (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPVG8GmcLB4). The major dialogue seems (?) fairly well captured, so I don't think this is a major issue, but just flagging in case we're noting that sort of thing anywhere. It might be that cut-scene/unavoidable dialogue is in the script but optional interactions aren't. (This trend repeats here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJegFyhrOeQ).
