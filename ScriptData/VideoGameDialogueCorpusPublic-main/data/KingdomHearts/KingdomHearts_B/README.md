# Kingdom Hearts

## Source

The source represents voiced dialogue. Text-based (unvoiced) dialogue isn't captured in the source. This is usually optional, incidental dialogue. Dialogue options are not marked, and the source represents the dialogue that a player might experience in one playthrough.

Original parsing is from [here](https://transcripts.fandom.com/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts) parsed by the parser "fandomParser2", but that wiki was closed. The source was a copy of [this script](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps3/684080-kingdom-hearts-hd-15-remix/faqs/68066).
