# Kingdom Hearts 2

## Character coding

DiZ is an alias for Ansem the Wise (although they look quite different - one is in disguise). This isn't a case of an unnamed character becoming a named character, so I'm treating it like Shamir from KQVI and not recording it as an alias. Both DiZ and Ansem are male, so it won't affect the gender count. There are several other similar cases. First, Ping is Mulan dressed as a male. The other characters read Ping as male, but the audience might well - knowing Mulan - treat Ping as female. I've coded Ping as male (following the Shamir example) and Mulan as female. Secondly, Captain Pete is a past version of Pete (although they don't recognise each other). They are grouped together on the fan wiki as the same person, so I've coded this as an alias.

I was concerned there would be overlap between Chip (of Chip'n'Dale) and Chip (Mrs Potts' son), but although the latter is mentioned in the 'action' descriptions, he doesn't have any dialogue. 

"MCP" is described as having a male face and with male pronouns in the fan wiki; his voice artist is male. I have coded all the 'pirate' characters as male (as per the 'undead pirate' fan wiki page). "Voice" is currently under male (as I think it's the voice of Ansem the Wise/DiZ), but I haven't put it in as an alias (waiting to see how KH1 is dealt with). I've coded "Everyone" as neutral, as I'm not sure who all it encompasses. 

The only two I'm not sure about are lines below, which are voiced members of Organisation XIII off-screen; I can't identify by sound or googling which members say them:

```json
	{"??????": "You called?"},
	{"ACTION": "All four of them look around and see no one. Sora runs out into an open area"},
	{"??????": "Youâ€™re doing well."},
```
	
"Dusk (neutral)" is not assigned a gender on the fan wiki, so has been coded "neutral".
