## Gender Coding

The Black Guard are anthropomorphic programs in the TRON world. The other characters in this world have gender identified in the wiki; the Black Guard do not. However they have sprites similar to other male characters and male voice actors, so I have coded them as "male". There is more than one "Black Guard" but they are indistinguishable both in-game and in the script. 

"Announcer" can be heard around 12:05 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTx4nEAi3w. The voice sounds female so I have coded accordingly.
