## Gender coding

"Dawnguard Lieutenant" is female, as seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4SopfSpjB8

Necromancer is coded as female here: https://www.wattpad.com/amp/250843576

According to the wiki (https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Hold_Guard): 

> Only Stormcloak-affiliated Holds have female guards.

Thus, guards from holds without Stormcloak affiliation are reasonably coded as male (e.g. Whiterun Guard, at the point of the game in which the dialogue appears). "Whiterun Guard" is a generic. 

The wiki has a list of male and female characters in Skyrim, which is a helpful resource. Noticeably the dragons are absent, but gendered pronouns are used for them throughout the game's dialogue. E.g. 

> "It's Durnehviir...he's here!"

The Daedric Princes also do not appear in the gendered character lists, although again they are referred to with gendered pronouns in the game and in the wiki. The wiki notes (https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Daedric_Princes): 

> While Daedra can manifest as either male or female (being, in reality, genderless), all of these high Daedra are typically referred to as "Princes.

We are coding for conferred gender, and so I have left the gendered coding for the Daedric Princes where appropriate (i.e. where there are gendered pronouns and other evidence relative to their given appearance), however those with other purposes might handle this differently. So, for instance, Clavicus is coded as male: 

> "My master is Clavicus Vile, Daedric prince of wishes. As you can imagine, he's quite the important person."

And Boethiah as female (although Boethiah appears as male in some other Elder Scrolls instalments): 

> "But a Daedric Lord has his enemies, and my rival Boethiah had her priest desecrate the altar."

There are different incarnations of Pelagius during the Mind of Madness quest (https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mind_of_Madness), however since they seem to be representations of parts of his personality, I've left them coded as the same person for our purposes. 

"Dawnguard Lieutenant" appears here: https://youtu.be/EJ6D5N45zy4; have left the coding as female. 

The "Agent" NPCs belong to the Penitus Oculatus. Their dialogue appears here: https://youtu.be/sRoaf3sz0Ko.

Bandit 1 and Bandit 2 can be heard here: https://youtu.be/OWjYGnm3HhI?t=700. 

Cultist can be heard here https://youtu.be/If4kuM9uTKU and https://youtu.be/HXtXOmIGE9E. 

Stormcloak 1 and 2 can be heard here https://youtu.be/hXYqG6zRmXU?t=109.

"Imperial Soldier" is a generic, but best I can tell they all seem to be voiced by a male voice actor (usually but not always Gideon Emry). This is opposed to the stormcloaks, who have both females and males in their ranks. 

Most of the Stormcloak instances are straightforward to track down, but some lines are easily missed if combat is triggered prematurely (e.g. "Look out! Draugr!"). Where possible I've coded them by gender, otherwise where there is insufficient evidence it's neutral. 

The Silverhand lines can be heard here: https://youtu.be/2IMDSmo-QjQ?t=252

Soldier 1 and Soldier 2 can be heard here: https://youtu.be/FvB9tYGSj2I?t=24

Conversation between the vampire and fledgling in Dimhollow can be heard here: https://youtu.be/6xALsIN0Xyw?t=22.

"Thalmor Wizard" is heard here: https://youtu.be/eaBHy2opx3c?t=121 

Wizards' Guards can be male or female, but those closest to Aicantar (as in the data file) seem to be male - see https://youtu.be/Gv-oDLQlxNo?t=606. Could be revisited. 

"Morokei", the undead dragon priest, is described with male pronouns in the wiki (https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Morokei_(Skyrim)) and has a male voice actor. I've coded as male, but this could be revisited. 

"Wizards' Guard" is male, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQnd51zb7E8

"Vampire (with Lokil)" is female, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qpl2WFpmqH4
