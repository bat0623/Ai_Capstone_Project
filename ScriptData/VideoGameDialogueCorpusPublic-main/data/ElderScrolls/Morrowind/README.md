# The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind

## Source

The scraper downloads all of the pages listed in the wiki under ['Morrowind Characters'](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Morrowind:_Characters). Some of these pages include dialogue, but not necessarily for every character that has unique dialogue nor all the dialogue for a given character. So this is classed as a 'sample'.

## Character coding

Character coding started from using the gender coding on the wiki.
