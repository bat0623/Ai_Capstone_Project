<dd><b>Disappearance of the Dwarves</b> <i>"Concerning this, I can only speak to a friend."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Disappearance of the Dwarves (high disposition)</b> <i>"It was unfashionable among the Dwemer to view their spirits as synthetic constructs three, four, or forty creational gradients below the divine. During the Dawn Era they researched the death of the Earth Bones, what we call now the laws of nature, dissecting the process of the sacred willing itself into the profane. I believe their mechanists and tonal architects discovered systematic regression techniques to perform the reverse -- that is, to create the sacred from the deaths of the profane. As the Dwemer left no corpses or traces of conflict behind, I believe that generations of ritualistic 'anti-creation' resulted in their immediate, but foreseen removal from the Mundus. They retreated behind math, behind color, behind the active principle itself. That the Dwemer vanished during a conflict with Nerevar and the Tribunal is merely coincidence."</i></dd></dl></dd>

<dl><dd><b>Ragas gra-Shuzgrub</b> <i>"She came demanding tribute for the Empire of men. I was here before Gnisis, before the Empire of men. I will be here after Gnisis is gone and after this short-lived Empire has crumbled. The people of Gnisis live only because I tolerate them. Why should I pay tribute?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>Ragash learned her lesson.</b> <i>"What? So soon? Even the short-lived orcs need time to reflect on their transgressions."</i></dd>
<dd><b>Let her go and no one will trouble you again.</b> <i>"You trouble me now. Do you think I have nothing better to do than listen to such lies? Leave now or you shall join the orc in my prison."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Let her go and no one will trouble you again. (High disposition)</b> <i>"Can you make such a promise? I do not know if I should trust you... But I shall. Take this key and take the orc with you when you leave."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>Everyone pays taxes.</b> <i>"I do not pay tribute to any man. Do not anger me, or you shall join the orc in my prison."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Divine Metaphysics</b> <i>"Yes, I can now translate these books. This first one is Bthuand Mzahnch's refutation of a popular theory from Nerevar's time. A few tones of Dwemer believed that using the power Lorkhan's Heart was an unjustifiable risk. "The <b>Egg of Time</b>" contains Bthuand's arguments against this idea, many of which are quite compelling. The next book, "<b>Divine Metaphysics</b>," is an explanation of how the Dwemer tried to make a new god, Anumidium, using Kagrenac's tools and the sacred tones on Lorkhan's heart."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Divine Metaphysics</b> <i>"This is an explanation of how the Dwemer tried to make a new god, Anumidium, using Kagrenac's tools and the sacred tones on Lorkhan's heart. It has several interesting theories about how to bend the Ehlnofey or "Earth Bones," but I am not entirely sure I understand it myself. Perhaps after another century of study I could have a better answer for you."</i></dd>

<dd><b>Hanging Gardens</b> <i>"So you have found a book. Let me see... Yes, this is written in both Dwemer and Aldmeris. I would keep this book somewhere safe. Perhaps you will find other books in the Dwemer language, and could use this book to translate them. If you find anything of interest, bring both the books to me."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>three questions</b> <i>"You may ask your three questions. You want to know first about the <b>disappearance of the Dwarves</b>?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>Disappearance of the Dwarves</b> <i>"It was unfashionable among the Dwemer to view their spirits as synthetic constructs three, four, or forty creational gradients below the divine. During the Dawn Era they researched the death of the Earth Bones, what we call now the laws of nature, dissecting the process of the sacred willing itself into the profane.

<dl><dd><b>three questions</b> <i>"You may ask your three questions. You said something about <b>Dwemer artifacts</b>?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>Dwemer artifacts</b> <i>"In their denial of both phenomena and noumena, the Dwemer found comfort in the creation of Animunculi, which in their operation, combined two incompatible principles, thus denying both. In the first Dwemer ruin I studied, quite by chance in my wandering youth, someone had activated the Animunculi guardians and I was unable to make a proper study of them. Since then, I have, on occasion, found ruins, especially here in Vvardenfell, where the Animunculi are still active."</i>
<dl><dd><b>three questions</b> <i>"You may ask your three questions. Did you not say your last question was about the <b>Dwemer language</b>?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>Dwemer language</b> <i>"The Dwemer language is unknown, perhaps unknowable. Some Dwemer books, especially records dating from after the founding of Resdayn, were written in Aldmeris, making them accessible to modern scholars. However, even in Aldmeris, many Dwemer terms remain uncertain. As the books and other artifacts in <b>Dwemer ruins</b> rarely show signs of wear or age, I believe that the Dwemer knew of a preservative effect, perhaps a device still active which denies or controls the Earth Bones governing time and decay."</i>
<dl><dd><b>Dwemer ruins</b> <i>"You seem to truly have an interest in the Dwarves, so I will tell you this. Sneak into the Gnisis Eggmine. I heard they made a most unusual discovery recently."</i></dd>
