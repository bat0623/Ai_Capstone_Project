<dl><dd><b>mabrigash</b> <i>"What? You want me to go live with the witch-women? Do you think I am a fool like Jocien? Do you think I would fall for their charms?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>Are you afraid of a few women?</b> <i>"I am a hunter of the Erabinimsun. I have proven my bravery many times against the war-loving Erabinimsun who think all the peace-lovers are cowards."</i>
<dl><dd><b>So you ARE afraid.</b> <i>"I will show you that I am not afraid of any witch-woman. I will follow you to the mabrigash camp."</i></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>Are you sure you can resist their charms?</b> <i>"Mimanu tried her charms on me. I let her think they were working and escaped the next morning."</i>
