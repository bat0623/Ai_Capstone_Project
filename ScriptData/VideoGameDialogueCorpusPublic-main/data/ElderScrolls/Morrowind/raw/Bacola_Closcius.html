But I happen to know that Banor Seran just took delivery of some Cyrodilic brandy. He's probably got it stored in the closet in the hall just right of the bar. Now of course it would be WRONG to steal that brandy. Even though EVERYONE knows the Council Club is just a front for those Camonna Tong gangsters. But for such a good cause...."</i>
