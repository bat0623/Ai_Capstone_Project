<p><i>"Greetings, friend. How can I help you? We have an excellent selection of glassware, although getting more <b>exotic items</b> has become very difficult."</i>

<dl><dd><b>exotic items</b> <i>"Well, some of the finer materials are hard to come by these days. While it would be nice to have such items as <b>dwarven limeware</b>, it has become too difficult to obtain it."</i>
<dl><dd><b>dwarven limeware</b> <i>"It didn't used to be as much of a problem, but Bolryn at the East Empire Company has been manipulating the prices; I'm sure of it. And he won't give most of us a license to sell the stuff. Actually, I know for a fact that there's a shipment of limeware being held up on a ship in Ebonheart. If you'd be willing to...recover it for me...I would be willing to reward you very generously. Perhaps 1,500 drakes?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>I'll get the limeware for you.</b> <i>"Excellent. You can find the limeware aboard the Chun-Ook, docked in Ebonheart. It is likely to be very well guarded, so take care. There should be at least ten pieces of it...bowls and cups, I believe. Anything else you find -- flasks, plates, or platters -- is probably fake, so leave it behind."</i>
<dl><dd><b>dwarven limeware</b> <i>"I would be good to get my hands on that shipment. Let me know when you get the pieces."</i></dd></dl></dd>
