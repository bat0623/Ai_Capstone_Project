<dd><b>Divayth Fyr</b> <i>"He's up above in his study. I hope you can fly. You can't get up there unless you can fly. Or have potions. Sorry."</i></dd>
<dd><b>plunder the dungeon</b> <i>"You'd be surprised how many people come in here trying to steal Lord Fyr's treasures. He does have quite a collection of relics and artifacts. But he keeps them down in the Corprusarium. And who wants to risk catching corprus disease? Not to mention who wants to get ripped in half. Pity. We don't see many good thieves here. Just the stupid ones."</i></dd>
<dd><b>wife of Divayth Fyr</b> <i>"Yes. Well. Not 'wife' in the 'married' sense. But... you know. 'Paramour.' 'Consort.' Something like that. It's a bit awkward, really. Because... well... he made us, too, so, though we aren't really his daughters or anything, it's LIKE we were his daughters. Because he made us. You see?"</i></dd></dl>
