<p><b>Greeting</b> <i>"Stranger! Yes, you! Please, can you help me? I've been attacked by a couple of bastard Ashlanders who robbed me and left me for dead."</i>

<dl><dd><b>Greeting</b> <i>"I can't believe those damned Ashlanders would take my hides! Dirty fetchers, all of them."</i></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>bastard Ashlanders</b> <i>"I'd know them anywhere. They looked kind of like normal dark elves, but wild. They wore animal skins and had tattoos. And they had odd hair. They should be easy to spot, friend. It's no surprise they robbed me."</i></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>robbed me</b> <i>"Yes, the bastard n'wahs nearly killed me, and they took my entire shipment of guar hides. It's easy to tell they're mine; they have my damn mark on them! Look, if you can help me get those hides back, and kill the fetchers who stole them, I promise you an excellent reward. Although I have nothing left since I was attacked, my friend Berwen in Tel Mora will be most generous, I promise you. What do you say?"</i>
<dl><dd><b>"I'm sorry. You'll have to find them yourself."</b> <i>"Figures. No one left in this world willing to help an honest trader."</i>
<dl><dd><b>robbed me</b> <i>"It was those damned Ashlanders, I tell you. Took my guar hides! I'll teach them to steal Athanden Girith's guar hides!"</i>
<dl><dd><b>Girith's guar hides</b> <i>"Yeah, those bastard Ashlanders took my entire shipment. It's easy to identify mine; they have my mark on them."</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>"I'll see if I can find your hides for you."</b> <i>"Excellent. Go get those bastard Ashlanders. I promise, when you get those hides back to me, Berwen will be very generous. She has a stake in this trade, after all, and we can't let an unwarranted attack on a guar hide trader ruin business."</i>
