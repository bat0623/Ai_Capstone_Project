I can fill your belly, but first, I need to know. Will you kill in order to fill this void?","Wonderful. You should see the look in your eyes, %pcf. You will be mighty, I can see it in them. Now, your stepping stone to power is a vampiric ancient who has displeased me, =monster_. Know that %g is a mighty adversary, and %g3 asylum, ___mondung_, is well protected. But you can and will kill %g2. Once you have, go to my darling friend, _qgfriend_ over at __qgfriend_ in ___qgfriend_. _qgfriend_ is a busy person, so don't keep %g2 waiting more than =1stparton_ days. _qgfriend_ will have a present for you that I think will make you very happy. Farewell, %pcf. We will meet again, I know.","No?! Now you taunt me, %pcf. You tempt me out of my dark palace and then shun my company. If I thought you were merely being cruel, I could respect it.

Go, go to a place called ___mondung_, where the object of my gallous desires doth trip and pose and wear blackberry crowns. Wait ... do not invite this battlemage to tea with me. Now I remember.

Then go from ___mondung_ to a lunatic asylum called ___contactdung_ and see my =qgfriend_, _qgfriend_. _artifact_ for you %g will have.

My agent, _contact_ will await you in ___contact_. _contact_ does not like to wait so accomplish the murder in =1stparton_ days or less. I have the delicious feeling we'll see each other again, %pcf.

The particular innocent I have in mind is a _monster_. You're probably thinking, an innocent lich? Well, innocent to you.

I'll give you =queston_ days to get the book out of ___mondung_ and return. After that time, the _gold_ gold pieces will be forfeit. The name of the book is _book_. Good luck, %pcf.",Very well. I'll look for a different mercenary then.
K0C00Y09#_qgiver_,male,"My former partner here at __qgiver_, a _enemy_, has taken more than %g3 fair share of our profits and run away from ___qgiver_. Now, I'm not the vengeful sort, but I would appreciate it if you would bring the _enemy_ back to me, so I can get some explanation for this remarkable behavior. I'll pay you _gold_ gold pieces for %g2 alive, and _lessgold_ gold if you accidentally kill %g2. // That damnable _enemy_ let me trust %g2, led me merrily along, and then left without a word but with a sizeable portion of my savings. Now the money does bother me, but not as much as the betrayal. I want you to track %g2 down, and bring %g2 to me, and I'm willing to pay _gold_ gold pieces for it. Are you willing and able? // I am looking for a manhunter, or, more specifically, a _enemy_ hunter. You see, %g left town without paying the gold %g owes me. It's the principle of the thing. I don't mind paying you _gold_ gold pieces for %g3 capture, but my reputation would be ruined if I let my debtors just leave ___qgiver_, owing me gold. Will you get this deadbeat for me?","Good. The _enemy_'s name is =enemy_, and rumor has it that %g is holed up in ___mondung_ for =queston_ days at most. That will be the deadline by which I expect to hear from you. Remember -- =enemy_ is a tough _enemy_, so expect a fight, but try not to kill %g2. I want %g2 alive, not dead. Good luck, %pcf. // That's fine then. My sources tell me that the _enemy_ has taken refuge in ___mondung_ and will probably be there for =queston_ days or so. I fully expect =enemy_, that's the _enemy_'s name, to put up a fight, but try not to kill %g2. I will expect you back in =queston_ days. Good luck. // Frightfully good of you, %pcf. I've made some inquiries and it seems that our _enemy_ friend is lurking about the vicinity of ___mondung_, unguarded and alone except for the usual brutes in residence. =enemy_ is %g3 name and I will expect %g2 before me in =queston_ days, preferably alive. Don't disappoint me.","No? Well, I'll just go down to the Fighters Guild and hire someone else. // That's too bad. Let me know if you change your mind."
K0C01Y00#_qgiver_,random,"Imagine the purity of my delight when my sniveling, cheating lover of the past two years was abducted and presumably killed. Then imagine my despair when I discovered that the =victim_ was still among the living. Next, imagine my amusement when %g3 kidnappers demanded a ransom. Finally, please imagine my annoyance when %g3 cousin actually agreed to pay the ransom. This cannot be. I need someone to make certain that the ransoming fails. Will you help me?","%oth, %oth, and %oth. The way I see it, there are three ways to stop this ransoming. One is to make sure that dear _victim_ accidentally dies before the ransom date in =queston1_ days. Of course, I don't know where %g is, so that's a difficult one. The next option is to see to %g3 cousin's accidental death within the same time frame. Now, =cousin_, that's the cousin, lives in ___mondung2_, which is a well-fended fortress. So there's a difficulty there. Finally, you could remove the _gem_ from ___mondung2_ that =cousin_ plans to use for the ransom. Whatever way you do it, be back here with the news in =queston1_ days or sooner, and you'll be _gold_ gold richer. Good luck, old %ra.","%oth, what an attitude. Your selfish morality will get you in trouble some day."
K0C01Y10#_qgiver_,male,"You're %pcn, yes? The one who was shipwrecked?","I thought so. That storm that destroyed your boat was no natural winter squall, but I guess you suspected as much. I will gladly tell you what I know about it, if you will find a particular rare scroll for me. This is not the type of job I could give to the Fighters Guild, for the scroll is protected by some powerful daedra spirits and has the power to summon creatures from the plane of Oblivion. Go to ___mondung_, find the scroll, and bring it back to me before =queston_ days have passed and I will tell you what I know about the tempest that nearly destroyed you.","That's funny. You look just like %pcn. Oh, well."
K0C0XY01#_qgiver_,male,"I have a not uncommon situation on my hands. A nest of harpies has moved into an old property of mine, and while I personally couldn't care less, our wise and benevolent %rt has decreed that the owner of any structure infested by harpies is responsible for extermination. There is apparently a fine involved for noncompliance. Frankly, I don't have the time for this; but if you wouldn't mind bloodying your sword a bit, I could use your help. The last mercenary I hired didn't make it, so I would understand if you're hesitant. I'd be happy to pay you, say, _reward_ gold pieces for your trouble.","Would you? Marvelous. Now, the catch is that I must have proof that a serious effort has been made to clear out ___mondung_ in =2mondung_ days. Obviously that does not leave a lot of time. I had hoped that _contact_, the mercenary I had hired earlier from the Fighters Guild would have been more capable. And, listen, %pcf, you don't have to clear out all ___mondung_. Just kill four or five of the critters and get back here. I know! The clan leaders wear specially dyed gryphon's feathers. Bring back one of those and I'll have the proof I need. Just make certain you don't fail to return in =2mondung_ days, %pcf.","%oth. Well, I can't blame you. Never could abide the stench of harpies myself."
K0C30Y03#_qgiver_,male,"Ah, my friend. I regret to admit that I made a poor business decision, but facts are facts. I loaned a certain sum of money to a noble by the name of _patsy_, who you may or may not have heard of. The security on the loan was the deed to a valuable piece of property. Now _patsy_ and the deed have both vanished. Rumor has it that %g fell on some hard time financially, but the sum I loaned is not easily swallowed by my enterprises. Tangling with the likes of _patsy_ will likely be dangerous, but I need a champion. Will you help me, my friend, in exchange for a large uncut diamond?","That's good to hear. Now then, I have thirty days before I will be forced to dip into my capital. The deed was stolen out of a local establishment called _bank_ in __bank_ together with some other valuables, but the coincidence between _patsy_'s disappearance at the same time the deed did merits investigation. _patsy_'s old residence was _house2_ in __house2_, which I understand is now empty. Other than that, I have no leads. I either need the gold _patsy_ borrowed, the deed to the house, or that aristocrat's head on a stick in thirty days. Don't let me down, %pcf.","I am sorry to hear that. I understand, of course, but it is disappointing."
L0B00Y00#_qgiver_,male,"There is a traitor in the Brotherhood. You will perform the necessary accounting on this liability, will you not? // From time to time, the Brotherhood is forced to do an accounting in our own books. A traitor has been found within our order who must be settled. You have been selected to do the honors.","Very good. The traitor has taken refuge in ___mondun_ to the %di. If you have not returned in =queston_ days, your honor will be forfeit and another will take your place. Do not fail us in this, %pcf.",An ignoble reply. I expected better.
L0B00Y01#_qgiver_,male,"As you know, %pct, there is no room for failure in the Dark Brotherhood. Brothers who fail us are targeted for an accounting. You will find and correct one such errant former member. // It is a solemn duty, and not an entirely disagreeable one, to account agents of the Brotherhood who have failed us in an assignment. You are, I trust, free to take on such an assignment?","Very good, %pct. =target_, having learned something during %g3 tenure in the Brotherhood, has wisely hidden %g2-self, but we have a contact in __snitch_ of ___snitch_, a miserable =snitch_, a snitch named _snitch_. Talk to %g2 and get =target_'s location. I will expect the accounting to be accomplished, and you to be back here in =queston_ days.","Did I hear you correctly? %pct, I am grieved by your lack of cooperation with your brothers."
L0B00Y02#_qgiver_,random,"There is another assassination group budding in %reg, which must be crushed before it can bloom. I want you to move in, account the assassin, and then the man or woman who ordered the assassination. You do have time for this endeavor, yes? // The Dark Brotherhood has been the sole assassin's guild in Tamriel since the Second Era. We intend to keep that monopoly. There is a freelance assassin who has been flaunting us for some time, but =assassin_'s luck has ended. I want you to teach %g2 a permanent lesson, and then repeat the lesson for %g3 foolish employer.","Good. Now then, we know that the assassin, =assassin_, has pursued %g3 quarry to a dungeon called ___mondung_. If you have not found any clues to the employer's whereabouts, return here. I would, of course, prefer for you to account =assassin_ and %g3 employer both, but I'd be reasonably satisfied with merely the freelancer's death. Take no longer than =queston_ days for both accountings.",No? How strange and troubling.
L0B00Y03#_qgiver_,male,"The Mages Guild has come to us for a bit of messy business that's too gross and nasty for them to deal with. A renegade mage needs an accounting fast. Interested? // We have the Mages Guild for a client again. Seems that one of their boys has been sniffing too much bat gut, and has gone off on a rampage. Sound interesting, %pct?","Good. Now, this mage -- the name is =mage_ -- has absconded with a number of magic thingies but the Mages Guild doesn't mind if you take whatever %g has stolen. They just want %g2 dead. And you've only got =queston_ days to bring in the accounting. You'll find %g2 cowering down in a nasty place called ___mondung_. Get back here with the world minus one rogue mage in =queston_ days. Mephala steady your arm, %pct.",That's disappointing.
L0B10Y01#_questgiver_,random,"Here's a rather amusing accounting that may appeal to your morbid sense of humor. Seems there's this untalented bard with a penchant for rude limericks about former patrons. As it turns out, %g3 knowledge of genealogy was lacking, and %g sang a song about an incestuous duke to %g3 new patroness, the duke's daughter. Interested in accounting this uncouth artiste for _reward_ gold pieces?","I thought it would appeal. Apparently, the bard is aware of our contract and is hiding in a dismal hole called ___mondung_. Shouldn't be more than a minor scuffle, but do not let down your guard. A desperate songster can be an unpredictable adversary. Be back in =1stparton_ days to collect your accounting fee. Good luck.","Did I misunderstand you, or did you really say no? How do you expect to appreciate the rich tapestry of humanity if you don't have time to butcher a lousy musician?"
L0B10Y03#_qgiver_,male,"The Brotherhood prides itself on always knowing where each Brother is at all times. I could tell you where you were last Tirdas within a foot of dirt. One of our Brothers, however, has disappeared and while on assignment. You will attempt to find =target_, and, unless %g has suitable excuse for %g3 absence, you will account %g2. I trust you have time for this, yes? // As you know, no one ever leaves the Dark Brotherhood. One Brother has disappeared on assignment, and we must know if =target_ is dead or alive. You have been picked for this assignment.",Good. =target_ has a cousin in ___contact_ -- a =contact_ called _contact_ who generally can be found at a place called __contact_. Talk to %g2 -- firmly -- and find where %g3 cousin is. I'll give you =queston_ days to take care of this business and return.,"Truly? Well, I suppose you're entitled to refuse an occasional assignment."
L0B20Y02#_questgiver_,random,"Ah, here's something to appeal to the romantic in you, %pcf: a caddish knight has besmeared the honor of a fair damsel and refuses to fight any who would defend her. The poor girl did the only thing she could do, and now we have some accounting to do. You're interested, I take it?","As I thought. We think the knight does not yet know about the contract, being deeply entrenched in a fortress called ___mondung_. Obviously, this ill-bred warrior doesn't want to make this too easy on us. Well, the contract calls for the accounting to be in =1stparton_ days and for you to report back here within that time. Go to it, %pcf. Defend that poor soiled damsel.","No? I would have thought this would be your good cheer. Well, we have plenty more accounters with a soft spot for corrupted wenches."
L0B30Y03#_questgiver_,random,"I recognize your expression, %pcf. You are growing arrogant, egotistical, and vain. It's wonderful to see. Still, you need to exercise your humility and take on an assignment with dangerous political connotations. We have a contract on a high ranking member of the Mages Guild. Are you up for it?","You don't disappoint me, %pcf. Yes, we have been asked to account this wizard, who by the way is no sparkcaster. To make matters a little more interesting, this mage never leaves the Mages Guild -- so you must run the risk of disturbing several dozen of the best, most destructive spellcasters in the realm. You will find the sorcerer in the Mages Guild in ___mondung_. The contract is valid for =1stparton_ days, and then you must be back and this wizard must be dead. Fair luck to thee and may her infernal highness Mephala guide thy hand and foot.",Then strike that giddy grin from your face until you develop some bravery.
L0B30Y09#_questgiver_,random,"We have an anonymous job for you. It happens every now and then that someone pays us to remove someone, but never reveals why, or may even work though a go between to keep their identity secret. At any rate, the job is yours if you want it.","Go to _mondung_ of ___mondung_. Your target has a scar on the left cheek. That's all we know. Come back in =1stparton_ days to collect your payment. Mephala bless your blade, %pcn.",Can't blame you for not wanting to get mixed up in this one.
L0B40Y04#_questgiver_,random,"This little excursion is not for just anyone, but I feel you'd enjoy the challenge of the experience. We have a client who wants to call accounts on a member of the royal family of ___mondung_. When I heard that, I thought of you. Interested?","I just knew you could not resist this one. Fair warning, your target, _knight_ is no pampered princeling. The client is also one of the royal family, worried that _knight_ is going to worm a way to the throne. And from what I've heard, %g has the power to do just that. Our client wants %g2 extinct in =1stparton_ days. We will give you that time to account and return to make your report. May Mephala walk with you, %pcf.","Oh, well. Probably wise, but it does smack a little of ... dare I say, cowardice?"
L0B50Y11#_questgiver_,random,We have an interesting job available %pcn. A high ranking member of the Thieves Guild. This will be a tough one. Do you want it?,"You are a sharp one. The target's name is _marknpc_, here in ___questgiver_. %g moves around a lot and is usually protected by bodyguards. Be careful. You have seven days. When it is done, return here and I will pay you _gold_ gold. Ask for _questgiver_.",It's not for the faint of heart. // Understood. Come back when you are interested in real work.
L0B60Y10#_questgiver_,random,"This could be a tough one, even for you %pcf. It's one of the best fighters in all of %reg. Are you sure you want this job?","Somehow I thought you might try for this one. It's your funeral. This mark is no arena gladiator. We're talking about a veteran of the Betony war. Killed 9 men, if the stories are right. Go to _mondung_ in ___mondung_. You'll be able to identify the mark easily because of the limp. A spear in the knee during the war caused it. Get back here in =1stparton_ days.",Don't blame you a bit. This could be a bit too dangerous.
M0B00Y00#_questgiver_,male,"We've got a little job you might be interested in. Seems there's a loup -- whatcha call your basic werewolf, wereboar, or some kind 'o werebeasty that's been bothering a lot of farmers in the area, and we need someone to kill it. It'll mean _reward_ gold in your pocket. That sound interesting to you?","Great. You'll find the loup over in ___mondung_. We need the poor brute dead in =1stparton_ days, so you better be on your way, kid.",Fine. Guess someone else'll have to do it.
M0B00Y06#_qgiver_,male,I am _qgiver_. We have a request from a local citizen. It seems a wild animal has gotten into his place. We need someone to go kill the thing. The guild will pay _gold_ gold.

Come back here when the beast is dead and I'll have your pay waiting for you."" _qgiver_ calls out, ""Hey, what kind of animal is it in _house_?""",I'm sure someone else will be willing to take care of this nuisance bear.
M0B00Y07#_qgiver_,male,"Every once in a while we get an idiot like this client. Some fool left his back door open and a wild animal got in. He seems rather confused as to whether it is a bear or a tiger, but in either case, it wanted to eat him. We need you to go and slay the animal. Your standard fee is _gold_ gold. Want to take it %pcn?",Great. Go over to _house_ in __house_. I'll give you =2dung_ days to kill it and get back to me.,"Gotcha. Let the tiger have him. The guy is a fool for letting it in in the first place, eh?"
M0B00Y15#_qgiver_,male,"I am _qgiver_. I have a relatively menial job, if you are willing to take it. Actually, some members prefer these jobs because they pay just as well as the more difficult ones. A house here in town has infested by giant rodents. The wife claims they are rats, the husband claims they are bats. Either way, they want them gone. Are you interested?",The bats have infested _house_. Go there and kill them all and you'll get your pay. I can only give you one day to finish this one.,Obviously you have no love for the Fighter's Guild. I will make sure to tell them what you really think.
M0B00Y16#_questgiver_,male,"Howdy, %pcf. If you got a few days free, a job just came in for some giant-killin', and I thought of you. Interested?","Right. Seems there's this giant, moved into ___mondung_ a while back and has been having a fine old time feastin' on _dummy_'s sheep in the area. Ate a few of the local villagers too, I guess, but old _dummy_ don't seem so concerned about that. At any rate, %g wants this giant taken care of within =qtime_ days, and %g's payin' _gold_ gold for it. See ya in a bit.","Too busy, eh? When I was your age, I was never too busy to off a giant or two. Kids these days, I tell ya."
M0B00Y17#_questgiver_,male,"%pcn, isn't it? Just who I was looking for. We have a rather interesting job, requiring a bit of brains rather than brawn. Are you interested?","Here's the situation. Seems _dummy_ has this pet sabertooth tiger -- don't ask -- and it ran off a few days ago. %g had it tracked to ___mondung_, but now we need someone to go in there and bring it out. Alive. The trick is that it's been trained to respond to this bell. The tiger should become docile if you ring the bell in its face. Of course, _dummy_ did say it isn't trained too well -- are you surprised? -- so you may have to smack it upside the head once or twice to get its attention. Just don't kill it, OK? Bring it back to _dummy_ at __dummy_ in one piece within =qtime_ days, and %g'll pay you _gold_ gold. Good luck.","Yeah, you're right, I did say this job needed brains didn't I?"
M0B11Y18#_questgiver_,male,"%pcf, I have an important mission that will require the utmost discretion. I can't tell you more unless you agree to help me. What do you say?","An old friend of mine is in grave danger, and needs an escort who is handy with a blade and can keep a secret. Naturally, I thought of you. _target_ will meet you at 10:00 tonight at _targethouse_. %g will tell you more when you arrive. I would come with you, but since I am known as %g3 friend, I might lead %g3 enemies to %g2. Watch your back on this one.","%oth, I had expected much more of you."
M0B1XY01#_questgiver_,male,"I like you, kid. This assignment ain't for just anyone. Seems there's a flock of flyin' carnivores -- harpies -- who are making a bunch of travelling merchants real nervous. Will _reward_ gold get you over to ___mondung_ and a little hackin' 'n slashin'?","Okay then. There are five of these beauties in ___mondung_, and they all gotta be dead in =1stparton_ days or no deal. And a word of advice: you get back here in =1stparton_ days but get to ___mondung_ as soon as possible or those harpies are gonna migrate and you'll be outta luck. Okay kid, good luck and get outta here.",Too bad. Seemed pretty like a pretty damn generous deal to me.
M0B20Y02#_questgiver_,male,"Yeah, I got a little job for you. I wouldn't give this to just anyone, but I know you do good work. There's this pack of giants that want killing. Pay is pretty standard, _reward_ gold pieces. You up for it?","Good deal, %pcf. Our client places the giants at their stronghold, ___mondung_. He says there are six of 'em, and he ain't gonna pay unless all six are stiffed, and in =1stparton_ days. Got it, %pcf? Good.","Awright, whatever. Sounded like your kind of thing is all."
M0B21Y19#_questgiver_,male,"How are you, %pcf? If you need work, I've got somethin' for you. Standard protection job. Interested?","All right. The client's name is _victim_, over at _victimhouse_ just up the street from here. %g wants you over there right away.

M0B30Y03#_questgiver_,male,"Something's come up. I don't know who else could handle it but you, %pcf. There's this bad critter in ___mondung_, a Daedroth. Now, I ain't lying -- no one knows why it's there, but everyone wants it gone. For _reward_ gold, you think you could handle it, %pcf?","Hey, alright, your funeral, %pcf. Listen, knock off that Daedroth and get back here in =1stparton_ days for your reward. I don't know how long that thing's gonna be around, so you're gonna want to move your ass. And listen to me on this, %pcf -- go prepared for a hell of a fight.","I don't blame you, %pcf. I wouldn't wanna take on a Daedroth either."
M0B30Y04#_questgiver_,male,"Listen, %pcf, if you hadn't already done a bunch of jobs for us already, I wouldn't even suggest this, but there's a job I don't even want to tell you about. It sounds like crying for the moon, and more dangerous. It's offing a lich in ___mondung_. And it only pays _reward_ gold. You're not interested, are you?","Aw, I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it. Listen, if you're really gonna do this, get the best stuff you can get, magic stuff, ebony blades, what have you. This lich has to cross to Oblivion in =1stparton_ days, and you gotta be back here within that time to get your reward. You're unbelievable, %pcf. Good luck. You're gonna need it.",Thank %god you got a little sense left. We'll just let that lich do whatever the hell it wants to do. That's fine with me.
M0B30Y08#_qgiver_,male,"Bit of a rummy domestic squabble, %pcf. Seems that this woman in __house_ has asked that someone rid her place of her husband. The only problem is that he is dead. Are you willing to take this on?","Her husband is a zombie. He hides out somewhere during day. She never sees him in _house_ then. At night he wanders around the place. Put him out of his misery and get back here in =2dung_ days, and it's worth _gold_ gold to you.",Too bad. Normally only the temples get jobs like this. You've passed up a good one %pcn.
M0B40Y05#_qgiver_,male,Some woodsmen have hired the guild to kill a spriggan. Seems the monster is attacking them when they are out in the woods logging. Want to take a hack at it %pcn?,"Two attempted ambushes have failed. The spriggan is just too smart. You'll have to go to its lair, in ___dungeon_. Get back to me within =2dung_ days and I'll have _gold_ gold waiting for you.",Fair enough. Run along. I've got to find someone to take this job.
M0B50Y09#_qgiver_,male,"A certain merchant needs to have a monster, a gargoyle to be precise, dispatched. The pay is a modest _gold_ gold pieces. Can I have your help in this matter?",It seems this merchant hired a wizard to build him a grand mansion. Then the poor fool tried to cheat the mage of his wages. The wizard grew angry and animated one of the stone gargoyles on the new mansion. It has been attacking the merchant ceaselessly. Go out to ___dungeon_ and kill the thing. You've got =2dung_ days to complete the task.,"Hmmm. Not the brave, heroic sort I guess."
M0B60Y10#_qgiver_,male,"We have a new client who wants someone to hunt down an atronach, an elemental golem type critter. The pay is _gold_ gold. Are you interested?","A young dandy what I have sworn to keep unnamed, was screwing around with magic, illegally. Like a melonhead, he up and conjures an atronach.

M0C00Y11#_qgiver_,male,You can call me _qgiver_. Normally we only give jobs to guild members. But you show promise %pcn. I tell ya what. I got a request to dispose of a giant scorpion. Do that and I'll see if the guild will overlook your reputation. Is that a deal?,"You got guts %pcf, I'll give ya that. Apparently this scorpion escaped from someone's personal collection. Right now it's cornered in _house_. Kill the thing today and I'll speak well of you.",I try to be nice and look what it gets me. Just get outta here.
M0C00Y12#_qgiver_,male,"My name is _qgiver_. I don't like handing out jobs to non-guild members. You seem like the trustworthy sort though. Some poor soul brought home a giant spider's egg that hatched. Seems they mistook it for a silkworm cocoon. The poor slob can't afford to pay us to get rid of it. However, if you take care of it for free the guild looks good and I'll make sure you look good. Are you interested?",This is your shot at the big time. The spider is trapped in _house_. Kill it today and I'll put in a good word for you.,I should have known you were serious about work.

Go there and kill them all and I'll see what strings I can pull on your behalf. I can only give you one day.,Obviously you have no love for the Fighter's Guild. I will make sure to tell them what you really think.

N0B00Y06#_qgiver_,male,"%oth, is there anything more exasperating than the discovery that the mummy wrappings you were planning on using in a potion have gone all sort-of green? I could use the Guild's wrappings, but the recipe specifically calls for ""superlatively fresh mummy wrappings,"" whatever that means.

It'll be worth _gold_ gold to you. Now this mummy's tomb is not too far away at all, so it shouldn't take you any longer than =queston_ days to get there, make your grab, and get back. Remember, it's got to be fresh -- preferably off its body. The name of the place is something like ___mondung_. It's sure to be gruesome there. You might want to bring a sword or some such thing.

Oh yes, well, the secret to these boxes is that they are almost impossible to open in any way except by the use of the simple, standard Open spell. %g specifically made them resistant to the fancy alternative spells %g3 friends liked to use.

We require it before the day has dawned =1stparton_ times. ==other_ can be found in ___other_. Ask after _other_. Let the gods and spirits guide thy feet, %pcf.","Too employed art thou to do this task, even knowing its importance? Unfortunate for ==questgiver_, and unfortunate for thee, %pcn."
Q0C4XY04#_questgiver_,male,==questgiver_ must once again call on thy kindness and might. We require a heart of a daedra for our spellcraft but the heart must be recently plucked and by thou. Wilt thou find and murder a daedra for your dear aunts?,"The Goddess smiles on us, %pcn, for there is a dungeon near that has a daedric infestation. Any daedra heart will do but that of a Lord, for theirs is putrid with worms. Go thou to ___mondung_, %pcn, slay for us a daedra and bring it before the sun sets =1stparton_ days.","No? Oh, sorrowful night."
R0C10Y00#_questgiver_,random,"If you are available for hire, I need someone reliable to carry out a certain, covert mission. It might be rather time-consuming, but I assure you that you will be suitably compensated. Are you interested?","Very good. I'm giving you an emerald for you to give my contact, _npc1_ of ___npc1_. %g will be waiting in __npc1_. The item needs to be there in =1stparton_ days. That's very important. Once you've made it that far, _npc1_ will have further instructions. I am counting on your discretion, %pcf, and you will be watched. Good luck and thank you.","Really? Too busy, perhaps. That is a shame."
R0C10Y01#_questgiver_,male,"If you want work, I am looking for someone to take a special _item_ to an acquaintance of mine. The reward will be extremely liberal. Interested?","Excellent. Here's the _item_. Now, _contact_ needs to have it in ___contact_ in =queston_ days. That ought to be just enough time, I hope.

R0C10Y02#_questgiver_,random,"I need someone to bring an item to a contact of mine in ___contact_. You will receive an item in return. If you bring that item back to me, I will happy to reward you with _reward_ gold pieces. Do you agree?","Very good. Take this bar of gold and bring it to a certain =contact_ called _contact_ in a place called __contact_ in ___contact_. You will need to move quickly. If you are not at __contact_ in =1stparton_ days, _contact_ will leave, and none of us will be happy. Especially you. Very well, good luck to you, %pcf.",No? What a shame. I was prepared to be quite generous.
R0C10Y04#_questgiver_,random,The whining peasants who work my land near ___mondung_ have long complained about evil wizardry being practiced in that dungeon. It appears that this time they may be right. I am in need of an assassin with enough time to travel to ___mondung_ and destroy the necromantic sorcerer there. I am prepared to pay _reward_ gold pieces for this service. Are you interested?,"%oth, that's grand. I need to have this wizard extinguished in =1stparton_ days, so you will probably want to get on the road right away. Good luck, %pcf, and show no mercy.",Really? I would have thought this was your sort of an assignment. How inconvenient.
R0C10Y05#_questgiver_,random,"You may be aware that I am forming an alliance with _qgfriend_. To cement our friendship, I have agreed to arrange the death of a consistent threat to %g2 -- some sort of monster. This foul parasite lives in a decrepit old place called ___mondung_. %g has agreed to pay the creature's assassin _reward_ gold in return. Not too bad, I'm sure you'll agree. So, does this sound like your sort of an adventure, %pcn?","Recognize a good deal when you hear it, eh? I told _qgfriend_ that the monster would be dead in =1stparton_ days or %g could go out and hire someone else. So kill the creature and get over to ___qgfriend_ and find %g2 before the time runs out.",Really? How inconsiderate of you to leave me in the lurch like this.
R0C10Y06#_questgiver_,random,"I have a _item_ that's very precious to me. It's been handed down from generation to generation in my family. Knowing this, a small pack of orcish bandits have stolen it and are holding it for ransom. I have no intention of rewarding them for this outrage. On the other hand, I will pay the full amount of the ransom, _reward_ gold pieces to you if you would go to their holdout and steal the _item_ back. Will you?","Good. Now, I am given to understand that the orcs' hideout in in the old ___itemdung_. That's where, I suppose, they're keeping my _item_ as well. If you're not back in =1stparton_ days, I'll presume you haven't found the _item_, and will give your reward money to the orcs as ransom. Don't fail me on this, %pcf. Good luck.","%oth! You will not do this for me? Then I will have to pay the ransom. You disappoint me, %pcf."
R0C10Y08#_questgiver_,random,"If you could, %pcf, I am in need of assistance from someone I know isn't a complete buffoon. I sent another mercenary out to deliver a small package to a temple, nothing of great value, but damned if it wasn't stolen. Well, at least this idiotic hired hand paid attention to where the bandits went. Do you think you could help me out and get my parcel back?","Thank you in advance, %pcf. Now, the complications. The bandits sold the _item_ to a temple, _itemplace_ in __itemplace_. It apparently has some sort of religious significance to them. In order to avoid embarassment, I need you to steal the _item_ out of the temple and get it to _transporter_. You'll find %g2 at _inn_ in __inn_. The _item_ must be in the moronic _transporter_'s hands within =1stparton_ days; and you must be back here from __inn_ in =2ndparton_ days after that, understand? Not a lot of time. I'm counting on you, %pcf. Good luck and farewell.","%oth, I was afraid you were going to say that. Ah well, I suppose that is better than saying yes and failing."
R0C10Y09#_questgiver_,random,"Yes, I do have something for an able-bodied young %ra. It's nothing special -- just a simple errand, but it'll mean an extra _reward_ gold to you. Interested?","Good. I have a ... procurer in my employ. Distinctive looking, =spy_ going by the name of _spy_. Well, _spy_'s found a special _item_ of interest to me, but the former owners have %g2 trapped somewhere in __hidingplace_. My hands are tied officially, but you could kindly go to __hidingplace_, find _spy_, and bring me my _item_. Of course, if you're not back in =1stparton_ days, your _reward_ gold reward will have to be forfeit. I'm sure you understand. Well, you ought to be on your way. Goodbye.","%oth, I suppose you wanted me to give you _reward_ gold for nothing. Or perhaps you were hoping for something really interesting? Well, you'll have to wait for that, %pcf."
R0C10Y10#_questgiver_,random,"If you are interested in earning _reward_ gold for doing nothing more than delivering a little parcel to an agent of mine, speak up now. // I could use the services of someone of moderate talent, above average discretion, and willingness to assume the position of a lowly courier for _reward_ gold pieces. Are you that person?","Excellent. Here's the _weapon_. Now, _contact_ needs to have it in ___contact_ in =queston_ days. That ought to be just enough time, I hope.

R0C10Y11#_questgiver_,male,"You are not by any chance free to run a little errand for me? It's very simple, I would do it myself or have one of my runners take care of it, but we are all so very busy. It would mean an extra _reward_ gold pieces. That's not too bad. Are you available?","What luck. Now, take this _item_ and go to ___qgfriend_ to a place called __qgfriend_. There's an odd =qgfriend_ there named _qgfriend_. Give %g2 the _item_ and %g will give you the _reward_ gold. Oh, and you need to be there in =queston_ days, but that should not be a problem. You have sturdy young legs. Off with you, what.",No? %god save me from idle %ra hands.
R0C10Y12#_questgiver_,male,"Yes, this is a potentially awkward situation I'm in. Not the worst, but awkward indeed. I'm in possession of a certain ... item that is not, to be blunt, legally mine. If you would carry it to a contact of mine in ___contact_, you will be handsomely rewarded. Does _reward_ gold pieces sound fair to you?","You will help me? %god be praised. Now, hurry, take this _item_ and go to __contact_ in ___contact_. Look for a =contact_ named _contact_. Don't think about taking the _item_ elsewhere. If you're not in __contact_ in =queston_ days, _contact_ will come looking for you. Now, hurry, time is of the essence.","You abandon me in my hour of need, young %ra. I am sorely displeased."
R0C10Y13#_questgiver_,male,"I have a mission of some diplomatic importance. A gift of peace that needs be exchanged. As a favor to me, would you bring my gift to my friend, _contact_?","Very good, %pcf. Now, listen carefully: take this _item_ to the palace in __palace_ and find a =contact_. That will be _contact_. %g will be expecting you, and will likely reward you for your trouble. You'd best be on your way. Do not fail me, %pcf.","Is it the price, the inconvenience, or the lowliness of the mission that irks you, %pcf? No matter, I can easily find another %ra interested in furthering his political standing."
R0C10Y14#_questgiver_,male,Are you by any chance available for a little assignment that should not take you any time at all and will make you _reward_ gold pieces richer?,"%oth, that's grand. I have a rather dimwitted associate of mine who left on an assignment without %g3 _item_. I need it rushed to ___contact_ straight-away. There's a little place there called __contact_ where you can find a =contact_ named _contact_. Give %g2 the _item_ and %g will give you the _reward_ gold pieces. One final note, %g will be leaving __contact_ in =queston_ days with or without the _item_, so you'd best be on your way.",No? Pity.
R0C10Y15#_questgiver_,random,"I have a somewhat complicated mission that needs a fourth man involved. It might take a couple of days to accomplish, but it will mean an extra _reward_ gold in your pocket. Sound intriguing?","I have a contact in ___npc1_ who has a certain item needed by another associate of mine in ___npc2_. Of course, _npc1_, my contact in ___npc1_ needs to be paid for %g3 item. That is why I need you to bring this diamond as payment to _npc1_. The diamond needs to be in %g3 possession in =1stparton_ days. Once you have made it to __npc1_, _npc1_ will give you further instructions. Thank you, %pcf, and %god be with you.",That is a disappointment. Ah well.
R0C10Y17#_questgiver_,random,"I was wondering if you might do me a small favor. You see, I have a friend who requires a certain shipment of a certain substance brought by a certain time. I trust I'm making myself clear. Are you available for such an assignment, given a payment of, say, _reward_ gold pieces?","So, you are available. Well, that's grand, I must say. Now then, here's a whatsamajig, a _item1_. It needs to be brought to an alchemist I know by the name of _npc1_. You'll find %g2 at __npc1_ in ___npc1_. With luck, %g will have something for you to bring to my friend, _npc2_. Well, you best be off. _npc1_ told me %g needed the _item1_ in =1stparton_ days or less.

R0C10Y18#_questgiver_,random,"Are you free for a few days to do me a little favor, %pcf? I just need something I borrowed brought back to its owner. Nothing too strenuous, and you'll be _reward_ gold pieces richer. A tempting offer, eh?","%oth, that's the spirit! I have this _item1_ I borrowed from my good friend _npc1_, a priest in __npc1_ of ___npc1_. It's somewhat of a rush to get it back to %g2 -- %g needs it in =1stparton_ days. So please do hurry. Thank you for this, %pcf.","That's too bad. Well, I'll just hire someone else then."
R0C10Y20#_questgiver_,random,"How would you like to have a lovely _reward_ from my treasury, %pcf? My alchemist has ordered a very rare ingredient he needs for an important experiment and we need someone to pick it up. Do you think you could handle that, %pcf?","Excellent, %pcf, I knew you would be game. Take this _item1_ down to __contact_ in ___contact_. There's a =contact_ there by the name of _contact_. Ask %g2 to give you the _item2_ %g's brought up from the south. Make sure you're there and back in =1stparton_ days. All righty then, %pcf. I'm relying on you.

R0C10Y21#_questgiver_,random,"My cousin, _qgfriend_, has appealed to me for aid in a rather distasteful situation. It appears that there is a ... temple of some variety being consecrated, if that's the proper phrase for these disgusting orcish activities. Well, obviously, we need to crush it while it's budding. I am willing to go as high as _reward_ gold. Can I count on your help, %pcf?","Thank you in advance for this, %pcf. What I think would be the best use of your abilities is to infiltrate ___mondung_ and eliminate the so-called shaman of the temple. If we can kill it before our assault in =1stparton_ days that would make our job much easier. When the deed is done, report to my cousin's palace in ___qgfriend_. %g's the one who's going to pay you for all this.","What are you, some kind of orc-friend? %oth, get out of my sight!"

Are you willing to risk this, in reward for a generous fee?","You will? Then good luck to you. Here is the daedra's heart. If it is not in my friend _chemist_'s hands in =1stparton_ days, it will be too old to be used. After you have delivered it, return for your reward. Good luck and godspeed to ___chemist_.","I'm disappointed, but I can't say I don't understand.

I am given to understand %g has found something of interest to a mutual friend of ours, which needs to be delivered as well. So, here is the telescope. Take it to a =npc1_ in a place called __npc1_ in ___npc1_, and there you will get further instructions. Good luck to you, %pcf.","No? I wasn't expecting you to turn down _reward_ gold for a few days work. How many peasants would murder for that kind of money? Ah, well. Your life, I suppose."
R0C11Y19#_questgiver_,random,"I'm in rather a delicate situation, %pcf. If I could count on your diligence and your silence, you could earn yourself, say, _reward_ gold pieces profiting on my misery. Sound enticing?","Well, that's good anyway. Not long ago, during a time of financial stagnancy, I pawned a ring given to me by the Emperor himself. I figured that Uriel Septim never makes it down to this corner of the Empire, but now I hear his agents are in the area, and I must have to have that ring back. _contact_, of __contact_ in ___contact_, will only hold it for =1stparton_ more days.

The people of ____qgiver_ are becoming anxious about the lack of progress in the official investigations. The situation is becoming explosive, with people afraid that the Ripper is coming for them next. I fear that we will have a mob situation soon, perhaps within =total_ days or less. The only other person I've unofficially hired on this is _contact_, a local scholar who has been analyzing some of the letters I've been sent. Go to _bookstore_ to talk to %g2 first, and check on %g3 progress. If you cannnot solve this mystery, then %god help us all.","Not an uncommon response.

Princess Morgiah,female,"You're trying to track down that letter of the Emperor's, yes? There are very few scandals in the Bay of which I am totally ignorant. I could give you some information, but nothing is without a price, that I know well. I need a champion who doesn't fear the fire of Oblivion. Are you interested?","%oth, that is a relief to me. Do not ask any questions -- get this letter to a certain high level sorcerer at the Necromancers' crypt, Scourg Barrow in the Dragontail Mountains. Avoid the rift. If you see it, you have gone too far. They will not be expecting you and will not wait for any introductions. The necromancers feel that death is a reward for the living, not a punishment. Once you have delivered the letter, they would feel no need to guarantee your safety. It is their way. I need the letter delivered and a response from _necs_ in my hand one month from now at the absolute latest. The risks are very high, %pcf, please do not fail.","Pity.

I would know of her condition, but few possess the bravery to face the horrors of her castle and speak with her. My reward for a report on her health is a magical _magicitem_. Will you be my champion in this?","%oth, I am glad to have found a champion. The name of her castle is Shedungent, and it should not take you longer than =2shedungent_ days to go there and return.

Lady Brisienna,female,"%pcf, I'm glad you could meet me here. The Blades and your emperor need you again. You may or may not be aware that the Totem of Tiber Septim has been found. For a brief time Lord Woodborne of Wayrest had it. Where he got it from is still a mystery. The Blades mounted an assault upon Woodborne Hall to retrieve it. Although the Hall fell, many of our number fell with it. We sacked the Woodborne Hall, but the Totem was gone. I have reason to believe that Gothryd has the Totem. The Blades no longer have the men to mount an assault on Castle Daggerfall. You have shown yourself to be quite adept at getting in and out of these places. Would go into Castle Daggerfall and retrieve the Totem of Tiber Septim?","I knew I could count on you %pcf. The Totem is most likely in the Daggerfall treasury. It is a huge room, quite unmistakable. I am leaving in a couple of days. I shall send word to you where you can meet me after you get the Totem. Should you succeed, the Emperor has instructed me to gift you with an artifact of great power and renown. _artifact4_!","These are dark times indeed. If Gothryd gets the Mantella as well, Tamriel will be thrown into a civil war."

A totem pole or something? Well, an acquaintance of mine, a perfectly delightful =contact_, has something that may help you. If you would escort my cousin _foil_ to _contact_ you can have it. Would you do this teensy weensy favor for me?","How exciting! It will be a real adventure. _foil_ just loves to travel and has been dying to spend some time with _contact_. Go to ___contact_ of ____contact_, to a place called __contact_. %g will pay you =reward_ gold pieces for bringing %g2 _foil_. Don't you just love these dangerous missions?",No? How dreadful! My poor cousin will be so disappointed. You are not nearly as fun as Lord Woodborne said you would be.
S0000010#_agentuk_,random,"Good day, %pcf. My name is _agentuk_. I must admit that I am surprised to see you. Are you perhaps able to help the Underking in an endeavor against the Necromancers? We will reward you liberally for this service, and provide information you will probably not be able to find elsewhere.","You will. Hmm. Remarkable. The Necromancers have taken an item of ours, a _reward_ of some value. The value is of secondary concern. The true problem is that they cursed this item and gave it to the Blades. If you are unaware, the Blades were once the honor guard for Tiber Septim. Today they are loyal to the empire and Tiber's code, but not always to the current emperor. The Underking has reason to not wish harm upon the Blades. We want you to infiltrate Castle Llugwych in Ykalon and remove the _reward_. Please have this done in =itemindung_ days if you want your information and reward.",No. I see. Very well.
Queen Barenziah,female,"Thank you for responding to my letter, %pcf. It is very difficult for a queen of a powerful nation, and a queen whose home is far away, to trust any mercenary. That is why when my dear child Helseth told me about you, I was so quick to write. There is a rather sensitive situation brewing, and I need someone I can trust to correct some wayward revolutionaries. For _reward_ gold pieces, will you perform such a service for me? I am also prepared to reward you with information as well as _reward_ gold.","I am glad to hear it. Some years ago, a disgruntled, and possibly deranged, scribe of mine wrote a biography of me which my worst enemy would call cruel and defamatory. Because the book was also excessively critical of the Empire and Septim Imperial family, it was wisely suppressed and its author executed. Unfortunately, chapters of the book resurface from time to time. I have reason to believe one chapter of the book has been purchased by the orcs of Orsinium, who are attempting to publish it. I need it removed from their stronghold, also named Orsinium. Time is of the essence. I'm sure Gortwog will not wait long. Once the chapter is safe, we will talk further about your ambitions.","That is a pity indeed. Prince Helseth is usually correct in his assessment of people, but it would appear that he is wrong in this matter."
Mynisera,female,"Hello %pcn. I have heard much about you. Now you come to me with a very interesting tale of deception. So Cyndassa the maid says that Aubk-i opened a letter from the emperor addressed to me. I can tell you %pcf, that she never delivered such a letter to me. I would like you to investigate this further, %pcn. It could be dangerous to poke into the affairs of Aubk-i without enraging King Gothryd, even though he is my own son. Are you willing?","Good. I have long had my suspicions about Aubk-i's loyalty to the emperor. She is a daughter of the late King Camaron, who ruled Hammerfell from his citadel in Sentinel. My husband King Lysandus, %god rest his soul, died at Cryngaine, as did King Camaron. Lysandus' body was not recovered, so he has a monument erected there rather than a true tomb. Ah...my mind wanders. The emperor uses _messenger_ as his messenger in Daggerfall. %g could be anywhere in the region delivering missives. However, _messenger_ is a member of the Knights of the Dragon. Go to _location_ in __location_ and ask for _dispatcher_. %g may know where to find _messenger_. Try to find out why a letter addressed to me was delivered to Aubk-i.","Aubk-i must have you tightly wound around her finger, %pcn. I hope you survive to benefit from her patronage."
Queen Aubk-i,female,"%pcf, I do not know even how to broach this subject. I need you to promise me on your ancestors' honor that you will do what you can to help me and never breathe of what I say or what you see to anyone else anywhere. Will you so swear?","I will trust you then, %pcf. The matter concerns my mother-in-law, the dowager queen of Daggerfall and widow of Lysandus, Mynisera. As mistress of the household finances, I have noticed that she has been paying for the upkeep of a fortress called ___myndung_ complete with a large platoon of soldiers. A short while ago, she disappeared with a wrapped parcel of papers and came back days later with empty hands. She has recently left again with another parcel of letters and my spies have verified that she has gone to ___myndung_. You will have to trust that my suspicion of her activities is justifiable, for I am not in a position to offer proof. What I need for you to do is go to ___myndung_ and find that parcel of letters or any other information about her activities there. Mynisera will be returning in =2myndung_ days. You cannot have any more time than that, I fear. Good luck.","It would be worse, I suppose, for you to swear and then not be true. Still, I had hoped for more gallantry from you."
Queen Akorithi,female,"%pcn! Welcome to Sentinel. I trust you have had a comfortable stay so far. Let me get right to the point. My son, Prince Lhotun, says you are a well respected and trusted %ra. I have need of your sort. I am willing to pay you _gold_ gold to infiltrate Castle Wayrest and recover an heirloom of the late King Lysandus for me. Will you do it?","What Bounty! There is an item, a painting, that is hidden somewhere within Castle Wayrest. I desire this item for reasons you need not worry about. Bring it to me and I will pay your _gold_ gold.",Hmmm. I shall have to rethink your standing in this court.
Mynisera,female,So Morgiah says Gortwog has the emperor's letter. Very interesting. I think I have a way to get Gortwog to turn over that letter. Are you willing to brave the depths of Orsinium to try to retrieve it?,Gortwog wants very badly to be recognized by the empire. It would mean the beginning of peace between the orcs and the other races of the empire. Present this letter to Gortwog. Hopefully it will persuade him to cooperate.,You are obviously not as loyal to the empire as I thought. Be gone.
King of Worms,male,"%pcf, I am so glad you answered my letter. I hope my messenger was gentle. You have been a loyal servant in the past. Not as loyal as my living dead, but far more versatile. My need involves the lowest depths of Castle Sentinel, and the reward is knowledge that only the dead can provide. Are you willing?","How amusing. I am looking for the answer to a question. It doesn't exist among the living, but may exist among the dead. I want you to bring me back the ghost of Prince Karolis, the great grandfather of the late King Camaron of Sentinel. Karolis was a sorcerer of no mean skill. He is now a lich deep in the bowels of the Castle. I am giving you a special _scarab_. If it is close to him when you destroy his physical body, his soul will be trapped in the _scarab_. Bring it back to me, and I will tell you a tale few mortals have heard.",You must have strong sentiments for Queen Akorithi. What a pity.
T0C00Y00#_qgfriend_,random,"You dare summon forth Azura of the Crimson Gate, pleading for power? I don't know if you are worthy of such favor. In fact, I doubt it very much. I suppose that if I demanded that you murder a priest who has been saying very, very rude things about me, you would refuse even that small, simple request. Would you do that for me?","You would! Oh jolly good. Well, this perfectly awful priest is also a Healer, if that means anything. Isn't that just typical? As usual with these self-righteous types, =monster_ is secluded in ___mondung_, cleansing or some such ridiculous thing. Anyway, why don't you hop on over there and stick a sword in %g2 or something. And then scurry over to ___qgfriend_ and see my dear darling _qgfriend_ who will give you my Star. That's enough power for anyone. I think =1stparton_ days is time enough for this, don't you? Oh, good. Hurry along then, %pcf. And don't be a stranger. Say hi to _qgfriend_ for me. Okay, 'bye.","No! You're supposed to say yes! You're supposed to say: Yes, beautiful Azura, I would gladly murder at the snap of your ivory fingers. Boor! Bigot! Barbarian! Now, I must go before I forget that I am a lady and say something that I'll regret ..."
U0C00Y00#_questgiver_,random,"Power, hah! Would a Mundus-crawling %ra know what to do with real power? You mean you want to be able to bully a few other mortals around, don't you? Well that can be arranged. I want you to show me you have the mettle to actually use what I give you. Will you kill someone for it?","Well, that's a start in the right direction, anyhow. The spellsword I have in mind for you to butcher for power is =monster_, a perfectly charming and charitable ass who's been annoying the hell out me for years. You will find %g2 at %g3 fortress, a place called ___mondung_. Now, don't think that just because =monster_ is a precious toff, %g doesn't know how to fight. I want to make you work a little for this gift. After the murder, go meet _qgfriend_, my agent in ___qgfriend_. Just look for a =qgfriend_ hanging out at __qgfriend_. And don't keep %g2 waiting. I'll tell %g2 you'll be there in =1stparton_ days. That ought to be plenty of time. I'll be watching.","Pah, you make me sick. Don't summon me again, %pcf, unless you grow up or are looking for a fight."
V0C00Y00#_contact_,random,"My needs are rather ... modest, but my offer, I think you will agree, is altruism and generosity indissoluble. In return for _artifact_, an artifact of great power, I only ask that you exterminate a nasty little bit of fur that has been preying on some of my friends who live near ___mondung_. Lupines are generally quite friendly with me and my associates, but this one ... well, kids will be kids. Do we understand one another?","Ah, recognize a good deal, do you? You will find the lupine menace somewhere in a place called ___mondung_. Unfortunately, time is not our friend in this matter. For reasons too dull to discuss, I need the oaf dead in =1stparton_ days. After you have murdered the creature, meet my friend at __contact_ in ___contact_. Just look for a =contact_. Nice doing business with you, %pcn. I'm sure we'll meet again.","Why, you nauseating insect. You poison the air with your thickwitted insolence. How dare you summon forth the greatest of the Princes of Oblivion and refuse the simplest request I could possibly propose? In return for water, I offer you wine and you spit both in my face. I will not forget this, %pcn."
W0C00Y00#_questgiver_,random,"Power, yes, is an allusive but eloquent prosecution. One of my minions possesses an ancient tome called the Oghma Infinium, which bequeaths great power on those who read its pages. If you exterminate a certain scrofulous patrician who has aroused my displeasure, I will arrange a meeting between you and the book. Is this agreeable?","Very well. This socialite I referred to resides at the palace of __palace_. For the record, the name of your quarry is _enemy_. Kill %g2 and proceed to ___contact_, where my servant _contact_ will wait for you in a library. I do not think there is anything to be gained by continuing this interview. Fail me not in this, %pcf, and the power thou craves will be thine.","You answer negatively. Am I to understand that you sought power, but seek it for free? You ought to have sought wisdom instead, for that is what you need. I bid you a very disappointed goodbye."
X0C00Y00#_contact_,random,"If you would not mind doing a small favor for me, I can put in your possession a most excellent reward, _artifact_. I have a child, apparently miserable with all the blessings I have given him, who needs ... what is the euphemism? To be taught a lesson? A very serious lesson. Does this sound like an agreeable contract, %pct?","Ah, good. This child of mine is a wereboar who has made his den in a place called ___mondung_. You should have no trouble finding it. After you have put him out of his obvious misery, which should not take more than =1stparton_ days, go to a place called __contact_ in ___contact_ and look for a person named _contact_. If you arrive there within =1stparton_ days from now with the wereboar dead, %g will give you _artifact_. A pleasure doing business with you, %pct. Good luck and farewell.","I am gravely disappointed, %pct. // Seldom am I summoned, even rarer are the occasions when I am free to answer a summoning. To be perfectly blunt, this was a waste of my very precious time."
Y0C00Y00#_contact_,random,"So you want power? Yes, many covet power, yes, but so few know why. Want you _artifact_? Is very special, _artifact_. Very nice, yes yes. Just, do one thing, and you have it, mmmm. Child have I that needs to be punished, yes. You will do this for lovely, lovely _artifact_, yes?","Mmm, Mortalcreature brave, good good. Now, go to ___mondung_, kill frost daedra there. It thinks safe, ha, we slaughter frostflesh tight and everywhere. You kill it and go =contact_, %g2 _contact_ in __tavern_. Got good good _artifact_ for you. Kill frost daedra and see _contact_ before =1stparton_ Mundal nights. Go now, %pcn. Dagon waits.","Scruh! Mortalcreature say no to Mehrunes Dagon! Mortalcreature know you time means nothing to Dagon, he remembers insult, yes. Hamita too black for Mortalcreature, no, I ... will ... remember %pcn."
