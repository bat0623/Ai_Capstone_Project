(SPOILER) After completing the Shivering Isles DLC, the Hero basically mantles Sheogorath, whereupon the concept of gender becomes irrelevant as Daedric Princes are technically genderless and can assume whichever form they want.

As a Knight of the Nine, the Hero will be stripped of all holy relics should they gain enough Infamy (i.e. more than two points), and must go on another pilgrimage to be absolved of their sins in order to wear them again.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner
../data/ElderScrolls/Oblivion/,The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion,The Champion of Cyrodiil,The Champion of Cyrodiil,Badass Normal,1," [Badass Normal](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal): Comes over as this compared the player characters from *Morrowind* and *Skyrim*. The player character from *Morrowind* is the Nerevarine, the reincarnation of an ancient legendary general, while the player character from *Skyrim* is the Dragonborn, a mortal with access to the reality warping ancient language of the dragons. The only peculiarity this character has, is that they happen to be at the right place at the right time to meet the emperor and set in motion the chain of events leading to the defeat of Mehrunes Dagon. Apart from this, there is nothing setting them apart from other people. However, this does not stop them from marching into Oblivion and killing hordes of Daedra.  (SPOILER) They subvert this trope after [becoming the new Daedric Prince of Madness](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpoweredBadassNormal). ",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal

You're not able to regenerate Magicka, but you start out with 50% Spell Absorption.

(SPOILER) Ultimately pointless once they become the new Sheogorath, since a Daedric Lord can be all of those things, even at once (and Sheogorath is nutty enough to do that last part; Sheogorath's character uses a male Breton asset during their cameo in *Skyrim*).

-   Humorously, you can become a member of the vampire hunting [Order of the Virtuous Blood](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePiratesWhoDontDoAnything) even if you're a vampire yourself.
-   If you join the Mages Guild and fight Necromancers, you can still engage in necromancy yourself, such as creating black soul gems.
-   You can undertake a quest to raid a den of skooma traders, [and then steal their skooma and sell it yourself](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero).
-   Most notoriously, a journal entry at the end of the quest ""Unfriendly Competition"" mentions that it was fitting justice for you to kill a grave robber as grave robbing is punishable by death. [Graves are regularly encountered as loot sources in various dungeons. By the point you've finished that quest you've likely robbed hundreds of graves yourself](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia).</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite

-   In the *Fighter's Stronghold* [DLC](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC), Castle Battlehorn is bequeathed to the Champion after defeating its would-be invaders. Lord Kelvyn, the previous owner, had sold most of the Castle's wealth to pay for its upkeep, with his will explicitly stating that he hoped that the Champion would refurbish the Castle back to its former glory.
-   Similarly, the *Wizard's Tower DLC* has [Frostcrag Spire](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MageTower) being bequeathed to the Champion by a distant relative. Since it's mostly unfurnished, they're required to bring the tower back up to snuff.<!--* TheLancer: Uniquely enough for an Elder Scrolls Protagonist, they play this role to Martin.--></ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician
../data/ElderScrolls/Oblivion/,The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion,The Champion of Cyrodiil,The Champion of Cyrodiil,Loss of Identity,0," [Loss of Identity](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfIdentity): An ambiguous case.  (SPOILER) The Champion's appearance as the new Sheogorath in *Skyrim* shows they've assumed the appearance and mannerisms of the previous mad god, but their dialogue implies that they remember their old life, and their shenanigans are noticeably more benevolent than the old Sheogorath's. It's equally plausible that their behaviour as Sheogorath is [a total act](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheMask), because a [crazy performance](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity) is simply what people are expecting.

They really are just some random schmuck who happened to be in the right place at the right time to cross paths with the Emperor just before he was assassinated and ended up getting put on a quest to save Tamriel from Oblivion.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightManInTheWrongPlace

(SPOILER) References in *Skyrim* suggest the Champion may have joined both the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild; despite that, they still get hailed as a hero and rewarded with near god-like power.

There's no reason why you can't go around punching everyone you see, and still save the world. And the Dark Brotherhood quest line is very much intended to let the player be a villain.

While the out of universe explanation is simply due to Bethesda making mistakes, the in universe explanations are unclear. For specifics:<ul>
-   The alleged circumstances of his birth don't seem to match up with other information about him or his physical appearance. He is implied in an in-game book to be the bastard son of the Camoran Usurper and his Bosmer mistress, born around the time of the former's death. This would put his birth year at 3E 267. However, he is shown to be an Altmer, despite interracial hybrids in the series have long since been established to take after the race of their mothers, and his commentaries are said to be contemporary with Tiber Septim, who died in 3E 38, further muddying the waters. However, in Legends, his card is categorized as both Altmer and Bosmer, but since both of his parents were Bosmer, this implies he was able to somehow completely change his race at one point. Out of game, the reason for this is likely because the developers simply selected the wrong race when making his model.
-   Camoran notes in his Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes that in an anecdotal case, three days after learning a new language, he could ""speak fire"". This, combined with his seeming ability to wear the Amulet of Kings, heavily implies that he is one of the Dragonborn himself.
-   While you're in Paradise, he'll give you a [Hannibal Lecture](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HannibalLecture) that claims a *very* different cosmology to the one generally presented in lore. Is he right and the Aedra are liars  (SPOILER) squatting on Lorkhan's Daedric Realm , lying to throw you off balance (in-character, given the whole deal with [Paradise](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsntHeaven)), or just a [Know-Nothing Know-It-All](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll) (his mixing up planes of Oblivion is an admitted out-of-universe mistake by the writer, but <img class=""ymmv1 rounded"" src=""/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png"" title=""This example contains a YMMV entry.
