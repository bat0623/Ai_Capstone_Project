class="dialogue character"><p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> Greetings Gwynbleidd.</p></div><div class="indent"><div class="choice"> <span>What is Philippa doing in Vergen?</span></div><div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> What could Philippa want? Why does she care about Vergen being free, independent?<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> Like all sorceresses, she likes to dabble in politics. Not one of them would hesitate to sacrifice another life if it furthered their goals.<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Quite a one-sided opinion. All, none. Life's rather colorful, it's not all black and white.<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> Hm, shades of gray, I think. I have no illusions about mages. You know the fate which the Queen of the Valley of Flowers reserved for the elven youth? Enid an Gleanna, known also as Francesca Findabair, another sorceress. In exchange for the creation of an elven kingdom in Dol Blathanna, she sent the Scoia'tael to be butchered. While attacking Nilfgaard's foes from the rear. She had a chance to call it off - she could have opposed the Emperor of Nilfgaard and summoned the Squirrels to defend the Valley of Flowers.<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Why didn't she?<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> In the name of a higher purpose. It's what the emperor wanted. That's why we became bandits after the war. That's why elves are dying, our young murdered by the likes of Roche. And that's why I cannot trust Philippa Eilhart.</div><div class="choice"> <span>Roche might be on the other side of the mist.</span></div><div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Roche could be on the other side of the fog.<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> In that case, I'll finally get him. I came close in Flotsam.</div><div class="choice"> <span>Have you been hunting him long?</span></div><div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Been after him for a while?<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> Ever since he became leader of the Blue Stripes. During his first mission as commander, he ambushed one of my units, cut it down to the last elf. Surprised me for the first and last time. I've been more cautious since then.</div><div class="indent"><div class="choice"> <span>Is that when you swore revenge?</span></div><div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> So it's a personal matter. Vengeance - a theme straight out of Dandelion's ballads.<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> The safety of the Scoia'tael demands his death. Of the commanders first appointed to such units, he's the only one still alive.<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I noticed there's no Temerian emblem in your collection.<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> We should not claim something's done when it is not.</div></div><div class="choice"> <span>Even when he's gone, there will be others.</span></div><div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You do realize that a dozen others will replace him when he's gone? Possibly dirtier foes, possibly worse.<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> Better to have a known enemy, you say? That doesn't apply to Vernon. A more determined demon has never walked upon this earth. The longer he is active, the better he gets. I must put an end to it.</div><div class="choice"> <span>Are there many like him?</span></div><div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Are units like the Blue Stripes common?<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> The Blue Stripes are uncommon, let me assure you. Efficient, ruthless and well led - they're your version of the Scoia'tael. But you're right, there are other units. Each kingdom has a few of them, smaller or larger. They were a reaction to our operations behind the lines during the wars with Nilfgaard.<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> These units recruit only those who have nothing left to lose. They're persuaded it's all for a greater good and are spoon-fed dreams of revenge for the death of their loved ones. They gradually lose any vestige of humanity, kill when ordered to without hesitation. Of course, the same happens to regular soldiers, only these special units actually enjoy hunting elves.</div><div class="indent"><div class="choice"> <span>It's a vicious circle.</span></div><div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> They come after you, though you're similar, in fact. This provokes you to retaliate, and so on... And that'll continue until only a few are left, all on one side.<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> I have no illusions which side that will be. You, the dh'oine, will conquer this world with your thoughtless expansion. We are dying out.<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> So why fight it?<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> Elves stand by their decisions. Unlike you, we don't flit between alternatives. We made a choice once - now we reap the results.</div><div class="choice"> <span>Just like the Scoia'tael enjoy hunting dh'oine.</span></div><div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You're a lot alike, your Scoia'tael and them. You've turned into the same killing machines.<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> Said a witcher.<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Precisely why I know what I'm talking about. I've been stripped of the capacity to experience pleasure from killing. When they made me, someone knew what they were doing.<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> I doubt anyone knows these days. But thank you for your harsh words. They say the truth heals.<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Many a poison can cure - provided the dose is small enough.</div></div><div class="choice"> <span>Why are you fighting for Saskia?</span></div><div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Tell me about this dh'oine for whom the Scoia'tael are ready to do battle.<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> Saskia? She's no dh'oine. Certainly not like the others. You've seen her. I doubt I need to explain.<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> She's fighting for a Pontar Valley for dwarves, elves and humans alike. I thought you despised humans.<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> I may only be a warrior, but I'm no fool. This is the best we can hope for, now. And it's better than the Valley of Flowers.</div><div class="indent"><div class="choice"> <span>Ever been to the Valley of Flowers?</span></div><div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Have you ever been to the Valley of Flowers?<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> Dol Blathanna is nothing more than a vassal state of the Nilfgaardian emperor. They call it the land of free elves, but the Scoia'tael are not welcome. It's another in a string of painful lessons... but a free Pontar Valley could change that.<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> It's been five years since the kingdom was established in Dol Blathanna. Over two thousand elves have settled there. Do you know how many children they've produced? A dozen or so. It's no longer the Valley of Flowers - it's the valley of sterile elders.<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'd love to see you tell Francesca that.</div><div class="choice"> <span>Think we can win this war?</span></div><div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You think you can repel Henselt's army?<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> No.<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> What do you mean, no?<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> The fortifications and dwarven devices are simply not enough to hold off the Kaedwenis. They are just too many.<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> What do you plan to do?<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> You'll see. One thing I can promise - I won't break any pledge I've made.</div><div class="choice"> <span>I once knew another Scoia'tael - Yaevinn.</span></div><div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I once met another Scoia'tael leader.<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> Yaevinn. I knew him. He had beautiful dreams and desperately wanted me to share them. Asked the same of you, I heard.<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You know a lot about me.<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> I try to know as much as I can - about everyone.</div><div class="indent"><div class="choice"> <span>[If no Witcher 1 save is imported, or if Geralt didn't side with the elves]</span></div><div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I'm a witcher, I remain neutral. I didn't take his side.<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> Perhaps that is the correct attitude. Let things run their course. It's worse if we then wonder what could have been had we acted differently.<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I try to avoid that. Decisions should be evaluated before they're made, not after.</div><div class="choice"> <span>[If a Witcher 1 save is imported where Geralt sided with Yaevinn]</span></div><div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> I helped him - I found his reasons just.<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> Because they are. But they're equally unrealistic. Yaevinn saw combat and killing as poetry. Whereas war is prose, with no place for beauty.</div></div><div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> How is it that we're on the same side today?<p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Things change. Today I have different goals and different allies.</div></div><div class="choice"> <span>Any ideas where Letho might be?</span></div><div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> Anything new about Letho?<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> No, but I wager he's somewhere on the other side of the fog. I can feel it.</div><div class="indent"><div class="choice"> <span>Why did you decide to work with Letho?</span></div><div class="dialogue"><p><span class="tag">GERALT:</span> You haven't had a chance to explain yourself - your alliance with Letho. This is a good time.<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> I suppose I owe it to you, Geralt. I don't know who they are, exactly, nor who they're working for. I met Letho two months ago. He had escaped his pursuers in Aedirn, found me, and suggested we trade services.<p><span class="tag">IORVETH:</span> Our scouts and forest hideaways in exchange for the heads of Foltest and Henselt. A good offer to begin with that only became better when we revealed only part of our secrets. It then turned out that Letho was not alone. Serrit and Auckes were meant to kill Henselt, my warriors were to help them. As you know, this never came to pass.</div></div></div></section><hr><footer><p><a href="#top" id="back-to-top">Back to top</a></p><p class="text-small text-grey-dk-100 mb-0">Document © Laurelnose.
