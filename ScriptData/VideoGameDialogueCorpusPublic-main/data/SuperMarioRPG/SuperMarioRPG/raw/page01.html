1.0 (5/31/2004)  - first release

____________
Introduction\_________________________________________________________________
 
Basically, I'm making this stuff up on request of some board members of the
SMRPG forum in GameFAQs. This would be just the written record of all the
unskippable dialogue and actions of the characters in the game. Provided that
there is demand for it, this article will also include other miscellaneous
chat which you wouldn't normally encounter in the game, and can only be
accessed by doing something special (or stupid). That's pretty much it. If you
think I've missed out on something and you know what it is, kindly let me know
and I will do the necessary corrections.

Now, that was quick and easy, on with the scripts!

___________

Here they are:

______________________________________________________________________________
Scene: Toadstool picking up flowers in Mario's garden. Suddenly, the skies
turn black and Bowser kidnaps the Princess.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toadstool: HELP!

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario comes out and goes after them. He arrives at Bowser's Keep just after
Bowser went in through the top entrance. After battling some Terrapin guards
and crossing a couple of bridges over hot lava, he reaches the throne room.
Mario looks around and was surprised to see the Princess tied up above him.
Bowser is on one of the chandeliers supported by a Kinklink, and Mario jumps
on the other one. They battle.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toadstool: Don't let Bowser bruise you, Mario!

Bowser   : Mario! Prepare yourself for the great beyond!

Toadstool: Mario! The chain! Aim for the chain!

______________________________________________________________________________
After hitting the chain enough, the Kinklink looks like it can't hold on
any longer.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Bowser   : What was that sound?

           N...n...NO!!!

           It's a chain reaction!! Hang on, Kinklink!!

______________________________________________________________________________
The Kinklink lets go, and the chandelier Bowser's standing on falls.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Bowser   : Eyaaaaa!!

           Coming, Mario?

______________________________________________________________________________
Bowser throws a Hammer to Mario's Kinklink.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toadstool: Fight, Mario! FIGHT!!!

______________________________________________________________________________
The chandelier stabilizes.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Bowser   : This should FINISH you!

______________________________________________________________________________
Bowser throws another hammer, and this time the chandelier falls. Mario falls
and catches up to the same height as Bowser.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Bowser   : Mwa ha! Did you think I was just gonna GIVE her to ya?

           You're ALWAYS in my way! This is IT! I'm gonna take you out, Mario!

______________________________________________________________________________
Bowser moves forward to slash Mario, but the latter just jumped on top of him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Bowser   : Fungah! Foiled again!

______________________________________________________________________________
Bowser falls a long way down, while Mario jumps back to the Princess.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toadstool: Oh, Mario! You had me so worried. Let's get out of here!

______________________________________________________________________________
Suddenly, the castle trembles from some unknown force.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toadstool: Shriek!! Mario!! I'm going to fall!

______________________________________________________________________________
Cinematic: Behind the clouds, a star breaks up and a colossal sword falls down
on Bowser's Keep. Afterwards, the words &quot;SUPER MARIO RPG&quot; form on the screen.

The pieces of the broken star, seven in all, scatter all over the place, with
the last one falling on the castle.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

______________________________________________________________________________
Scene: The World Map overview. A small Mario sprite is shown flying from
Bowser's Keep and lands on the PipeHouse. Outside, Toad watches him land and
rushes in the house.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toad     : Hey Mario! Lots of people use something called a &quot;door&quot; to go in
           and out of their houses... Anyway, I came by to pick up Toadstool,
           since she's a bit late.

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario jumps out from the wall he hung on and heads outside.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toad     : Hey I thought the princess was here with you, Mario! So where is she?

           Mario, what's with the silent treatment?!
           You're not telling me something.

           It's Bowser again, isn't it? Oh no, here we go again!
           Mario, would you please bring her back, like you always do?

______________________________________________________________________________
Scene: Mario goes over to Bowser's Keep, but the giant sword stops him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Exor     : Halt! Who goes there? A trespasser!

           This castle now belongs to us, the &quot;Smithy Gang&quot;. It's our first
           step towards taking over this world! And if it weren't for nosey
           characters like YOU...

           We'd practically own this world! So let's see you deal with this!

______________________________________________________________________________
The sword creates a quake and the bridge towards Bowser's Keep was demolished.
Mario returns to his Pad.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toad     : You're back so soon! Did you forget something?

           No? What happened then?

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario demonstrates what happened.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toad     : The bridge to Bowser's Keep is out now? Just wonderful...

           We must inform the Chancellor of Mushroom Kingdom at once!
           Let's go, Mario.

______________________________________________________________________________
Toad goes out, and so does Mario, but before he could access the outside
world, Toad returns and knocks Mario back, doing 1 HP damage.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toad     : Oops, excuse me!

           ..Oh?
           That bump on your head reduced your &quot;HP&quot; level. One of Mushroom
           Kingdom's famous items ought to perk you right up!

           [Received a &quot;Mushroom&quot;!]
           
           Do you know how to use items?
              
           :: (I have no idea)
           
           &lt;insert item tutorial here&gt;

           :: (Of course I do!)
           
           Oh, I see.
           You're just so well-traveled and experienced, Mario!

Toad     : Uh, now why did I rush back? I had... something to tell you.

______________________________________________________________________________
A lone Goomba comes in and calls Toad's attention.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toad     : Ack, I remember!
           I came to warn you that Mushroom Way is swarming with monsters!

           I just barely made it back here in one piece! Mario, please do
           something.

           Perhaps I can help.
           Do you know about &quot;Timed Hits&quot;?

           :: (No)

           &lt;insert timed hit tutorial here&gt;

           :: (Yes)

           Hey, you better watch out! He knows about Timed Hits.

           He's gonna punch your lights out!

______________________________________________________________________________
Goomba walks out.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toadn    : He's got more bark than bite, huh?

           Uh, now why did I rush back? I had... something to tell you.

           That's right! We need to tell the Chancellor about Toadstool!
           I'll see you over at Mushroom Kingdom. Just in case, take these
           with you.

           [Received three &quot;Mushrooms&quot;!]

-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯



Toad     : Phew, my life was flashing before my eyes for a second there.
           Here's a little something in return.

           [Received a &quot;Honey Syrup&quot;]

Toad     : Boy that was a close call. Here's a token of my appreciation.

           [Received a &quot;Flower Tab&quot;]

______________________________________________________________________________
Scene: Mario meets the Hammer Brothers. They're holding Toad hostage.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Hammer Brother: HEY! Are YOU lookin' at me? My hammer and I don't like you!

Toad     : Mario! You better be careful. He's definitely got a mean streak!

Hammer Brother: Now ya got my hammer angry! Ya shouldn't have done that!

______________________________________________________________________________
They battle. Mario wins.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toad     : Thanks, Mario! I was running so fast I wasn't watching where I was
           going!

           Mushroom Kingdom's just ahead. We're almost there, Mario.

           Hey! Where did this hammer come from?

           Hmm.... Hey, do you know what THIS is?!

           It has the Hammer Bro's insignia on it.
           No one stands a chance against you when you whomp them with this.

           [You never know! It might come in handy!]

           [Picked up a &quot;Hammer&quot;!]

           Let's get a move on!
           I'll see you in Mushroom Kingdom.

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario enters the castle and meets Toad.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toad      : Mario, there you are! I'll tell the chancellor you're here.
            I'll wait for you down the hallway.

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario proceeds to the throne room.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toad      : Sir, Mario has arrived!

Chancellor: Mario! Thank goodness you're here!

            We heard an explosion or something at Bowser's Keep. It was so loud
            I almost dropped my spores!!!

            Uh...excuse me? W...where's the Princess? She departed for your
            house HOURS ago...!

            I fear the worst! Could Bowser somehow be behind all of this?

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario demonstrates what happened, up to the part where Bowser kidnaps
Princess Toadstool.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Chancellor: Spores alive!!! You're telling us that Bowser has abducted the
            Princess AGAIN?

            Nevermind. It will be up to you to enter the keep and rescue
            Princess Toadstool!

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario continues the story.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Chancellor: Egad! The keep is unassailable?! What awful power is at work here?!

            Mario...her life is in your hands. Please, save our dear Princess!

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario was about to leave, but the Chancellor calls him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Chancellor: Mario! I almost forgot!

            This may not help you, but...
            Why don't you take it along!

            [Got a &quot;Map&quot;!]

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario sets off, but just as he was walking downstairs, the Chancellor calls
him again, causing him to trip and tumble.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Chancellor: Mario! Forgive me.
            But I can't stop worrying about the Princess...

            Go to the cellar and prepare for your journey. The Vault Guard shall
            assist you.

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario proceeds to the cellar.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Vault Guard: Mario!
             The Chancellor has filled me in! Come. Let me show you around.

______________________________________________________________________________
They enter the treasure room.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Vault Guard: Help yourself to the treasures!
             ________________________________
             &gt;&gt; Mario takes the large coin &gt;&gt;
             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
             This is a &quot;Coin&quot;. The small ones are worth one, and the large 
             ones are worth ten.
             This one's a &quot;10&quot;!
             ____________________________
             &gt;&gt; Mario takes the flower &gt;&gt;
             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
             This is a &quot;Flower&quot;. The more you gather, the more Flower Points
             you'll have in battle. Find 'em!
             _______________________________________
             &gt;&gt; Mario takes the recovery mushroom &gt;&gt;
             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
             THIS mushroom will restore your Hit Points and Flower Points.
             Unfortunately, mushrooms you find as items only restore your HP.
             So beware.

______________________________________________________________________________
Scene: Mario walks out of the castle. Outside, he witnesses someone chasing
a thief.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mallow   : Come back here!!

______________________________________________________________________________
The thief shakes Mallow off his tail.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mallow   : Oh, no! That REPTILE stole my Grandpa's coin!

           B...boo hoo...sniffle... I can't cry. Big boys don't cry. But it's
           just not fair...!

           What am I gonna do? Waaaaaah!!!

______________________________________________________________________________
Mallow starts to cry, and at the same time, rain falls. Mario talks to Mallow
and tries to comfort him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mallow   : Y, yes? ...Gee, you're soaking wet, aren't you?
           _______________
           The rain stops.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           I'm all right now. Sorry... There's nothing like a good cry!
           But, why was I crying?
           There was SOME reason...

           My Grandpa asked me to buy some things for him here. When I walked
           into town, that croc stopped me!

           Oh yeah! He took it from me! He stole my coin! I chased him, but
           he's way too fast...

Jump Girl: Mario! Let's see how you're going to take care of Bowser!
           ____________________________________________
           Mario shows his jump, and Mallow is shocked.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Wow! He doesn't stand a chance!

Mallow   : Wow! You're THE Mario! I know all about you! You've got more JUMP in
           you than a box of frogs!

           I'm Mallow from Tadpole Pond. I'm a frog, but can you believe it? I
           can't jump. Embarassing huh?

           How about it, Mario! Will you help me catch that filthy thief?

           :: (Sure thing)

           [The young frog, Mallow, who doesn't look AT ALL like a frog, joins
            Mario in his quest.]

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario and Mallow was about to give chase to the thief, but the guard at the
exit stopped them to tell them something.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Retainer : Mario! I have something to report, sir.

           I saw him! He's here somewhere! He just zoomed past me a second ago.
           Did you see him?

Mallow   : Did he look something ...like...this?

Retainer : Why, yes! Exactly!

Mallow   : He's the one who took my coin! Why didn't you stop him?

Retainer : Because I forgot my bazooka at home! Sheesh... Give me a break, here.

______________________________________________________________________________
Somebody cries a theft, and Croco enters the scene.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Croco    : Har, har! Youse mugs'll NEVER catch me! A snail could outrun YOU
           morons! Later!

Mallow   : That's HIMMMMM! Hurry, Mario, let's get him!



-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯

-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯



Mallow   : There he is! He probably stashed it in that bag. Let's nab him!

Croco    : Are you trying to tail me? Go on home to mommy before you get hurt,
           kid!

           You couldn't jump to save your life, kid, so I guess this is
           goodbye!

           Oh! You're a persistent bugger! But I'm a 100 miles ahead of ya!

           Give it UP already! That treasure box is tempting, but now is not
           the time.

           Dead end! And they won't give up...! I'll just have to hide!

Mallow   : He's gone into hiding.
           Let's see if we can sneak up behind and catch him.

           _______________________________________
           &gt;&gt; If you fail to catch him properly &gt;&gt;
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Croco    : What's this? You fools couldn't chase down a pumpkin!
           ___________________________________________
           &gt;&gt; If it is the first time you catch him &gt;&gt;
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Croco    : Ha! Your eyes are much faster than your feet!
           At this rate it'll take ya......
           100 more years to catch me!

           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Croco    : You AGAIN? This is getting old!
           It'll STILL take you........

______________________________________________________________________________
Mallow comes out and confronts him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Croco    : Enough! Ya got me fair and square.
           I'll give you back your coin!

           Whoa! Did ya really believe me? I was...... LYING!!!

______________________________________________________________________________
They battle.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mallow   : Gimme back my coin or I'll belt ya again!

______________________________________________________________________________
Mallow punches Croco and retakes the stolen coin.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Croco    : Oooouch!!! I'm gonna pay ya back in spades, kid!

           Go on! Take back your grubby old coin!

           Adios amigos!

Mallow   : All right! We got it back!

______________________________________________________________________________
Croco leaves. Mario's party wins.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mallow   : Yeah, we did it! We got Grandpa's coin back.

           I can finish my errand now.

           Hey, look at this! That Croco guy left a wallet!

           [Found a &quot;Wallet&quot;]

           I'm going back to the shop at Mushroom Kingdom. Are you coming?

______________________________________________________________________________
Scene: Mushroom Kingdom is overrun by Shysters. Mario saves the townspeople
and secures the royalty, but learns that the Chancellor is still stuck in the
throne room. Mario comes in to investigate what's keeping him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Shyster 1: Where do ya think everyone went?

Shyster 4: Well, gang, looks like we have ourselves a new home!

Shyster 6: We can bounce around all day long! And there's no one here who can
           stand in our way!

Shyster 5: Yahoo! Let's bounce the night away!

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario approaches them.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Shyster 5: NOT SO FAST, PAL!

Shyster 6: Look at him! Can't even bounce! Hey, maybe we could bounce ON HIS
           HEAD!!!!

______________________________________________________________________________
Shyster 5 and Shyster 6 bounce together on Mario's head. Then, the camera
moves forward and reveals the Chancellor hiding in a corner, the boss named
Mack, and a blue star floating behind him. Mack jumps forward.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mack:    : Listen up, gang!
           These guys are gonna put a stop to OUR party!
           Are we happy about this?!

Shyster 1: You're asking for IT!

Shyster 3: Ooh, you're gonna get it!

Shyster 4: You picked the WRONG people not to bounce with, bub!

Shyster 2: How 'bout a fat lip to go with that ugly mustache?!

______________________________________________________________________________
They battle. Mario and Mallow wins.

Cinematic: The blue star rises up and spins around Mario, landing on his
hands. The party now has the first Star Piece.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Shyster 5: This is not good!

Shyster 6: This is not good!

Shyster 5: The mustachioed one is strong!

Shyster 6: Strong, YES!

Shyster 5: We MUST warn the boss!

Shyster 6: Come on!!

______________________________________________________________________________
The two surviving Shysters move out. Mario talks to the Chancellor.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Chancellor: Gracious!
            OH! It's YOU, Mario. What a relief!

            Once again, Mario to the rescue!

            But who WERE those...

Toad      : Chancellor!

______________________________________________________________________________
Toad and some Retainers enter the room.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toad      : Sir! Thank goodness you're all right!
            Mario! So it was YOU who got us through all of this! We owe much
            to you...!

______________________________________________________________________________
Scene: Later, Mario is discussing matters with the Chancellor.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Chancellor: First the Princess and now THIS! It's just too much to bear.

Mallow    : Mario! How about we ask my Grandpa for help?...
            He knows...EVERYTHING!

Chancellor: Excuse me, but... who are YOU?

Mallow    : Oh, hello! My name is Mallow. I'm from Tadpole Pond...

Chancellor: Well, any friend of Mario's is welcome here in Mushroom Kingdom.

            As I was saying, Mario, you are our only hope!

            Mario! Please! You MUST rescue the Princess, NOW!

Mallow    : Mario! I'm in your debt, too.
            Let's head over to Grandpa's place in Tadpole Pond. He can help!

            Wait...
            Why did I even come to Mushroom Kingdom in the first place?
            Guess I'll find out soon enough.

______________________________________________________________________________
Before they go to the Kero Sewers, Mallow passes by the Item Shop to finish
the first half of his job.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Manager  : Hey, Mallow! What kept you? I was starting to worry.

Mallow   : Hey, mister!
           I got my coin back!

Manager  : Oh! Well DONE, lad! Okay, here's the thing I promised you...

           There! Make sure it doesn't get eaten, or... whatever! Your Grandpa
           needs it, okay?

           [Got a &quot;Cricket Pie&quot;!]

Mallow   : You bet!
           Mario, thank you so much!
           Grandpa will be delighted!

-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯



Mallow   : This is the entrance.
           Grandpa says to watch out for &quot;Belome,&quot; whoever that is!

           It's probably a little dark down there, so keep alert!

______________________________________________________________________________
Mallow and Mario goes through the sewers. In the end they meet Belome.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mallow   : T...this must be... ... BELOME!

           Is that a fire hose or his tongue?!

Belome   : Moh, ho, ho...!
           Ack! It's a snack attack! And YOU'RE it!

______________________________________________________________________________
They battle.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Belome   : Stick for a body, head full of straw, give me a scarecrow, rah,
           rah, RAH!

______________________________________________________________________________
Belome turns one of your party members into a scarecrow.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Belome   : C...can't s...stand it! The hunger...the HUNGER!

______________________________________________________________________________
Belome moves in and swallows Mallow. After you deal enough damage, he spits
him out.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mallow   : That was SCARY!

Belome   : If you defeat me, you STILL won't beat me! Beware the flood!

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario and Mallow wins. The green switch Belome's been sitting on has been
released, and the metal gate has opened.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mallow   : Belome must have been lying when he said water would come gushing
           out of here...

           Er, Mario...do you hear something? ...Or is it just me?

           WATER!!
           Here it comes!!!
           Quick, Mario! Hit the button before we're washed away!!

______________________________________________________________________________
They both try to stop the flow, with Mallow stepping on the switch, but he is
too light to keep it down. The water washes them out to Midas River.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

______________________________________________________________________________
Nothing of much importance here, it's just a couple of mini-games where Mario
has to collect as many coins as he can. Toad gives a crash course about it.

Tadpole  : Hi! Can I help you?

           Mallow, it's you!

           We've heard all about your adventures with Super Mario.
           You guys beat up Belome, right?

Mallow   : You know about that?

           See Mario, the waterways of the world bring news to us here.

           That's why Grandpa knows all the news that's fit to hear!

Tadpole  : Are you really THE Super Mario?

           Hey everybody! You'll never guess who's here!

______________________________________________________________________________
All the other tadpoles surface and see Mario.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Tadpole x: He's the real thing! But he doesn't look anything like I thought
           he would...

Tadpole y: They DO say he can jump better than a froggie. I wonder if it's only
           a rumor?

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario jumps. The tadpoles are delighted.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Frogfucius: Well, grasshopper... What's new?

______________________________________________________________________________
All of the tadpoles dive back into the water.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mallow    : Grandpa! Mario's been helping me!

Frogfucius: I know, child.
            That rainstorm we just had... that was YOU wasn't it?

Mallow    : (Ouch!)

Frogfucius: (Watch it, up there!)

            (You're SUPPOSED to make me look like I'm FLOATING here, okay?!)

______________________________________________________________________________
Frogfucius &quot;floats&quot; forward, when in fact he's supported by a string.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Frogfucius: Welcome!
            So you are Mario, yes? I am Frogfucius.

            You have come to seek wisdom from me, have you not? I've been
            waiting for you!

            Yes, &quot;Old Wise People&quot; can often give good advice...

            But how rude of me! Let's get more comfortable. Come along and
            we'll talk.

            (Clear! Full reverse!)

            Tadpoles! Don't just FLOAT there! Make yourselves useful!
            Form a bridge for Mario.

______________________________________________________________________________
Frogfucius returns to his home. Mario follows him over the tadpole bridge.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Frogfucius: Yes, come into my sanctuary and partake of my wisdom, children.

            Let's see...

            That Smithy character that appeared at Bowser's Keep... He is quite
            formidable, yes?

            And, Mario, you wish to rescue the princess quickly, do you not?

            But, oh! If only you knew the truth!
            Toadstool is no longer there!

______________________________________________________________________________
Silence. Then Mario comes closer to hear more.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Frogfucius: Patience, young one.
            Let me explain. Here is what happened...

            You were rescuing Toadstool from Bowser's Keep.

            After defeating him, and JUST when you were about to free the
            princess...
 
            You heard a loud &quot;crash&quot;, and saw a huge sword split the sky!

            Whoosh, out of the blue!

            The shock sent the three of you flying.

            Bowser and Toadstool are still lost, somewhere out there.
            Now...

            You're worried about the princess, but first you need to take care
            of Smithy.

            His underlings are wreaking havoc in our world!

            &quot;Mack&quot;, whom you defeated at Mushroom Kingdom, was one of them.
            More will be coming.

Mallow    : Grandpa, I almost forgot to tell ya something!
            We found a star in the castle of Mushroom Kingdom. Do you know why
            it was there?

Frogfucius: A star, eh... ...most interesting.

            This may sound illogical, but I believe shooting stars can grant
            wishes...

            And now more than ever, I believe they will play a vital role in
            the fight against Smithy.

            Was that too much to absorb? Would you like a recap?

            :: (Sure)

            Okay, here's the gist of it! Smithy invaded our world and took over
            Bowser's Keep. Toadstool and Bowser were thrown by the impact, and
            now Smithy and his cohorts are now on a rampage. The shooting stars
            are somehow connected to this disturbance and they're the key to
            defeating Smithy.

            :: (Nope)

            It's quite a situation we have on our hands, isn't it?

Mallow    : Wow, everything sounds so dire and serious.

            I guess Mack was only the first of many, Mario. Some of them'll
            make Bowser seem NICE.

Frogfucius: Mallow, you speak as if these things do not concern you.

            You will accompany Mario in his adventure, too.

Mallow    : Grandpa! What are you talking about?

            I'm only a simple tadpole. This adventure isn't for me!

Frogfucius: Mallow, my boy, I've kept this from you until now,
            but you're...

            Not a tadpole!!!

Everybody : Say WHAT???

______________________________________________________________________________
Everybody else suddenly comes in and listens to the Frogfucius' revelation.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Frogfucius: I was sitting here one rainy day, enjoying a snack of crickets...

            When I happened to see a basket floating down from the falls.

            I peeked inside, and saw a little baby staring right back at me!
            The name &quot;Mallow&quot; was written on his belt. I felt sorry for the
            little bundle of puff and took him in to raise as my own
            grandchild. He had powerful magic, and I knew he was more than a
            piece of fluff. I thought,&quot;Surely, this child must be from some
            far off land.&quot;

Mallow    : Grandpa... You mean, I'm not...a tadpole?

            Sniffle...
                        sniffle...
                                     sniffle...

______________________________________________________________________________
Frogfucius stomps the ground and sends everybody back to their own business.
Mallow stops crying, although Frogfucius looks like he himself is crying, too.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Frogfucius: Mallow!
            Now is not the time to cry!

            Go with Mario on his adventure and find your real family.

            Your real mother and father are out there, somewhere.

            (Psst, Mario)

            The boy's magic is sure to come in handy on your adventure. You'll
            take him along, yes?

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario nods assent.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mallow    : Grandpa!

            I won't cry anymore. I'll go on this adventure with Mario and find
            my real family!

Frogfucius: Then it is settled. You must embark on your adventure immediately.

            First, go to &quot;Rose Town&quot; where they need your help.

_________________________________
&gt;&gt; If you have the Cricket Pie &gt;&gt;
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Frogfucius: (Snif) It will be quiet around here with Mallow gone.
            Maybe a snack will cheer me up.

            That's right! I had forgotten all about it.

            I will give you something for the Cricket Pie you brought back.

            ....Ah, I know! You shall have the staff I used when I was
            Mallow's age.

            The &quot;Froggie Stick&quot; will come in handy.
            Do not forget to equip it.

            Go to &quot;Rose Town&quot; now, Mallow. Luck be with you!

           Show me! PROVE IT!

Mario    : (jump)

           All right!!
           Hey Mario, wanna play with me? I'm playing &quot;Save the world!&quot;

           :: (Wrong number!)

           Awwww, you're a fake.
           Well, you'll have to do...
           Let's play my... &quot;Geno&quot; game!

Mom      : Now, Gaz...! Mario might be a little tired, dear.

Gaz      : Awwww, come on, mom! YOU never play with me!... It's no fun playing
           alone.

Mom      : Oh dear...Mario, I hate to ask, but... Could you play with Gaz for
           a little while?

Mom      : Yes, dear. That's nice, dear... And isn't Geno the one who broke
           my lamp the other day?

Gaz      : Awww, ma, that was just, well, you know... Now THIS WAS REAL!

           I SWEAR, Mom, REALLY! It's true! I SAW HIM outside!

Mom      : All right, Gaz, let's hear it! What are you trying to get out of
           this time, hmmm?

Gaz      : Mom, I didn't DO anything. I really, TRULY saw Geno walking into

Bowyer   : Happy I am, nya! Look...LOOK at their expressions when freeze
           they do!

           That Star Piece belongs to everyone. You can't keep it.

Bowyer   : Nya! NYA! Angry I am!

           Nya! A lesson I will teach you!

???      : Thanks for the help. You really got me out of a jam.

           Why are you staring at me? You know I'm more than just a doll,
           don't you?

           Have you guessed the truth? I'm a visitor from above, and this is
           a form I'm borrowing briefly.

Mallow   : You mean, like, from the sky or something?

???      : Higher than that, I'm afraid!
           Do you two know anything about the &quot;Star Road&quot;?
           _____________________________
           Mario and Mallow both say no.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Completely in the dark, eh? Well, it's a big mess up there right
           now, and it concerns you too!

           Let me explain...

           You've heard of wishing upon a shooting star?

           At the &quot;Star Road&quot;, your wish is transformed into a star.
           When it's granted, it then turns into a shooting star and falls
           down to earth.

           So you see, the Star Road plays an integral role in granting wishes.

           But ever since a sword destroyed the &quot;Star Road&quot;, everything's come
           to a halt.

           No stars have been made since.
           The way things stand, yours is a world where wishes can't come true
           anymore.

Mallow   : Are you saying THIS star is a part of your &quot;Starway&quot;?

???      : That's &quot;STAR ROAD&quot;, my fluffy little friend ...

           Yes, that star is a broken piece of the Star Road.

           I'm here to find them all, and repair the Star Road.

           The broken Star Pieces...
           There are 7 altogether.

           For peace to return...
           we must get rid of Smithy, find the Star Pieces, and repair the
           Star Road...

           I'm &quot;[heart][note]!?&quot;, but it's hard to pronounce so...
           Call me &quot;Geno&quot;, after the doll.

           I chose him because he looked the strongest out of all the dolls.

           Now grab the star, Mario!

______________________________________________________________________________
Cinematic: The green star rises up and spins around Mario, landing on his
hands. The party now has the second Star Piece.

Geno     : Come on! Let's get this show on the road.

           [&quot;Geno&quot;, who is searching for the pieces of the Star Road, joins
            Mario and Mallow. Things are definitely looking up!]

Aero     : Ooh, I heard everything! Who would have known that star was so
           important?

Gaz      : Geno! You came back!
           Mommy!

           SEE, Mom? THIS is the Geno I was talking about!

Mom      : My, my, what a fabulous costume! It must be kind of hot for the
           person wearing it, though.

Gaz      : Awww, forget it, mom.
           All right, Geno, let's play!

Geno     : How I wish I could! But Mario and I must leave now to find...
           ... the missing Star Pieces ...

Gaz      : Star Pieces? You mean like shooting stars? What for?

Geno     : Well... How can I explain this...

           Well Gaz,... it's like this... (demo: wishes come true)
           This is how it used to be,
           but now...it's like... THIS!   (demo: wishes no longer come true)
           Do you get it?

Gaz      : Uh uh... NOPE!
           You lost me.

Geno     : Well, let's just say that if things stay the way they are, your
           wishes will never come true.

Gaz      : WHAT?! So you mean even if I grow up, I won't ever be strong and
           cool like you?!

Geno     : No one's wishes will come true until the Star Pieces are found and
           the Star Road repaired. Which is why I have chosen to join these
           two in order to find the missing Star Pieces.

Gaz      : So that's it......! Well, Mario needs all the help he can get!

           Geno, I have a lot of dreams! Please, go fix the Star Road and make
           sure they all come true!

Geno     : That's a promise!

Gaz      : COOL!!

           Oh, wait! Wait a minute!

           This is yours, Geno, so take it along with you.

           [Got a &quot;Finger Shot&quot;!]

Geno     : Thanks for being such a good sport, Gaz. I'll see you when I get
           back.

Miner 2  : See that up there? That's the old entrance to the mines...

Miner 1  : ... But we can't reach it anymore!

Miners   : Mario, have you heard the news?

           :: (News? What news?)

           Well, Dyna took her l'il brother into the mines so they could play...

           And then, a HUGE star crashed into the mountain causing a big
           cave-in! Now they're trapped inside.

           And now, their daddy, who went lookin' for 'em, is trapped, too!

           Mario, will you help rescue them?

           :: (Of course)

Behind them, the star piece sinks to the ground.

Geno     : I guess my question's just been answered...

Ma'Mole  : I wonder how those kids're doing? Sure wish they'd hurry home!

Pa'Mole  : Settle down, woman!
           I asked Mario to help us out, so I reckon he'll bring 'em back when
           he's good 'n ready!

Ma'Mole  : I just have this odd feeling that they'll be dropping in on us any
           minute now...

Pa'Mole  : They still gotta use the door like everyone else, Ma. Now settle
           down!

The mine cart the party and the moles were riding crashes into the house.

Dyna     : We're home!

Ma'Mole  : Gracious! They really DID drop in on us!

           Oh, my poor babies! Are you okay?
           Little Mite, are you hurt?!

Dyna     : Naw, we're okay Ma. Isn't that right, Mite? We had FUN!

Mite     : Ma-ma! Pa-pa!

Ma'Mole  : He's been knocked senseless! You poor baby, you're safe now.

           Dyna! Haven't I told you often enough, to never go into the mines
           by yourself?!

Pa'Mole  : That's enough, Ma. Just be happy to have 'em back!
           We haven't thanked Mario proper, either.

Ma'Mole  : I'm so embarrassed!
           Mario, we can't thank you enough for everythin'.

           What's that? The roof, you say? Naw, that don't matter none, right
           Pa?

Pa'Mole  : It ain't nothing at all! You just leave any repairs to me. Give me
           a holler if you ever need a hand with your place!

           Thanks again for bringing our babies back to us.

Scene: Just as Mario and his party comes out of the house, he sees a trio of
Snifits chasing a beetle.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Snifit 1 : Come back Mr. Beetle! Don't you want to come to Booster's and play?

Snifit 2 : Yeah, don't run away! We just want to play! We'll take good care
           of you...

Snifit 3 : Uh...like... what they said, okay, Mr. Beetle?

______________________________________________________________________________
The beetle lands on his head.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Snifit 1 : Don't you DARE touch that beetle! It's a present for Booster.

Snifit 2 : That's right! Just hand it over, nice and easy.

Snifit 3 : Uh... Yeah...like they said... Or we won't be your friend.

Snifit 1 : Booster really, really, REALLY likes beetles! But he can't catch
           his own.

Snifit 2 : That's right, he's busy keeping the princess from the sky
           entertained.

Snifit 3 : So we're catching beetles for him.

Snifit 1 : So hand it over! 

Snifit 2 : That's right!

Snifit 3 : Uh... ......Pretty please?

______________________________________________________________________________
The beetle takes off.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Snifit 1 : Oh no! It's getting away!

Snifit 2 : Quick, catch it!

Snifit 3 : CATCH IT!

______________________________________________________________________________
The Snifits leave Mario alone. The party visits Booster Tower to see if the
Princess is there.

Bowser   : Booster has such a nice place... I miss my fortress...

           I miss the good old days...
           Toadstool screaming in terror, Mario rushing in to save her...

______________________________________________________________________________
Bowser turns around, crying. He was surprised to see Mario's party standing
behind him and watching.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Bowser   : Oh geez, it's Mario!

           Oops.. Okay, okay.. Calm down! Don't let him see you like this!

           &quot;Hey, how have you been?&quot;

           NO! Not like that, dummy!
           Wrong tone! It needs more... confidence!

______________________________________________________________________________
This time, Bowser addresses them with the right tune.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Bowser   : YOU!! What're YOU doing HERE?!

           If... Toadstool were at my castle waiting to be rescued...
           She'd be crying like a baby!

______________________________________________________________________________
The camera zooms towards the top of the tower, where Toadstool is shown
held captive.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toadstool: Oh? Did I just hear some voices? It couldn't be...!

           I can't believe it! It's...Mario!

           Mario~!!! I'm up here!

Bowser   : ... That voice! It's Toadstool!

           I thought she got away, but she's been stuck HERE... Mwa, ha, ha!

           Well... I guess I'll be returning to my castle now.

           Outta my way, shortie!

______________________________________________________________________________
Back down, Mario tries to open the door, but to no avail. Just as he was about
to leave, Bowser comes in and offers his help.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Bowser   : What!? You're STILL here?

           That look on your face...
           Mwa, ha, ha! I get it now!

______________________________________________________________________________
Bowser knocks the door open by bumping his shell.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Bowser   : Yeah... I'm a piece of work, ain't I?!

           All this power, AND looks too! I know, I know, You're thinking,
           &quot;A big strong guy like him would be great to have along!&quot; right?
           I'm gonna do something I may regret later...!

           I'll let you join the &quot;Koopa Troop&quot;. You can thank me later...

           [Mario and his friends have joined the &quot;Koopa Troop&quot;!]
           [(Or so they're pretending)]

           [&quot;Bowser&quot; joins the group]

______________________________________________________________________________
Somewhere up the tower, Booster meets the party aboard his toy train.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Booster  : What's the big rush?

           I'm Booster and this is my famous tower of amusement.
           Normally I welcome visitors to play with me and my Snifits.

           However, a girl fell out of the sky and into my lap, recently.

           Since then, I've been busy keeping her happy and entertained.

           I no longer have the time to play. So please enjoy yourself... at
           your own risk, that is!

______________________________________________________________________________
Higher up, the party encounters Booster once again.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Booster  : Chug-a-chug-a!

           Hoouuuooo! Chugga, chugga...hoooonk! This is my personal railway.

           Eh...?

           My! It's you again!

           I'm amazed you made it this far. Yes, quite amazing you are!

           Since you're here, maybe you could clear up something for me.

           My bride-to-be is chanting, &quot;MARIOHELPMEMARIOHELPME&quot;. Is she showing
           her happiness?

           Hey, wait a second! Maybe &quot;MARIO&quot; is another guy!

           What if you're this &quot;Mario&quot; she keeps talking about?
           Trying to take my bride away? Why don't you take THIS, instead!
           ________________________________________________________________
           &gt;&gt; If Mario evades/kills all the bombs Booster throws at him &gt;&gt;
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           That didn't do it?

           Grrrr...I ran out of bombs.

           Well, so long!
           _____________________________
           &gt;&gt; If Mario exits the room &gt;&gt;
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           HE'S GONE?! That's not fair!

           I'm so hurt... I only wanted to play with him.

           Now, ....what expression should I be wearing at a time like this?!
           ____________________________
           Booster cries and moves out.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Now I remember! I should look like... THIS!

______________________________________________________________________________
The party reaches the top of the tower where Booster keeps the Princess. Mario
peeks through the door.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toadstool: Mario! You DID come to rescue me. I was so frightened and lonely.

           But now that you're here...
           _____________________________
           Mario tries to open the door.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           The door won't open?

           I think we need Booster's spell to undo the lock on it. Oh, what
           should we do?

______________________________________________________________________________
As Mario thinks of a way to free the Princess, they hear Booster's voice.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Booster  : A...ha!

Toadstool: What should we do?!

           Booster is returning, isn't he?
           I know! Hide somewhere and wait until he opens the door.

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario hides behind the curtains. 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

[You can move freely behind the curtains.]

[Good luck hiding from Booster and his Snifits.]

______________________________________________________________________________
Booster and his Snifits enter the room. Booster checks out his pet bird.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Snifit 1 : Boss, shouldn't we be concentrating on the girl?

Booster  : Right!

           Now, about the girl in my life, who thinks I should marry her?

           Well?
           Speak up!

Snifit 2 : A wedding ceremony would make a great PARTY!

Booster  : Ah, a party!
           We haven't had one of those.

           It could be fun!
           So...what is a party?

Snifit 3 : Well, you drink punch and eat CAKE! ...I think.

Booster  : Hmmm...
           Drink punch...eat cake...? It sounds...complicated.

           I don't know if I can muster the energy to do it...
           Let's walk through it once! It's wedding rehearsal time!

______________________________________________________________________________
They take their positions: Booster as the groom, Snifit 1 as the director,
Snifit 2 as the priest, and Snifit 3 as the bride. Snifit 3 holds the
Toadstool doll.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Snifit 1 : We will now begin the ceremony.

           Walk down the aisle with the... (hey someone make her smile!)
           beautiful bride-to-be.

Booster  : Wait!
           Mario always shows up about now to ruin the fun.

           We've got to take that into consideration, you know.
           Someone go and get the Mario doll.

______________________________________________________________________________
The Snifits search for the Mario doll, which is situated above the curtains
Mario is hiding in. They didn't find it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Snifits  : It isn't here.

Booster  : Of course it's here! You lazy slobs couldn't find water if you
           were fish!

           It's behind those curtains!
           Number one, you go and look.

           How creepy! It's a pain, but I think we should check one more time.

&gt;&gt; If Mario is caught for the second time &gt;&gt;
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Booster  : Well?

           I think one more peek is necessary.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

           Wait a second!
           It's right up there. I found the Mario doll!

           But we'll NEVER be able to reach it up there.
           Oh! The sorrow!

           What AM I gonna do...?

           I'm about to lose it...sniffle...

           and reaches it for Booster.

           You're so kind! Thank you for getting my doll.

Scene: Booster is about to run up the hill, with Toadstool tied on his back.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toadstool: Please, let me go!
           Won't you...please?
           Pretty please?

Booster  : Eh?
           Hey, where's my bride-to-be?
           I wanna play hide and seek, too!

Toadstool: Yuck, I don't want to play ANYTHING with you!

Booster  : What a poor sport! Well, we really should hurry along.
           A yummy cake is waiting for us after we climb this hill!
           Let's GO!

Toadstool: NO! I don't want to marry you. Please let me go!
           ______________
           Mario arrives.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Help! Mario! Please help meeeeeeee!

Booster  : Uh oh! It's Mario!
           We didn't plan on this.

           Mario, you aren't invited to our wedding!
           Besides, we still have to have the rehearsal!

           I'll be happy to race you to the wedding hall, but......
           you'd better not get in my way.

           Ready?

Raz &amp; Raini: Haaaaaaalp!!

______________________________________________________________________________
Scene: After racing with Booster, Mario arrives at the wedding hall, just in
time to see Raz and Raini get kicked out of their own wedding ceremony.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Snifit 1 : Booster's wedding is in progress.

           We've barricaded the door, so don't even bother trying to sneak
           inside.

           I'm not letting you in here! And you can forget about the back
           entrance. It's locked. (At least I THINK it is...)

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario finds a way through the back door. He was heading straight for the hall,
but Snifit 1 detects him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Snifit 1 : Halt! Who goes there?

           You LOOK like Mario, but the door's shut tight.
           Listen, Mustache, you and your overgrown turtle-friend can take a
           hike! Go! Scat!
           Make like Mario and jump outta here! GET LOST!

Mario    : (jump)

Snifit 1 : Oops... We've got a problem...
           I'd better go tell Booster.
           ________________________________________________
           Snifit 1 charges the door to open it, but fails.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           It won't budge.

           Say, wanna help me bust this door down?!
           On the count of 3, we'll run TOGETHER! Timing's the key!

           Ready? Here we go!...

______________________________________________________________________________
They both bring the door down, but Snifit 1 didn't brake, resulting in him
and another Snifit to crash all the way to the wedding hall room. Mario stops
himself to a halt outside the hall, and listens to what's happening.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Snifit 1 &amp; 2: Booster, Sir! Mario's here!

Booster  : You clowns! You DON'T break a door down when entering a room!

           Shut it! SHUT IT NOW! Move it, MOVE IT!!!!

Toadstool: Mario! Is that you, Mario?! I'm in here!! Hurry! I'm scared!

______________________________________________________________________________
The Snifits close the door.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Snifits  : We're pretty sure Mr. Mustache can't break in here.
           But that turtle looks pretty mean. He could be trouble!

Bowser   : They have no IDEA what they're up against!

           I'm lightning in a bottle! I'm an earthquake in a can! I'll bust
           this open in no time!
           __________________________________________________________
           Bowser tries to open it with his shell, but he fails, too.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           You don't bring too much to the party, but why don't you help me
           here, anyway.
           At least you'll feel like you did SOMETHING!

______________________________________________________________________________
They bust the door. However, they bumped into the Snifits, which in turn 
bumped into Booster and the Princess, causing all of her equipment to fly all
over the room.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toadstool: Owwwwww! Watch what you're doing!

           Great!....

           Now I've dropped my shoes, my ring,..my brooch and ...MY CROWN!!!

______________________________________________________________________________
The Princess cries.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Snifits  : Booster, Sir!

Snifit 1 : Booster, I, um...

Booster  : Don't bother me now.

           Okay, everyone!
           The bride is growing impatient! Let the wedding begin...!

           What's this...?
           Water...coming from your eyes?!
           Are you leaking, my dear?!

           Tastes salty!

Snifit 2 : Booster, Sir, uh... I believe that the bride may be...
           uh,...Crying...

Booster  : Crying? But that's what people do when they're...sad!!

           How DISGUSTING! That stuff may be corrosive!
           It tastes...like the sea!

           What could be making her...cry, anyway?

Snifit 3 : I believe she is crying because she has dropped some of her...
           wedding gear.

Booster  : Aha! Of course!
           She has dropped her gear.

           But those tears will ruin the cake! Make her stop...
           ...before Mario breaks in!

Snifits  : But... Mario's ALREADY in...

Snifit 2 : BOOSTER, Sir, hurry and find her things! We have to get on with
           the wedding!

           In the mean time, perhaps we can ...do something about the cake...

Booster  : 10-4, good buddy.

           You find her stuff... I'll move the ceremony forward.
           Hurry!

Snifit 2 : Booster, Sir, you're supposed to be on the right.
           The bride should be on your left.

Booster  : Just testing... Like this, right?

Snifit 3 : Booster, Sir! I found the Ring!

Snifit 1 : Booster! Here's the Brooch!

Snifit 2 : Booster, Sir! I found the Shoes!

Booster  : ...Hey wait!
           Wasn't there one more thing?

Snifits  : ...You're right! The Crown!

[Hurry and get back the accessories from the Snifits and save Princess
 Toadstool! If you're quick, something good just might happen!]

Snifit 2 : Ho HO! I'll look for the last one. YOU go give this to Booster.

           [Got her Shoes!]

Snifit 1 : Ho HO! I'll look for the last one. YOU go give this to Booster.

           [Got her Brooch!]

Snifit 3 : Ho HO! I'll look for the last one. YOU go give this to Booster.

           [Got her Ring!]

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario finds the Crown on Booster's head and gives all the other accessories
to him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Booster  : HO HO! Here it is!
           ...HEY! You're Mario!

           So! You've come to crash my wedding, I presume?

Toadstool: Mario!... You're FINALLY here!

______________________________________________________________________________
Upon seeing Bowser, the Princess jumps away in terror.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toadstool: SHRIEK!!! What is Bowser doing HERE?

Bowser   : What a waste of time! I've got bigger fish to fry...!

Toadstool: I know I'm in good hands when you're around, Mario!

           Here's a kiss for my hero!

Bowser   : Oh, isn't that great!
           You're gonna kiss HIM when I'm the one who saved your skin!

Booster  : Me too! I want a reward!

           I'll take a kiss! Give me a KISS!!!

Toadstool: Stop it, all of you! I'm getting SO confused!
           Mario, let's start with you!

______________________________________________________________________________
Scene: If Mario was fast enough in obtaining her items, he would get a kiss
from the Princess. But if he's too slow, he would get a kiss from Bowser or
Booster, or worst, from both of them.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

&gt;&gt; If it was Booster who kissed Mario &gt;&gt;

Booster  : Aaaaaah....
           I shall never forget that touch...

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Bowser &amp; Booster: Feels like...SANDPAPER!

                  WHAT THE!!!...

Toadstool: Now THAT's one for the scrapbook!
           Come, Mario, let's get back to Mushroom Kingdom.
           The Chancellor's waiting for us.

______________________________________________________________________________
Bowser reluctantly comes with them. Just as they were about to leave, Chef
Torte and his apprentice delivers the cake.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Chef Torte: Zorry to haf kept you vaiting.

Apprentice: We've made the most AMAZING cake! You won't believe it!!

Chef Torte: Heir ist cake...
            But...vhere are bride und groom?

Chefs     : Where...is...EVERYONE?

Apprentice: This is BIG trouble!

Chef Torte: Za bride ist LEAFING?

Apprentice: You're taking the bride...AWAY?!

Chef Torte: But...Zhere von't be anyone to eat zees cake!

Apprentice: What?! This can't be! We worked ALL DAY on it!

Both      : YOU FOOLS!

______________________________________________________________________________
They battle. Apparently, Torte and his apprentice cannot be hurt (it's the way
the game works), so the party has to resort to attacking the cake. After some
damage is done, the cake moves.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Apprentice: Poke, poke, poke!

Torte     : Ouch! OUCH! Vat are you doing?!

Apprentice: Chef Torte! The cake's MOVING!

Torte     : Vas?! Ist NOT moving! Back to verk!

Apprentice: I KNOW it was moving!

______________________________________________________________________________
The cake moves again.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Apprentice: Poke, poke, poke!

Torte     : Ouch! OUCH! Now vat?

Apprentice: Chef Torte! The cake's MOVING!

Torte     : Talk no more of zees!

Apprentice: No! Really, truly. Why would I lie?

Torte     : Because you are...IDIOT!

            Zee! It IS NOT moving!

______________________________________________________________________________
The cake jiggles in front of them.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Both      : Huh?!

Torte     : Zee cake's alive! RUN!!

Apprentice: See? I was RIGHT!

______________________________________________________________________________
The chefs run away from their creation, and now the cake lights its own
candles. It battles the party.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

[Blow those candles out!]

______________________________________________________________________________
After the party has blasted off most of the cake,  the Snifits intervene.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Snifit 1 : Maybe we ought to wait.

Snifit 2 : This is Booster's wedding cake!

Snifit 3 : He'll have a fit if we nibble on it!

______________________________________________________________________________
Booster arrives and uses the cake as a platform.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Booster  : Hey, No.1! Where's my cake?!

Snifit 1 : Booster, Sir! There's a 70% chance the object you're standing on is
           a cake.

Booster  : ........?

           THIS thing's a cake?
           __________________________
           Booster gets off the cake.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Okay, everyone!! Here's the stumper. How do we eat this? I SAY we
           boil it! No.2, what do you say?

Snifit 2 : Way too messy! Why don't you just swallow it?!

Booster  : WHAT?! In one GULP? That's easier said than done!

Snifit 3 : Come, Booster! You can do it! Open wide, please!

Booster  : My nerves are shot. I feel like I've forgotten to tie my cord
           before a bungee jump!

Snifits  : Here it comes!

Booster  : WAIT! WAIT! Did the cake just move?

Snifits  : Concentrate, Sir!

Booster  : This doesn't feel right.

______________________________________________________________________________
The Snifits throw the cake to Booster's mouth, and he swallows it whole.
Booster falls to the ground, crying and happy.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Booster  : Mmmmmm... Delicious! It's so good it makes me want to cry!

Snifits  : Congratulations, Sir. The wedding is now officially over!!

Booster  : Thanks, everyone.

           It's a wrap. Let's go.

______________________________________________________________________________
Booster and his Snifits go home. Mario's party wins.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toadstool: That was wonderful. Mario, you're my knight in shining armor.

           Finally...let's get back.

           Oh, what a day...! Can you believe it?! I almost got MARRIED to
           that...thing!
           But I...I hope someone marries me someday!

           [&quot;Toadstool&quot;, Princess of Mushroom Kingdom, has joined the party.]
           [Be sure to bring her back safely!]

______________________________________________________________________________
They come out to see the whole wedding party eagerly waiting for them.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Raz      : Mario! That creepy guy just left!
           Does that mean we can go on with our wedding?

Mario    : (nods)

Raini    : Oh, Raz! I'm so happy!

           Let's get this wedding over with so we can stay in the suite, and
           then go on our honeymoon!

Raz      : Let's do it!

           All right...

Raini    : You'll have to excuse us!

Mario    : (nods again)

Raz      : Okay, everyone!
           We're gonna start this from the beginning! Back inside, please!

______________________________________________________________________________
That day, Raz and Raini were married. After attending the event, the party
was about to go back to the Mushroom Kingdom, but Mario has other plans...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toadstool: Mario! The Chancellor is WAITING...! We're going back now, right?!

           :: (No)
</pre><pre id="faqspan-3">
Mallow   : Mario! The Chancellor must be worried sick about us. You saw him
           before! C'mon, let's GO.

           :: (NO!)

Geno     : Mario! If we don't get the Princess back, WE'LL be charged with
           kidnapping! Let's go!

           :: (NO!)

Bowser   : Mario! No one, NO ONE, is authorized to kidnap the Princess except
           ME! It just wouldn't be right!
           Let's take her back to Mushroom Kingdom, where she belongs!

           :: (Forget it)

Party    : Enough, already!

______________________________________________________________________________
The party gangs up against Mario and returns to the Mushroom Kingdom.

Toad     : Mario!... Welcome back!! You look like you're in one piece!

           P...P..Princess!

Toadstool: I'm finally home!
           And with Mario... and some wonderful... new friends! They saved
           my life.

Toad     : Let's go find the Chancellor...

Toadstool: Lead on!

           Come on Mario. We mustn't keep the Chancellor waiting!

______________________________________________________________________________
They head straight for the Chancellor's room.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toad      : Chancellor!
            The...the Princess... She's BACK!!

Chancellor: Thank goodness!
            This has been a true nightmare!

            I'm a nervous wreck!

Toadstool : I know I've worried everyone...

            But I'm fine! I can take care of myself...
            With a little help from Mario!

Chancellor: Come, everyone!
            Let's get out of this drafty doorway!

Toadstool : Mario, I hope you know how thankful we are!

            But...you MUST tell me one thing! How on earth can you trust...
            Bowser?

Chancellor: Trust...Bowser? What ARE you talking about?!

______________________________________________________________________________
Mallow, Geno and Bowser present themselves.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Chancellor: Mario! What are YOU doing with...

            WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

            EGADS!

Toadstool : Chancellor!
            Listen, everyone, RELAX! Mario's got things under control!

Chancellor: Y, yes...I see.

Toadstool : Bowser... Perhaps it's time you told us your story!

            What, exactly, did you mean when you said you had, &quot;Bigger fish
            to fry?&quot;

Bowser    : (Can't...tell 'em...the truth...If this gets out...
             I'm finished...!)

Mallow    : Excuse me, Sir... Perhaps I can set the stage, and the others can
            add their comments along the way!

            The Princess, Bowser and Mario were thrown in different directions
            after a terrible explosion...

            Something HUGE crashed through the Star Road high above Bowser's
            place...and...

            And went... KABOOM! Right into Bowser's Keep!!

            It was a gigantic sword!

            Now Bowser's Keep has been taken over by monsters who work for
            some creep named &quot;Smithy.&quot;

Bowser    : They've thrown me out of my own... I mean...
            I decided to take a vacation!
            They CAN'T do this to me!
            Anyway, I was working on a plan to get my house back, when...
            ...Mario walked up to me and BEGGED me to let him join the Koopa
            Troop! I had no choice but to let him in. It was pathetic.

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario immediately comes up to the Chancellor and the Princess to tell them
what Bowser is saying is not exactly true.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toadstool: It's okay, Mario. We know Bowser's stretching the truth a little!

           And...Mallow...how about you? Why are you traveling with Mario?

Mallow   : Well, because Mario's helping me find my real home... And
           my parents...

           That's why we're on the road together.

Toadstool: WHAT?! This is dreadful news! Awful! Horrible...!

           I hope you find your real parents soon!

           And...um, Geno,... was it? Why are you and Mario...

Geno     : The Star Road has been destroyed. I'm here to fix it.

           Mario is helping me search for the Star Pieces. I need them to
           rebuild the road...

Toadstool: Star...Pieces?

Mallow   : The Star Road grants our wishes!

           Unless we find all the Star Pieces and fix the Star Road, we can
           kiss our dreams goodbye!

Toadstool: WHAT?! This is dreadful news! Awful! Horrible...!

           Isn't it?

Geno     : Indeed...for example...
           Say Bowser kidnapped you. Without the aid of the Star Road, you'd
           probably never be rescued!

Bowser   : Actually, that sounds pretty GOOD to me! Let's just forget about
           these...Star...things!

Toadstool: Great, Bowser. Then you can just kiss your precious &quot;Keep&quot; goodbye!

Bowser   : HUH?! WHAT?!

           Huh? Let's see. If Mario can't find the stars... Toadstool will
           be MINE! But I won't get my Keep back... unless Mario finds the
           stars! So if I want my Keep back... we need those star things,
           but... Huh?! Run that past me again!

Toadstool: Urgh!!! Just ignore that idiot!
           I just don't think I could take a world without wishes...

           We need to go and find those Star Pieces, NOW!

The Chancellor protests against the Princess' decision.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Chancellor: Princess! You CAN'T be serious! You're NOT thinking of joining
            them, ARE YOU?

            This is sheer madness... You're a Princess!
            What will people say?!

Toadstool : I don't care! Things seem so hopeless right now...

            I'm tired...
            I think I need to lie down in my room for awhile.

            Mario...Mallow...Geno and...Bowser, you too...
            Good luck!

Chancellor: Now then! Thanks to Mario, the Princess is back. I now declare
            this date to be known forever as,...

            ...Hey, wait a minute! You don't suppose...

            Could it have been this &quot;Smithy&quot; who attacked our Kingdom?

            I fear we have no cause to rejoice. In fact, Mario, we must ask
            you for yet another favor...

            Please...on behalf of all of us, you MUST defeat Smithy...

            It is the only was we shall ever live in peace again.

            [Princess Toadstool is home safe, but she has... decided to stay
             at the Kingdom!]

Toadstool: Mario! Please, Mario!
           Take me along with you, please!

           Don't worry.
           Grandma helped me through this one, so no one will ever notice that
           I'm gone!

           So...let's go find us a star!
           Hmmm... But I wonder where it could be... I have absolutely no idea!
           Do you?

Mallow   : Mario! At times like these....

Toadstool: What should we do?

Mallow   : We should ask Grandpa! My Grandpa should know!

Toadstool: Okay then!
           Let's do it!

           [Just as I thought! Toadstool joins the party once AGAIN!]

Frogfucius: I have the latest news, children.

            A large star's been sighted on &quot;Star Hill&quot;.

-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯



Geno     : This is Star Hill.
           Wishes, which were transformed at the Star Road, fall from here.

           But....
           Some wishes that haven't been granted yet are falling because
           Smithy destroyed the Star Road.

           Frogfucius mentioned hearing about a Star Piece on this hill.

           Let's see if we can find it.

______________________________________________________________________________
Scene: The party views some of the fallen wishes.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

&quot;Can't wait to start a family.&quot;

&quot;I hope my baby's cute!&quot;

&quot;I wish I weren't such a crybaby.&quot;

Mallow   : This one's private! Who do you think you are, spying on other
           people's wishes?

           C'mon, our quest for the Star Pieces is important!

           Everyone's counting on us! We've got to hurry!

           Sorry about that. It's just that I'm embarassed about my wish.

&quot;Wish I had some Cricket Jam.&quot;

&quot;If I could JUST get that melody!&quot;

&quot;The hunger! Oh, for some food!&quot;

&quot;I vant to be a vald class baker.&quot;

&quot;I wanna be the best treasure hunter in the world.&quot;

&quot;Please let Mallow find his way home.&quot;

Mallow   : Why, this wish is...

           It's from my mom and dad.

           They're wishing for me to come home!

           Sniffle...

           This isn't the time to be crying!
           They're waiting for me to come home!

           Come on Mario, we've got a busy schedule to keep. I'll make you eat
           dust if you don't hurry.

&quot;I hope I become famous.&quot;

&quot;(Wish I could run faster.)&quot;

&quot;I wanna be a great plumber like my brother Mario.&quot;

-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯


______________________________________________________________________________
Scene: In this town, the townspeople are acting really weird. Some of them
have watching mushrooms as their pastime, and watching you while you are
asleep. The slightly sane ones tell of a sunken pirate ship under the command
of a certain &quot;Jonathan Jones&quot;, and that he had obtained a star. They refer you
to the village elder for more details.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Elder    : Finally!
           It took you long enough!

           I am the ELDER of this village.

           I got to my exalted station in life by...pleasing my superiors,
           which is something I do well.

           A star has fallen into the ocean. I need it for...a certain purpose.
           You...must find it for me.

           You'll find the star in &quot;Jonathan Jones'&quot; territory. Don't worry,
           you can beat him. (At least I THINK you can.) Hurry and bring back
           the star!

                                  Sunken Ship
-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯


______________________________________________________________________________
Scattered all over the ship are several travel logs about what happened to the
ship in its final moments. It turns out that the ship was sunk when a giant
squid got hold of it. The crew managed to trap the squid inside the treasure
cellar. To access the treasure cellar, Mario and the party must find out the
password, with 6 hints to help.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

King Calamari: Good job...I'll let you through...If you can get past ME first,
               that is.

______________________________________________________________________________
Anyway, after they have figured out the password (PEARLS), the giant squid
lets them in. They battle. Mario's party wins.

After defeating the squid, the party swims through more levels to reach
Jonathan Jones. A batch of Bandana Reds guard the door.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Pirates  : Arrrr! What's goin' on HERE?! Who're YOU...?

           What?! You're lookin' fer a STAR? I'LL let ya see stars, arr harr!

           Anyway, yer outta luck!
           Ya see, whatever falls into the sea becomes JOHNNY'S property! Got
           that, MATEY?!

           Oh, and one last thing... Read my lips...
           WE AIN'T LETTIN' YA THROUGH!
           GOT IT?!
           _______________________________________________
           Mario and the party dissolves their resistance.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Arrr! You're stronger than ya look...

           Better warn the upper deck! Come on, mates!

______________________________________________________________________________
The pirates leave him to report to the others. Mario was climbing the stairs
to Johnny's quarters when the pirates go back down and run over him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Pirates  : All right, where's the intruder?!

           I don't see 'im. Did he get away?!

           THERE HE IS!, Get 'im boys!
           _____________________________________________________________
           Mario climbs the stairs, but another team of sharks stop him.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Here, this is on us!!
           __________________________________________________________________
           The upper sharks throws a barrel, but instead of hitting Mario, it
           toppled the sharks below.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           WHAT THE?! How dare you dodge the barrel!
           ________________________
           At the final checkpoint.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           HEY! How'd you get up here so fast?

           Well, your &quot;luck&quot; has run out!
           We don't take kindly to strangers here!
           _____________________________________
           Once again, the party wipes them out.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           You're pretty tough, mate. All right. I'll let you through Johnny's
           place.

Johnny   : So you're THE Mario, eh? Arr, harr, harr...! Not much to look at...
           Well, this star fell into MY SEA, so it's MINE!
           If you want it, you'll have to fight for it!
           _____________________________________________________
           &gt;&gt; If you beat all of his crew and leave him alone &gt;&gt;
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Fuwa ha ha... Not bad, fellas.

           How about it, Mario? Mario versus me! Wanna mix it up?

Mario    : (nods)

Johnny   : Good fun! And good for you, too!

           All right. Here comes my backup!

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario and Johnny fight in a one-on-one duel. Whoever your allies are and the
Bandana Blues just watch from the sidelines. Mario wins.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Johnny   : I'm impressed, matey! You've earned the star.

           Think of it as a souvenir of our fight!

Cinematic: The marine star rises up and spins around Mario, landing on his
hands. The party now has the fifth Star Piece.

Elder     : Eee hee hee! You found the star! Well done!

            But your journey ends here. You are so gullible! Don't you know who
            I am?

            I'm &quot;Yaridovich&quot;, a member of Smithy's gang. Shocked?

            It's no wonder! My impersonation of an ordinary person was flawless.

            Your search for the stars has worried Smithy.

            So if I take that star back to him, I'll earn brownie points. THIS
            is the way to get ahead!

            It's futile to try and fight me. Just hand it over, nice and easy.

            :: (Get serious!)

            So that's how you want to play it? What do you think will happen to
            the real inhabitants of Seaside Town?

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario gives up the star.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Yaridovich: Eee hee hee! And to think I got the star without even soiling my
            hands!

            I'm such a genius, it scares me sometimes.

            No wonder I'm so important!

            All right everyone, listen up. We're returning to the castle!
            Our ride should be here about now.

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario and the party follows Yarid to the shore and finds them stranded there.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Yaridovich: Blade's late. What's taking him so long?

            We need to get out of here.

            This is JUST great!
            Mario caught up with us.

            Only one thing we can do now. Although we may rust a little, we'll
            have to swim for it.

Johnny    : Not so fast there!
            That star's a gift to me mate, Mario.

            You spineless dogs have no code of honor!

            We'll make you walk the plank!

Pirate    : Johnny, maybe we should leave Mario the pleasure of wrapping things
            up here.

Yaridovich: Eee hee...! I guess we'll have to take our disguises off now...

            GROUP formation!

______________________________________________________________________________
Yarid and his companions merge together to create a boss. They battle. Mario's
party wins.

And with that victory, the party reclaimed the fifth star.

To Mario,

Knowin' you, it must've been a breeze knockin' down Yarid, eh?

By the way, my pirates say they saw a huge AX flyin' across the sky. It's
probably one of Smithy's nasty friends. Go GET him, pal!

Well, my gills are failing on me, so I'll be headin' back down. Drop in
whenever you have time, okay?

Now that the mystery of Seaside Town, Mario can now ask the real elder for
advice on what to do next.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Elder    : Mario, if it's a star that you're looking for, I may be able to
           help you.

           At the far side of &quot;Land's End&quot; is a town made up of reformed
           monsters.

           A mouse came by the other day, and I overheard him boasting about a
           &quot;star&quot; of theirs.

           I don't know exactly where this town is located, but if you follow
           the road, you'll get there.

Rat      : Ahhh! Haven't been here in a while. I've been busy traveling around.

           Where are you heading?
           Is it Monstro Town by any chance?

           :: (Nope)

           Oh, I thought you were lost or something.
           Never mind, I'll see you around.

           :: (Yes)

           Ok, listen up. Look for the whirl where the ant pops up and proceed
           after it. Keep following and you'll find your way underground. Once
           there, Monstro Town's just around the corner. I'll see you there.

______________________________________________________________________________
Later, the party catches up with the rat, facing a giant stone obstacle.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Rat      : Oh! Hello again. Isn't this incredible?

           It's too spooky for me! I'm heading back to Monstro Town. See ya!

The party passes through the underground route. Just before they made it to
the town, Belome once again blocks their way. They battle.

Belome   : Hmm, you look so tasty. I think I'll have a snack!

           I never forget a taste! In fact, I can clone someone after just one

             Oh you're here to see OUR star!

             She's upstairs, so feel free to go and take a look for yourself.

______________________________________________________________________________
The party heads upstairs to see the star, but is disappointed when what they
saw wasn't a real Star Piece, but just another star-like creature.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Monstermama: So what do you think? Isn't our star adorable? She's so talented
             too! Folks come to see her from afar.

             Starbees...?
             Oh, Star Piece! Nope, not familiar with 'em.

             So you came all the way out here to search for a Star Piece? It
             must be REALLY important.

             This is the last place on land. If you can't find it here...

             The only place left, is UP!

             So! You wanna go ther? Ha! You're an open book!

             Ok, here's what you need to do. There's a secret passage to the
             sky at...Bean Valley! But first you must scale the cliff beyond
             the desert to get there.

             Since you're such a nice guy, I'll introduce you to someone that
             can help you.

             Sky Troopas, I need you!

______________________________________________________________________________
After a few moments, they hear a fluttering sound of incoming wings (engines?)
and a group of Sky Troopas enter the room in military formation.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Sergeant Flutter: What was our flying time, troops?

Troops          : ....8.52 seconds, Sergeant!

______________________________________________________________________________
They reform themselves to face the landlady and her visitor. Flutter salutes.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

S. Flutter : Sky Troopas reporting for duty, MA'AM!

             We're 0.52 seconds late! I hold myself personally accountable for
             the delay, Ma'am!

Monstermama: Still as rigid as ever about your rules and regulations? No need
             to bother with the protocol around me, Sergeant. I've got a favor
             to ask of you.

S. Flutter : Yes Ma'am! Anything we can do for a civilian.

Monstermama: This fellow here REALLY wants to get to Bean Valley. Could you
             help him scale the cliff?

S. Flutter : Understood, Ma'am!

             The orders are: &quot;Get Mustache over the cliff&quot;!
             We WILL succeed!

             We will now deploy ourselves to the cliff at Land's End. Troopas,
             keep a tight formation!

             We have lift off!

______________________________________________________________________________
With smoke coming out of their shells, the Sky Troopas move out.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Monstermama: They're odd, but trustworthy! Good luck with your search!

______________________________________________________________________________
At Land's End...

The Sky Troopas form a series of platforms in mid-air, with Sergeant Flutter
at the very top of the cliff.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Sergeant Flutter : Ten-hut! All troops in positions!

                   Mario, your mission is to scale the cliff, by jumping from
                   shell to shell.

______________________________________________________________________________
Once Mario reaches the top, Sergeant Flutter then rates you on how well he did.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

______________________________________________________________________________
At the end of the stage is a special piranha plant called the Smilax, which
is taken care of by a Shy Away. They battle. After the party kills the sets of
mini-piranha plants:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Shy Away (singing): La dee dah~

                    (1st set) - It's shower time~
                    (2nd set) - It's recycled water!
                    (3rd set) - I added some nutrients~

                    There there, my pretties!

                    Hi ho, dee dum~

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario's party wins.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Shy Away : Look what you did! Smilax's been whacked.

           Oooh, I'm going to get it!
           Queen Valentina told me to keep everyone out of Nimbus Land.

           What should I do?

           ................................ I know, I'll run away!

______________________________________________________________________________
The Shy Away does fly away, but leaves behind a Seed. After the party checks
it out, they go down a pipe where the Smilax used to be. They find a brick
block, and as what players always do in the games, Mario bumps it up and a
strange vine grows out of it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

[Wow! Did you see that? It's a magical beanstalk!
 Hit the block once more to climb it.]

______________________________________________________________________________
And the party climbs the vines... all the way to Nimbus Land.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Valentina: All right, everyone! Listen up!

______________________________________________________________________________
Scene: Outside the Nimbus palace, the people have come out to hear news about
the King through his acting officer, Valentina. However, they aren't listening
at all, so...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Valentina: SHUDDAP!!!

           King Nimbus' condition is growing worse... This means we'll be
           losing... ...our magnificient ruler...

           BUT!

           It just so happens that I have found the missing Prince! Prince
           Mallow, that is!

           Prince Mallow... Please...Sir...Prince?

           ...GET OVER HERE!!!

           Well, well... It seems that our little prince has a mild case of
           stage fright. Excuse me...Ha ha ha...
           _________________________________
           Valentina goes inside the palace.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           (Come ON! Make it snappy!)

           (What?! You can't get through? Well, just LOOK at you, tubby!)

______________________________________________________________________________
Valentina comes out with a fat black bird, which does not even look half the
average Nimbus citizen.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Valentina  : Introducing... ...Prince Mallow!

Townspeople: Welcome back! Prince Mallow!

             My, you've...er...filled out a bit, Prince Mallow!

             You're looking fit, Prince!

Valentina  : Yes...? What is it, dear?...

______________________________________________________________________________
&quot;Prince Mallow&quot; supposedly whispers something into Valentina's ears.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Valentina: WHAT?! You're asking ME to...?

           Gracious! You're serious, aren't you? Why, I don't know what to say!

           Dear me......

           I've made my decision...
           At the request of the Prince, I agree to become his queen.

           (Queen... Valentina...Ooh! It just makes me SHIVER!!)

           Well, that's that! Back to your business, everyone!

           (Hurry it up, will ya?!)

Mallow   : Can you believe it?!
           What a coincidence! There's a prince with the same name as ME!

           Don't we have anything better to do that hang around HERE? Come on,
           let's go and find the rest of the Star Pieces!!

______________________________________________________________________________
The party stays for a while anyway, and talks to the other Nimbus people. Then
they enter house of Garro the gold-sculptor, and sees a Mallow statue.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mallow   : Hey look! It's ME!

Garro    : Oh, you mean THAT? That's King Numbus when he was... a ...young lad.

           ...!...! Huh?

           ...What the...?!...
           WHO are YOU...?!

Mallow   : Hello. My name is Mallow.
           And this is my friend, Mario.

Garro    : Mallow... So it IS YOU, my boy! It's been so long. My, you've become
           a splendid young prince!

Mallow   : WHAT?! I'm...I'm really a...prince?!

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario demos Mallow's life story.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Garro    : Yes indeed! I understand.
           So! You were raised by Frogfucius!

           There's no question about it! You ARE, WITHOUT A DOUBT...
           Prince Mallow.

Mallow   : Mario! Look at me! I'm a prince!

Mario    : (duh)

Garro    : I KNEW Valentina was up to SOMETHING! I just didn't know what...

           That must mean that the King really ISN'T gravely ill...!

Mallow   : Then let's go inside the castle and save my mother and father!

______________________________________________________________________________
Mallow marches straight for the castle. But the guards stop him so he couldn't
enter. The little prince comes back, crying.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Garro    : ...Wait! I have an excellent idea. Come over here...

           Are you ready?

           :: (Yes)

           All right, stand over here. Hold still, okay?

______________________________________________________________________________
Garro gradually covers Mario with a nice coat of gold.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Garro    : THERE! Hey, don't move!

           You're going to be a &quot;statue&quot; for a while, okay?

           Let's get going now.

______________________________________________________________________________
Together with a Valentina statue for props, Garro carts the Mario statue into
the palace entrance.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Garro    : I'm delivering Valentina's latest order for her.

Guard    : You may enter.

           Halt! Who goes there?

           Hey, this doesn't look like Valentina at all!

Garro    : Oh?! That's because this is a statue of Valentina's nephew, Mari...
           Mariotta! Okay?!

Guard    : Uh...okay. Proceed.

______________________________________________________________________________
The party gets in the palace.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Garro    : Phew, that was close... Didn't think we could get through THAT ONE.
           There IS no such person named Mariotta. Ha!

Valentina: O, ho, ho, ho!!

           Oh! Now THIS is lovely! My beauty simply shines forth like the sun!
           Only YOU can make something THIS stunning!

Garro    : Thank you, your majesty.
           I'll be on my way now...

Valentina: Halt!

           What, may I ask is THIS ugly thing?

Garro    : That's my latest masterpiece. I...I created it just for YOU...
           It's called...

           &quot;A Plumber's Lament&quot;

           Observe...the thick mustache...covering the sad, innocent smile of
           a simple fool...

           And the sideburns... conveying his blue collar roots.

           And the legs...well defined...Strong. The legs of the masses!
           Is it to your liking?

Valentina: Hmmm... I consider myself something of an art buff! And I've got to
           say... This is spectacular!!

           Garro...only YOU could have created sculptures with such gentle
           beauty and...raw power!

Garro    : Thank you, your majesty.
           I'll be on my way now...

Valentina: ...... SPECTACULAR!!

           DODO!...DODO!!...
           Don't just sit there like a roast! Hurry and carry these in!

           .........DODO!! Step on it!

______________________________________________________________________________
Dodo carries the new statues to their respective places. The party was about
to continue their infiltration plan when suddenly Valentina comes back.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Valentina: DODO! Did you display the statues properly?

           Fine! Now polish them to a fine luster and make them a tribute to
           my beauty!

           Pay attention to me!
           Hurry up, and DON'T let me catch you dozing again.

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario hurries back to his pedestal and resumes his statue pose.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

[Uh oh... Dodo's in a pretty bad mood. Keep your statue disguise to avoid
 getting pecked. Get ready cause he's coming this way!]

__________________________________________
&gt;&gt; If Mario was able to dodge all pecks &gt;&gt;
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

[Pick up a &quot;Feather&quot;.]

________________________________________
&gt;&gt; If Dodo sees the Mario statue move &gt;&gt;
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Valentina: What? You saw a statue move? Don't be ridiculous.

           You're just stalling, so you won't have to polish them!

____________________________________________________________
&gt;&gt; If Mario was pecked once, Dodo runs back to his master &gt;&gt;
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Valentina: What? The statue was &quot;ticklish&quot;?
           Is that what you said?

           If you try stalling just one more time, I'm gonna have your feathers
           plucked for my pillow. Now SCAT!

_____________________________________________________________
&gt;&gt; If Mario was pecked twice, Dodo runs back to his master &gt;&gt;
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Valentina: STOP BOTHERING ME! If you're so worried, why don't you give it a
           good peck!

______________________________________________________________________________
Dodo comes back and slowly charges one powerful peck. This time, the party
decides to battle Dodo. They win. Dodo leaves them alone. The party exits
the statue room, only to be confronted by the guards. Mario disguises himself
once again.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Guard 2  : I'm absolutely exhausted!

           I hate being a guard! Valentina only gives us the most boring jobs
           to do!!

Guard 1  : But I guess this beats Dodo's job.

Guard 2  : Dodo has to polish Valentina's statues EVERY single day!

Guard 1  : Ha! Here's how I'd do it.

______________________________________________________________________________
The guards start poking Mario with their spears, in order to &quot;polish&quot; him.
Mario jumps up in pain and loses his disguise.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Guard 2  : Hey, tell me something, do statues...move?

Guard 1  : No. Statues don't move.

Guard 2  : Then...explain...THIS!

           It's... one of those hi-tech,...er,...life-like.. realistic ones.
           ...Let's get outta here.

______________________________________________________________________________
The party battles through some enemies until they stumble upon some captives
in the castle.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Retired Guard: I used to be a guard here, until Valentina snatched away my
               keys...and gave me the boot.

               Guess I won't be needing this master key anymore... Would you
               like it?

               :: (No thanks)

               Oh really? You sure? What a shame...this precious key opens the
               middle room, you know.

               So you don't want it, huh?

Mallow       : Wait! Don't say that!

               To be honest, we really REALLY need it!

Retired Guard: Oh, yeah?

               But HE said you didn't need it.

Mallow       : Oh, I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse him, he...he's a little
               shaken up right now.

Retired Guard: ...Oh...Okay...I guess...

               All right, here you go!
               Just don't tell me what you're gonna do with it, okay?

Mallow       : Thank you! We owe you one!

               [Got &quot;Castle Key 1&quot;!]

______________________________________________________________________________
They come back to the said middle door and open it. Inside, they see the same
Shy Away in Bean Valley, but this time it is watering an egg.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Shy Away : La dee dah... Here ya go, big eggie! I'll give ya plenty of
           nutrients so you'll grow up to be big and strong!

           Oh, oh, oh... Mario's already here... He's a fast one, he is...
           ____________________________________________
           The Shy Away tries to get out, but it can't.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Oh, oh, oh... It won't open... it's locked!

???      : Ha ha ha ha.

           I'm so...lonely. Will you play with me?

           :: (Not now)

           Oh... If you had played with me, I was going to give you the key to
           this room.

           :: (Sure)

           Thanks!

______________________________________________________________________________
They battle with the egg. At first, it starts as a dormant shell, but the
party cracks it open.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Birdo    : Hello! I'm Birdo.

           Oh, I'm never gonna let ya go. You're just too...CUTE!

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario's party wins. Birdo gives the key to the room.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

[Got &quot;Castle Key 2&quot;!]

Birdo    : Don't forget about me!

______________________________________________________________________________
Right after that room is another door.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

[This is locked too...]

Mallow   : Mario! Look! There's a note. Let's read it.

King Nimbus is resting in bed.
Absolutely NO RUNNING in the halls.
                                                      Queen Valentina

Mallow   : This can only mean that my mom and dad are here!

           Oh, but it's locked!

Bowser   : Leave it to me!

           Looks like it's up to me to get us out of yet another jam. Feast
           your eyes on this show of brains...and brawn!

           STAND BACK!

Mallow   : WAIT! Wait a minute!

           If my dad's really bedridden, we shouldn't make so much noise.
           ...We need another plan...

           I guess we should find Valentina and force the truth out of her!

Bowser   : But, what about the door?...

           Listen YOU! Never EVER talk to the leader of the Koopa Troop like
           that! Ooh, I hate...THAT! I'll ignore it this time...but DON'T let
           it happen again!

Shy Away : Queen Valentina...

______________________________________________________________________________
The party follows the Shy Away to the conference room.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Shy Away : Queen Valentina... That Mario creature who beat up Smilax is here...

Valentina: Mario...?! What...does a &quot;Mario&quot; look like?

Shy Away : Well...it has a bushy mustache, long sideburns, and, uh, a pair of
           ...mean looking legs...!

Valentina: Hmmm... I have the feeling I've seen this &quot;Mario&quot; before...

           ...Wait! Yes! It was that statue that Garro just delivered...!

Shy Away : What, what, what are we gonna do? What are we GONNA DO, VALENTINA?

Valentina: Well, we certainly aren't going to listen to your pointless chatter.
           Frankly speaking, I'm not going to worry. Without this key, the King
           can't go ANYWHERE!

______________________________________________________________________________
Dodo sees the visitors and calls Valentina's attention by pecking her.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Valentina: Hush...

           I SAID SHUT UP, ALREADY!

______________________________________________________________________________
Dodo points his beak to the party.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Valentina: What the...?! That...that isn't a STATUE!! That's...Mario!!!

Mallow   : VALENTINA!! Hand over the KEY!!, NOW!

______________________________________________________________________________
Mallow moves forward to smack them, but he trips over.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mallow   : Ack!

Valentina: How utterly rude! And who in blazes are YOU anyway?!

Mallow   : Me? I'm the REAL prince, that's who!

Valentina: Brat! And how DARE you listen in on a private conversation...!

Mallow   : Private? PRIVATE?! Everyone in a 10 mile radius could hear you!

Mario    : (nods)

Valentina: Harrumph! If you're going to be THIS rude, I'm simply going to
           leave.

           So long...(chumps)!

Shy Away : Eh? Hey! Valentina ran away...

           I shall fly the coop, too...

Dodo     : (runs away)

Mallow   : Uh...I...I think we kind of missed the boat here...

           So......we'd better get moving too!!
           C'mon let's get 'em!!

______________________________________________________________________________
They follow Valentina and Dodo into the last door, which is a trap in such a
way that it doesn't have a floor. The party lands outside, but safe.

Meanwhile, the people have surrounded Valentina and started asking.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Townspeople: Queen Valentina!

             Queen Valentina, is the King showing any improvement?

             And how is his wife, the old queen?

             And Tubby...er, Prince Mallow... Where is he hiding these days?

             Know what I think? I think...

             Get outta here! The truth is...

Valentina  : Arggghh!!!

             Pipe DOWN!! All of you!!

             I have better things to do than to listen to your half-wit
             opinions! And LOOK...! While I've been wasting my time listening
             to your endless chatter...

             Mario has managed to find me!

             Dodo!! DODO!!

             Ooh! That bird has a permanent brain cramp!!

             Dodo! Do you hear me?! Get over here NOW! I need some help...
             entertaining Mario! So MOVE IT!! Come here NOW!

______________________________________________________________________________
The party engages Valentina in battle.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Valentina: Dodo! DODO! Come here this minute!

           Don't just sit there. HELP ME!

______________________________________________________________________________
Dodo takes the middle character into a one-on-one battle. After Dodo is
defeated, the two of them returns to the main battle.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Valentina: Dodo?! How could you lose already? Well come on! Get over here!

______________________________________________________________________________
Mario's party wins.</pre><pre id="faqspan-4">
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Valentina: I don't believe this!

           The show's over, folks! Dodo...! Let's get outta here!!

           Well, everyone... Until we meet again!

           Mwa, ha, ha, ha, ha...

______________________________________________________________________________
Valentina and Dodo flies away.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mallow   : Great... They're gone...

           Hurry! Let's go after her! I KNOW she has the key!!

______________________________________________________________________________
She does, and Valentina throws the key back at them, landing on top of Mallow.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mallow   : Ack!

           Owwww... Huh?!... Mario! Look!

______________________________________________________________________________
Mallow takes the key and hurries inside the castle. Outside, Mario takes cover
from a brief downpour. After a few more moments, Mallow comes back and signals
it's okay to go in.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mallow      : Mom... Dad... I'd like you to meet Mario...

              ...and my other travel companions!

King Nimbus : I say! How can we ever thank you enough!
              I'm Mallow's father...King Nimbus.

Queen Nimbus: Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for looking after my
              dear child.

Mallow      : Allow me to introduce everyone!

              This...is Princess Toadstool from Mushroom Kingdom...

King Nimbus : Ah! I've heard so much about you! May I...have your authograph?

Queen Nimbus: Don't embarass junior, dear!!

King Nimbus : Oh! Nevermind... And, who is this gentleman here?

Mallow      : THIS....... is Mario!!!
              He helped me from the start!

King Nimbus : I sincerely thank you from the bottom of my heart.

              ......You don't mean... THE Mario?! Jumping Mario?!
              Autograph, please!

Queen Nimbus: That's quite enough, dear...

King Nimbus : Okay, okay! Then...how about showing me just a little jump? A
              tiny hop will do!

Mario       : (jump)

King Nimbus : Oh!...FANTASTIC! (Show me again later...) Eh hem. And WHO do we
              have over here?

Mallow      : This is Bowser, leader of the Koopa Troop.

King Nimbus : Oh! Another famous person! This is just too much!
              I MUST have YOUR autograph!

Queen Nimbus: Dear...behave yourself, please!

King Nimbus : No? Not even a little scribble? Okay, okay...

              Yes, yes. I'm quite forgetting my manners...Well...
              ...Who do we have over here?

Mallow      : This is Geno, who I told you about before.

King Nimbus : Oh! Yes! That story about the Star Street! How awful!

Geno        : That's...Star Road...

Queen Nimbus: By the way, a little before Valentina took over, a large star
              fell into the volcano!

King Nimbus : Hmm, but the dreaded &quot;Czar Dragon&quot; inhabits the volcano. It's
              going to be tough getting a star out of there!

              Hmmm...perhaps all of you working together COULD handle that
              beast...Why, when I was young, I...

Queen Nimbus: Yes, dear...Now, once at the volcano, find Hinopio. He'll be
              able to help you.

              You be careful, Mallow!

Mallow      : Okay, mom! But I probably won't come back until we find the star!

______________________________________________________________________________
Here's what happened to Valentina: after she was defeated, she also went down
on top of Booster Tower, like in Toadstool's case.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Valentina: WHAT are you babbling about? Why should I marry you?

______________________________________________________________________________
Booster whispers something to Valentina, and then he looks over the edge.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Valentina: ........ What a wonderful thing to say!

______________________________________________________________________________
They stand close together, like a sweet couple.

Anyway, the party goes to the springs to gain access to the volcano, and
continue their quest.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Spring Guard: Up ahead are the hot springs... But only royalty is allowed...

              Hey! You're the REAL prince!

              Sorry about the misunderstanding before...There's NO WAY that
              fat bird could have been a Prince, huh?

Mallow      : No big deal. Anyway, do you think you could let us through here?

Spring Guard: Of course!

              Go right ahead. Please, enjoy yourselves. But be careful not to
              fall into the volcano.

______________________________________________________________________________
Nevertheless, the party jumps off into the volcano.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯



Hinopio  : Hey there! Whew...I THOUGHT I heard footsteps! For a minute I
           thought I was nuts!

           I'm Hinopio... This place is a regular INFERNO! Come on,
           step inside!

______________________________________________________________________________
Scene: Hinopio has a mart and an inn right in the middle of the volcano. After
helping you out with what you need, the party walks out into a room of
rotating fireballs. These all form themselves into what is known as the Czar
Dragon. They battle.

As soon as you kill it, it sinks back into the lava and resurrects itself in
the form of Zombone. After you kill that, Mario's party wins.

In the next room they find the red star.

Cinematic: The red star rises up and spins around Mario, landing on his
hands... but suddenly it disappeared!

The star was apparently grabbed by an enemy with an axe, resting on the ledge
above him.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Axem Red   : We got the STAR!

______________________________________________________________________________
Then the other Axems start teleporting in, each doing their flashy intros.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Axem Green : We're amazing!

Axem Yellow: We're unbeatable!

Axem Pink  : We're gorgeous!

Axem Black : You'd better leave now, chumps!

______________________________________________________________________________
The party follows them to find out what the heck is going on.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Axem Black : Hey, Red! Look down there! That's gotta be the ugliest mustache
             I've ever seen!

Axem Pink  : Eww! Gross!

Axem Yellow: That guy's even worse looking than that clod, Mario!

Axem Green : That IS Mario, you IDIOT!!

Axem Red   : Listen, everyone! We gotta get this star to the Blade immediately.
             We'll deal with Mario LATER!!

______________________________________________________________________________
The party starts chasing the Axems.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Axem Yellow: Hey, RED! Careful with this!! You're all thumbs!

______________________________________________________________________________
The Axems jump out of the volcano with a trampoline. The party follows suit.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Axem Pink  : Where's the BLADE?

Axem Red   : He'll be here!

Axem Black : Are you sure?!

Axem Red   : Relax, people!

Axem Yellow: Mario's HERE!!

Axem Red   : He's too late!

Axem Green : Where's the Blade?!

Axem Red   : Shuddap, already!

Axem Rangers: FINALLY!!!!

______________________________________________________________________________
The Axems and the Mario party jumps on the Blade. They battle on top of it.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Axem Red   : We fight for evil!

Axem Black : We live for disorder!

Axem Green : We like what we do!

Axem Pink  : We struggle for chaos!

Axem Yellow: We are...

Altogether : ...the AXEM RANGERS!!

Axem Red   : This Star Piece gives people hope! It needs to be destroyed!

______________________________________________________________________________
After they are individually defeated, they say:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
_______________
&gt;&gt; Axem Pink &gt;&gt;
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Axem Pink  : Yo, RED!!

Axem Red   : What?

Axem Pink  : My make-up's running!!

Axem Red   : Then change brands!
________________
&gt;&gt; Axem Black &gt;&gt;
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Axem Black : Yo, RED!!

Axem Red   : What?

Axem Black : I broke my shades!

Axem Red   : Serves ya right!
_________________
&gt;&gt; Axem Yellow &gt;&gt;
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Axem Yellow: Yo, RED!!

Axem Red   : What?

Axem Yellow: I'm... hungry!!

Axem Red   : Chew on your tongue!
________________
&gt;&gt; Axem Green &gt;&gt;
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Axem Green : Yo, RED!!

Axem Red   : What?

Axem Green : I've got a headache.

Axem Red   : You're totally out of shape!
______________
&gt;&gt; Axem Red &gt;&gt;
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Axem Red   : Ooh, my head is spinning!

______________________________________________________________________________
When all of them are defeated...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Axem Red   : Enough!! Now I'm angry! Time to finish this! Formation...HO!!

             Here we GO!

______________________________________________________________________________
The Axem Rangers activate the robot behind them.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Axem Red   : Force Beam energized! Maximum charge!

             NOW! Fire the BREAKER!!

______________________________________________________________________________
Anyway, the party survives that, and beats down the robot. Mario's party wins.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Axem Red   : This isn't possible! We are...invincible!

Axem Pink  : Can this be happening to the AXEM RANGERS?

Altogether : Uwaaaaaah!!!

______________________________________________________________________________
Cinematic: The Blade crashes down the volcano slope, destroying the glorious
team of the Axem Rangers.

The red star rises up and spins around Mario, landing on his hands. The party
now has the sixth Star Piece.

______________________________________________________________________________
Mallow returns to his home at Nimbus Land.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mallow      : Mom! Dad!

Queen Nimbus: Were you able to find the star, dear?

Mallow      : Yeah. The Axem Rangers took it away from us, but... we got it
              back again!

King Nimbus : That's wonderful! Now the Star, uh...Star Thing can be repaired,
              right?

              I guess not...You're...still...missing a piece, I take it.

Queen Nimbus: The last star... Wait! The only place left to look is in
              Bowser's Keep!

Mallow      : Yeah, we know. But...there's no way to get in. Believe me, we've
              tried, but...

King Nimbus : Yes, yes. Even Mario can't jump THAT far...
              All right! I'll let you use the...

Queen Nimbus: That's IT, dear!

              You should use the royal bus!

King Nimbus : Yes, Mallow, the time has come for you to take the bus!
              Why, when I was your age...

Mallow      : Really?! Are you sure it's all right?

Queen Nimbus: Of course, dear. I've ordered the repair man to have it fixed
              by the time you leave. You simply HAVE to help Mario and the
              others get that last star!

Mallow      : You bet, mom! Come on, Mario, let's GO!

______________________________________________________________________________
The party goes to the Nimbus Bus terminal.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Repair Man: The bus has finally been repaired. We can start operating again.
            ...... Prince Mallow!

Mallow    : We want to go to Bowser's Keep...Could you give us a lift, please?

Repair Man: I've heard the story from King Nimbus. You'll be there in no time!

            Here it comes, here it comes!

            So, how's the engine running?

Bus Driver: Oh, it's purring like a kitten!

Repair Man: Could you take Prince Mallow to the entrance of Bowser's Keep?

Bus Driver: Of course! Can't wait to get this thing running again! Come,
            Prince, hop on board.

Repair Man: All aboard!

Bus Driver: We're off!

______________________________________________________________________________
Cinematic: The people of the other towns in Mario's world stand by as they
watch Mario's party land on Bowser's Keep, and into the waiting claws of
their enemy...

-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯



Bowser   : Ahhh... The scent of boiling lava...

           It's so nice to be home!

           Smithy's gonna pay for stealing my splendid castle from me!

______________________________________________________________________________
Scene: Smithy has taken full control of the Keep, and has placed monsters and
new obstacles in the party's path. Bowser does great by scaring the monsters
off, and even Croco has appeared to give a hand. A few battles later, they
come into a room with several doors.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

[There are 6 doors... Do you need an explanation?]

:: (Yeah)

[Of the 6 doors...]
______________________________________________________________________________
Scene: Floating, shifting platforms over molten lava...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[2 open onto action courses! You can handle a lot of action, right?]
______________________________________________________________________________
Scene: Two statues leading to a very long hallway...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[2 others will lead you to battle courses. You can fight, right?!]
______________________________________________________________________________
Scene: Dr. Topper, the quizmaster...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[The last 2 open onto puzzle courses. No sweat for a great puzzle solver like
 you, right?!]

[Once you choose a course, there's no turning back! The only way to know what's
 behind a door is to walk through it! You must pass 4 of the 6 courses to move
 ahead.]

______________________________________________________________________________
Once the party has finished 4 of the 6 doors, they come out of a room with no
floor in it! Actually, it's just a small drop, and it's nothing to worry about.
However, in the next room there are 2 doors, and Magikoopa.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Magikoopa: This..is..Smithy's castle!

           No trespassers..allowed.

______________________________________________________________________________
They battle. Mario's party wins.

Magikoopa returns to his normal blue color.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Bowser   : Magikoopa!

Magikoopa: Huh..where am I? Bowser, hello! How have you been?

           I, uh, made it back here SOMEHOW, but it seems like I've been
           brainwashed or something.

           I can't seem to remember ANYTHING. Have I done something...wrong?

Bowser   : Uh, don't worry about it. Let's just put it behind us.

           It's great running into a loyal Koopa Trooper like you.

Magikoopa: I'm glad! It looks like you've got some tough new troopers now.

           But my magic can still help you.

           Watch this!
                        Ho'okalakupua!
           ___________________________________________________________
           Magikoopa creates a floating golden question box in midair.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           This magic treasure box will never run out of coins. Just keep on
           hitting it.

           I'll be here if you need me.

           Come by whenever you need to rejuvenate your HP and magic.

______________________________________________________________________________
The party continues until they enter a room very much like the one in which
Mario and Bowser fought in the very beginning of the game. And guess what,
someone is also standing on the chandelier.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Boomer   : Ha ha ha ha ha!

           Ahhhhh... So YOU are the notorious Mario!

           I'm impressed you made it this far. I didn't think you could.
           ____________________________________
           Mario jumps on the other chandelier.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Oh! Feisty little fellow, aren't you?
           But this is the end of the line.

           Now you've got to deal with ME!
           EN GARDE!

______________________________________________________________________________
They battle. Mario's party wins.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Boomer     : Argh! This is absurd! I CAN'T be defeated by THEM! I won't let
             this happen! I won't fall in battle...

             Gasp...cough...hack...H...having an attack...gasp...

             I don't need your sympathy! I am a soldier...
             I am prepared to...go...

             Take a dive, Chandeli-ho!

Chandeli-ho: Yeoouuch!!

______________________________________________________________________________
The chandelier Boomer's standing on falls.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Boomer     : See ya later, kids!

Chandeli-ho: Boomer! Oh, poor Boomer! But not to worry! A little fall isn't
             gonna hurt you!

             All right, Mario! I'll lead you to the top! We must hurry to the
             appointed place!

             Hang on tight! And away we go!

______________________________________________________________________________
The party does a cute little stupid dance act as they go towards the top of
the Keep, riding the top of the chandelier.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Chandeli-ho: Increasing speed...!

             Next stop, the top floor! Please fasten your seatbelts and...
             Wait a sec! There ARE no seatbelts!

______________________________________________________________________________
As the chandelier suddenly stops, the party gets thrown to the top of the Keep
where they meet Exor the giant sword. They battle, Mario's party wins.

Cinematic: Exor's mouth opens up and sucks the party in to the machine world.

Geno     : Do you know where this leads to?

           It looks like Exor's the contact between two worlds.

           In other words......

           If we follow this road, we'll find Smithy.

           So...what's keeping us?

Bowser   : Hang on!

           Hey! I only joined so that I could get my castle back. I'm not going
           to be dragged along on this stupid hunt.

           This is as far as I go.

           I'm going to gather my troops and rebuild my castle.

           And you, Mario! You're an official member of the Koopa Troop. It's
           your duty to help with the repairs!

Geno     : Bowser, you're completely missing the point.

Bowser   : Gwaa?!

           I oughtta rip your stuffing out!

Geno     : No, think about it, Bowser. This sword connects the two worlds,
           right?

Bowser   : Yeah, so?

Geno     : Even IF we defeat Exor...There will be OTHER weapon beasts to
           follow him.

           Your castle is at the entrance point to YOUR world. In short...
           they'll be back!

           Is that what you want?

Bowser   : Um....well...

           (More weapon things coming to take over my castle? What about my
           ....

           ....PRIVACY?

           Yikes....
                    This isn't good at all....
                                              In fact, this stinks!....)

           (But I CAN'T just be pals with these cretins. I've got an image to
           keep up.)

           Um....well...

           (I've got it!)

           No one insults the Koopa Troop and gets away with it.

           I've got a bone to pick with this Smithy guy!

           Come on, Mario! We'll teach him a lesson.

           (I'm so sly!)

Geno     : It looks like we're together on this one. Let's go!

Countdown: It's &quot;Mario&quot;!

           How did he get here?!

           We better do something!

They battle. Mario's party wins.

before in mass production.

Moving further, they meet another pair of bosses.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Clerk    : Production is on schedule?

           This, despite the fact that Mack, Bowyer, Yaridovich, and the Axem
           Rangers were defeated.
           At this rate, Smithy will have a new army in no time!

Mallow   : A...new army?

           You can't be making more weapons! Haven't you caused enough trouble
           already?

Clerk    : Oh yeah?! Who are you?

Mallow   : This is THE Mario!

           Give up now, while you still have a chance!

           Shut down production NOW, or he'll...STOMP ya!

Clerk    : What did you say, you little puff ball? Mad Mallet! TRASH 'em!*

           All right, let's see whatcha got!*

Mallow   : Ha! Hope you learned your lesson!

           We're almost there, Mario. Come on!

______________________________________________________________________________
They move forward and see a green switch.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mallow   : What do you suppose this switch does? Hmm...

           ......Nothing's happening.

           Huh? What's with the funny face, Mario?

           Oh I KNOW, you're trying to make me look, aren't you? I'm not going
           to fall for that one!

           Ack! Help me Mario!

Mario    : (jumps)

Mallow   : Boy, that was scary! I guess the green switch controls the crane.

Toad     : Mario!

           (gasping) Phew, I......finally made it up here...

           Let me help you guys out!

           P..Princess!

Toadstool: I'm sorry I snuck out without telling you or the Chancellor.

           I just wanted things to get back to normal. I wanted to do my part
           to help...

Toad     : ...Princess...

           Yes! That's it! Any job that lets me help both Mario and the
           Princess is worthwhile!

Toadstool: You're gonna help BOTH of us?

Toad     : Well, I carried all I could! Now, what could you use?

______________________________________________________________________________
Toad sets up a store for the stuff they need, if any.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toad     : This is for you.

           [Received &quot;Rock Candy&quot;!]

Toadstool: Thank you, Toad.

Toad     : We're almost there! Come on! Let's show 'em!

In the next room... this is where the Drill Bits on the right are painted.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Pounder  : Here's the report!

Pounder 1: Sir! &quot;Drill Bit&quot; will be finished on time.

Pounder 2: We're ahead of schedule!

Pounder 3: We'll make Smithy proud!

Manager  : Good work, everyone. The harder we work, the stronger Smithy will
           become!

           The weapons we manufacture here will be...

           Just think of it...

           When Smithy takes over Mario's world, we can do anything we want!

           Nya ha ha.

           Gwah, ha, ha...

           Heh heh heh...

Bowser   : Not so fast! You sure are a cocky bunch!

           I rule this world! Don't you forget it!

Manager  : It's Mario! Mack 2 and Yaridovich 2 didn't stop him?

Bowser   : No, NO! Leave Mario outta this. I'm the one you need to worry
           about, not him!

Manager  : Mario, you're about to make the longest jump of your life!

Bowser   : You're ignoring me!*

           Um....well...

           Like the moon over
           the day, my genius and brawn
           are lost on these fools. ~Haiku

In the next room... this is where the Drill Bits are hammered.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Toadstool: You there! Are you the one in charge here?

           Do you know what your weapons have been doing to our world?

           Stop this nonsense at once!

Director : I'm afraid that isn't possible.

           Any dissent against Smithy will be dealt with by immediate meltdown.

Toadstool: M, melt down?

           You can't scare me, I've got Mario by my side!

Director : Dissenters will be eliminated! Production will continue.*

Toadstool: That was scary!

           But we can't run away now. We've got to kick these lowlifes out of
           our world.

______________________________________________________________________________
In the next room... this is where the Drill Bits are fresh from the machine.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Factory Chief: Mario! I'm surprised to see you here.

               But this is the end of the line for you. This is the closest
               you'll ever get to Smithy, so savor the moment.

               Harrumph! You'll be fodder for my incredible invention, the
               &quot;Gunyolk&quot;!*

Geno         : Hmm...... The production line hasn't halted.

               Look Mario, this is where the weapons come from.

               This must be where Smithy makes his weapons.

               To find the last Star Piece and stop the factory, we've got to
               defeat him first.

Geno         : Mario... There's no turning back now. Are you ready?

Mario        : (nod)

Geno         : Our quest is almost over.

               And when the time comes......

               Come on! Let's get this show on the road.

______________________________________________________________________________
Scene: Mario jumps on the nearby green switch, which causes a crane to pick
them up and bring them to Smithy himself. Smithy is the final boss of the game
and the Star Piece they're looking for is stuck right on Smithy's chest.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Mallow   : Hey! There's the last Star Piece!

Smithy   : Huh...?

           Already finished your tour of the factory, huh?! All right, then!
           How about a little demonstration?

Geno     : Yo Smithy!
           Stop making those things and hand over the Star Piece, NOW!

Mario    : (jump jump)

Smithy   : Huh?...Gufaw haw haw!

           So YOU'RE...Mario?! Looks like we're gonna have a little dispute
           over the star.

Bowser   : Just hand it over and GET OUTTA MY CASTLE!

Smithy   : My, my! We're a little touchy today, aren't we? You know, I'm
           actually growing rather FOND of this place...

Toadstool: Please! Don't make us go through any more!
           Just give us the star....NOW!

Smithy   : Hurrumph! Better yet...

           Why don't YOU give me YOUR stars. Why, then I could easily conquer
           this world! Then we could get rid of all wishes, and create a world
           filled with...WEAPONS!!

           Over here, NOW! I'll crush you ALL!!!

______________________________________________________________________________
They battle. Mario's party wins.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Smithy   : NOOOOOOOOOOOO...!!!

Aero     : Calm down, Smithy! Your head looks like a geyser!!

Drill Bit: Don't get so worked up! Think of your blood pressure!

Shyster  : We just built this yesterday, and the foundation's very weak.

           So...STOP SHAKING THE FLOOR!

Smithy   : How utterly annoying!
           ____________________________________________________________________
           Smithy's continuous shaking and hammering led the floor to collapse.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Huh?! What the...?! How in the heck...?!
           __________________________________________________________
           They all fell into what looks like the machine underworld.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           NOOOOOOOOOOOO...!!!

           Uwoooooooo... I'm burning...seething...

           Never have I been so wronged...

           It is time... I will show you my real form...

           I will show you my true power... I will teach you respect...

           And I shall have my revenge...

           NOOOOOOOOOOOO...!!!
           _____________________________________________________
           With a flash light, Smithy morphs into his true form!
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Guooooooo!!!!!

           Come on, you puny ants!

______________________________________________________________________________
They battle. Mario's party wins.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Smithy   : Guooooooo!!!!!

           My b...body and head are burning! It's not...possible...!

           I don't believe it...! I'm...finished...done for...!

           Guooooooooo...noooooo...!

______________________________________________________________________________
Scene: A few moments after those last words, a huge explosion occured and
Smithy was no more. The yellow star nwow floats over where he used to be.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Geno     : Come on, Mario! Send the last one way up high!

______________________________________________________________________________
Cinematic: The yellow star rises up and spins around Mario, landing on his
hands. The party now has all of the Star Pieces!
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Geno     : Thank you, everyone!

           The Star Road is back to normal! And...

______________________________________________________________________________
The Star Pieces starts to circle Geno, and a beam of light starts to radiate
from him. Just after the light became too much and faded out, Geno's body
once again become the lifeless doll it was before.

But the party was not to be lonely. After all, the Geno they know has always
been a star. He plays with them for awhile, but after those moments, he shot
to the sky and presented the Star Pieces before he fulfills his job of
repairing them.

On the other hand, from above Geno watches the giant sword vanish into dust,
and darkness lift to give way to the day, as the party and his empty body
witnesses it all from Vista Hill.

And now the patched Star Road rests way up in the heavens, and the process
of granting wishes resumes...

 - Mallow reunited with his parents, and now holds his righteous title as
   Prince of Nimbus Land.
 - Bowser reclaimed his Keep, and now repairs it back to the home it was.
 - Jonathan &quot;Johnny&quot; Jones could now breath over water.
 - Yoshi could now run faster, even outspeeding the famous bandit Croco in the
   Mushroom Derby.
 - Toadofsky the musician found out the right notes to his composition, and now
   teaches music to others.
 - Booster found his true love, in the form of Valentina. They're now getting
   married at the Marrymore Chapel.
 - All is well in the Mushroom Kingdom, and Mario, Toadstool, Toad, Yoshi, and
   the Chancellor waves &quot;THANK YOU&quot; to the audience.

After the parade, Geno passes by to see hello one more time to Mario and the
Princess. Slowly, the camera rises up into the clear dark night (if you had
fireworks, then they start firing up here), then follows Geno as he zooms all

Sidequest Scripts\____________________________________________________________

This part contains what I said was the unnecessary parts of the game. They do
not affect the plot one little bit, but they sure are fun to read. I know,
it's anticlimactic to post these stuff AFTER finishing the story, but posting
them in the middle wouldn't make much sense either, would it? To find out
how to access these sidequests, check Astroblue's FAQ, it has everything you'd
want in SMRPG. (except maybe Link and Samus codes, since they don't exist =P)

Jagger   : Who is it? Sorry, but the Sensei isn't in.

           Oh my gosh!

Bowser   : Jagger?!

Jagger   : Bowser! I haven't seen you for so long.

           I've been studying here at the dojo under the Sensei &quot;Jinx&quot; because
           ... To tell you the truth, I...I knew I couldn't beat Smithy.

           That's why I'm here now. Someday I'm going to return and make you
           proud!

Bowser   : ....Don't worry about me.

           I've got new Troopas now, and we're going to take back my castle.

           You stick to my guns!
           Train like there's no tomorrow!

Jagger   : My Sensei is out right now, but he'll be back shortly.

           In the meantime, will you accept a challenge from me?

           :: (No)

           Wow! I'm flattered to think that YOU'RE afraid of me.

           :: (Sure)

           Great! You know that I'm not going to make it easy for you, right?

______________________________________________________________________________
They battle. Mario's party wins.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Jagger   : Yikes! I guess that was to be expected.

           Mario, you're a top-notch fighter!

???      : You did well for your inexperience, Jagger.

______________________________________________________________________________
Jagger looks around and finds his Sensei hiding in a plant. By the way, Sensei
Jinx is a really small martial artist, about less than half of Mario's height
and width.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Jagger   : Sensei! Have you been here all along?

Jinx     : Hmmm. You felt my Ki, didn't you? Not bad for a novice!
           _________________________________________
           Jinx suddenly reappeared at Mario's back.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Your fighting style...It isn't as foolproof as you think.
           ______________________________________________
           Then he teleports back to his former position.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           I'll accept a challenge any day.

Jagger   : Now this should be interesting. Can you beat THE master, Mario?

Jinx     : You wish to challenge me?

           :: (No)

           Tsk tsk. Afraid are we?

           :: (Yes)

           All right. Let's see what you're capable of.

______________________________________________________________________________
They battle. Mario's party wins.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Jinx     : I guess I underestimated you. You pack quite a punch!

           But don't let it go to your head, because I let you HAVE that round.
           Let's have a rematch.

           :: (Yes)

           All right, you asked for it. And no crying if you get hurt!

______________________________________________________________________________
They rematch. Mario's party wins.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Jinx     : Still haven't had enough?

           It isn't often that I have someone this competitive to spar with!

           All right, this match will be the one that counts, since I'm placing
           my reputation on the line!

           :: (Yes)

           Watch closely, Jagger. You're about to see your Sensei in action.

______________________________________________________________________________
They rematch. Mario's party wins.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Jinx     : Whoa......
           You ARE the stronger champion, no doubt about it.

           My reputation was staked on this last fight, so I've lost the title
           of &quot;Sensei&quot;.

           From today, you are the Sensei of this dojo.

           Please take this belt, which only the highest ranking fighter in
           the dojo can wear.

           [Received a &quot;Jinx Belt&quot;]

           We will rename the dojo, &quot;Mario Style Dojo&quot;, and incorporate your
           jump technique into the training.

______________________________________________________________________________
Jinx goes out and nails a new sign in front of the dojo, from the letter &quot;J&quot;
for Jinx, it's now &quot;M&quot; for Mario.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Jinx     : Jagger and I will start our training immediately.

           1000 warm up jumps! Ready, begin!

Jagger   : Mario Sensei, the new regimen will strengthen us, right?

Jinx     : Master! Share your wisdom with us!

Rat      : I've been all around the world.

           But the strangest person I met, is this old geezer in Rose Town.

           He really is weird, but definitely worth meeting.

______________________________________________________________________________
And so the party goes to Rose Town, and searches for the weird elder.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Gardener : Hi, I'm the gardener. See that huge planter?

           I've spent many years seeking the legendary &quot;Seed&quot; and &quot;Fertilizer&quot;
           to fill it with, but had no luck.

           Sigh...if I could only find them!

______________________________________________________________________________
If you have either the Seed or the Fertilizer, the music accelerates and the
Gardener will start talking about these stuff so FAST in such a rate that
you must see it yourself for the humor to REALLY set in. Anyway, here it goes:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
__________________________
&gt;&gt; If you have the Seed &gt;&gt;
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Gardener  : Incredible! I can't believe it! It's the legendary &quot;Seed&quot; I've
            read about in the ancient gardening texts. These are so rare! Can
            you even begin to comprehend what a huge discovery this is? I've
            spent my whole life searching for one! It's too much, I tell ya!

Mario     : (spins around and faints)

Gardener  : Hey! I haven't finished yet.

            Well, that's my story.
            Say...will you give me the &quot;Seed&quot;?

            :: (Sure)

            I finally have it! This is extraordinary!

            :: (Nope)

            Gals don't care for tightwads, you know!

________________________________
&gt;&gt; If you have the Fertilizer &gt;&gt;
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Gardener  : Egads! Do you know what you have there? That fertilizer comes from
            the Shy Away clan, famous for its miraculous feats of gardening. I
            looked for it beyond the cliffs, even tried Bean Valley, but
            failed. I've traveled around the world and waited a lifetime for
            some of that fertilizer you've got there!

Mario     : (spins around and faints)

Gardener  : Short attention span?

            Yes, you might say I have fertilizer on the brain. Will you give
            it to me?

            :: (Sure)

            I finally have it! But without the &quot;Seed&quot;, it's useless.

            :: (Nope)

            Sigh...What ever happened to granting an old man's wishes?

_____________________________________________________________________
&gt;&gt; If you have given the Gardener both the Seed and the Fertilizer &gt;&gt;
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Gardener : Oh thank you! I finally have both the &quot;Seed&quot; and the &quot;Fertilizer&quot;.
           I'll try them out right away.

           I'll plant the seed...

           Then give it fertilizer.

           ......Nothing's happening.

______________________________________________________________________________
After a few moments, a giant beanstalk very much like what Mario climbed at
Bean Valley sprouts from the planter.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Gardener : W....wow! This is amazing!

           This is unreal! This is just like winning the lottery, only without
           the taxes! I mean, this is like falling out of an airplane without
           a parachute, and hitting a gaggle of geese in mid-air who break your
           fall. Wait until my buddies over at Happy Gardener's Monthly hear
           about this. I'm going to be famous! Maybe even get my picture in the
           next issue.

           You think it could use a little more fertilizer?

Mario    : (spins around and faints)

Gardener : Oops, maybe not, huh?

______________________________________________________________________________
On the top of the beanstalk are the Lazy Shells, which are the most powerful</pre><pre id="faqspan-5">
weapon and armor in the whole game.

                             -the culex scripts-

-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯-_-¯


Piranha  : It's really weird. Sometimes I hear the guy next door.

           He's always mumbling about a Crystal-this and an Evil-that.

           Isn't a &quot;Crystal&quot; some kind of a shiny rock...or something? I know
           I've seen those somewhere!

______________________________________
&gt;&gt; If the party has the Shiny Stone &gt;&gt;
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[It's been sealed]

[Look! The &quot;Shiny Stone&quot; is reacting!]

[The seal has been broken!]

______________________________________________________________________________
The party now enters the unlocked door. Once inside, they end up in some sort
of a chaotic dimension, and another creature is slowly walking towards them.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Culex    : Greetings.

           I am Culex, Dark Knight of Vanda.

           I have crossed into this dimension to fight for the Dark Mage.

           But this world is uninhabitable for me and my kind. I must return
           to my own world.

           Before I go, though, I would like to challenge your strongest knight.

           Will you accept my challenge?

           You will enter combat against me?

           :: (Uh...)

           You are wise to hesitate.

           Without any weapon or armor*, you have no chance.

           :: (Yes)

           En garde!

______________________________________________________________________________
*In a subtle way, Culex tells you of the Lazy Shells. Also, don't you think
it's funny that the best armor in the game, the Super Suit, is found right
next to Culex's room? I'm curious on what this guy has been doing here...

The party takes the challenge and they battle.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Culex    : I am matter... I am antimatter...

           I can see your past... I can see your future...

           I consume time... And I will consume you!

______________________________________________________________________________
Culex is accompanied by his four elemental crystals, all of which cast highly
damaging spells. His sprite is 2D, and the battle music is that of the FF4
bosses. Even the victory and post-battle music is of the FF variety. This has
led some players to believe that Culex came from an FF game. I am against this
belief though. I have searched most of the in-game script and it simply doesn't
specifically say anything about his presence in other games. Also, to the best
of my gaming knowledge, all the other RPGs made by Square doesn't show any
sign of Culex.

After a long and hard battle, Mario's party wins.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Culex    : Ahhhh!
           Your spirit........is strong!

           Thank you, brave knight.

           I will treasure this memento of my journey here.

           Perhaps in another time, another game, we may have been mortal
           enemies...

           Let us part as comrades in arms.

           Take this.
           Treasure it as a keepsake of our fight.

           [Received a &quot;Quartz Charm&quot;!]

           Farewell, champion knight!

______________________________________________________________________________
And then Culex walks away happily, and the party gets transported back to
their world, with the door sealing and vanishing behind them.
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
