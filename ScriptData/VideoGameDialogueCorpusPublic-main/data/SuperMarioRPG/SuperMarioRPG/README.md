# Super Mario RPG

## Source

The source doesn't cover all skippable dialogue, so some minor NPC speech isn't captured.

In the source, [ ] is used to denote on-screen text from the (unvoiced) narrator. As a result, some lines coded as 'action' look like dialogue (e.g. "You never know! It might come in handy!"), however this is deliberate. 

## Gender Coding

Revisions to previously neutral characters as follows: 

"Knife Guy" refers to "Grate Guy" as brother in the script, and they are listed as brothers in the wiki, so I have coded them as male. 

"Gardener" refers to himself as an 'old man' in the script. 

"Altogether" and "Axem Rangers" both denote all the Axem characters, so I've added that these as aliases. 

"Bus Driver" has a large moustache and is referred to as male in the mario wiki (https://www.mariowiki.com/Royal_Bus_driver). 

"Repair Man" (visible at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu_b0qu1U5U 0:14) uses the avatar called 'Nimbus Guard' (see https://www.mariowiki.com/Nimbus). He has the same head as the 'Nimbus Man' avatars (noticeably different from the "Nimbus Woman" avatars) so I have coded him as male. 

"Spring Guard" is possibly male (if they use the Nimbus Guard avatar) but I couldn't readily track down the character in-game so have left as neutral. 

It isn't clear which constellation of characters is referred to by "party" in its two instances, so I've left that as neutral rather than splitting out as an alias (likewise for "Everybody"). 

"Retainer" is a standard toad, so I've left neutral. 

"Guard", "Guard 1" and "Guard 2" refer to Valentina's minions, and aren't of any apparent gender (so I've left neutral). 

"Jump Girl" is a pink-headed toad (like toadette) wearing a dress, so I've coded as 'female'. 

"Manager" is an elderly toad with a spotted black cap and a long white beard and moustache - I've coded as 'male'.  

"Chefs" and "Both" refer collectively to "Chef Torte" and "Apprentice" - I've added an alias for each.
