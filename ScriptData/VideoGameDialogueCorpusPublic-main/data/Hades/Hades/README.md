## Gender Coding

Although "Bouldy" is a boulder, Sisyphus refers to Bouldy throughout using male pronouns, and Zagreus echoes this. Coded male accordingly. 

"Chaos" has been moved from "neutral" to explicitly "genderless", based on the they/them pronouns, voice acting (which was blended), and Nyx describing them as both mother and father.
