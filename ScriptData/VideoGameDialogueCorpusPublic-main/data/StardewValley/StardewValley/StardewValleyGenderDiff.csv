Alex,Male,"Hey, farmer guy. You look a little burnt.",Hey Farmer girl. You've got a nice tan going.,41,45,21,Gender-specific flirting,Flirts with female. This is weird. Why is a tan nice on a girl but not on a guy?

Penny,Female,...I'll always remember this night.,You look so beautiful tonight... I... *gasp*,35,44,39,Gender-specific flirting,"Seemingly flirting with both genders; not clear out-of-context, but does so differently. Mild perpetuation: associating female with beauty. "

Elliott,Male,We'd better head back before the southern wind picks up.,Uh oh... The vibration from your body has caught the attention of a Crimsonfish... We'd better get out of here.,56,111,88,Perpetuate,Possible trope: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterMisogyny.

Leah,Female,@'s a better man than you in every respect!,@'s a better person than you in every respect!,43,46,5,Perpetuate,"Presumably the person being compared to is also a man, but it's interesting that they've defaulted to a 'better man' when possible, rather than just using 'better person' for both. It's possible that they wrote the dialogue for a male PC first (Male as Default) and then amended for a female PC."
Penny,Female,He has first-hand experience living in the countryside... so he knows all about the valley's 'natural resources'!,She has first-hand experience living in the countryside... so she knows all about the valley's 'natural resources'!,113,115,3,Neutral,

Sebastian,Male,"Hey... Maybe I'll let you ride sometime, if you want.",Hey... maybe I'll take you for a ride some day.,53,47,25,Perpetuate,"Men Act, Women Are. The male character is permitted to 'ride', the female character is offered a more passive role. "

Elliott,Male,"Bartender! Two of your finest ales, please!",Bartender! Fetch me your finest ale. And bring some wine for the lady!,43,70,37,Perpetuate,"Ale for boys, wine for girls. Classic stereotype. "
Gus,Male,"Oh, Hello there, buddy.","Hi, @.",23,6,19,Neutral,"There are various possible implications here, but it's hard to tell out of context. It could be innocuous, it could imply that only men can be your pal, it could be suggestive of gender-specific flirting (such that the NPC doesn't want to label the female PC a 'friend'). Without more details, I'm calling it neutral. "
