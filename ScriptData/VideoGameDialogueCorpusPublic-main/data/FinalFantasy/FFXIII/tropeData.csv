That would be horrendously impractical *and* easily ruined for any physical weapon; combined with the fact that it must be assumed the weapon is spring-loaded or something in order to give it any propulsion at *all*, which would be significantly weaker than a proper longbow, and Rule of Cool (or [A Wizard Did It](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt)) is the only excuse the weapon has for its design.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool

../data/FinalFantasy/FFXIII/,Final Fantasy XIII,Lightning,Lightning,The Heroine,0," [The Heroine](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeroine): While her main motive for helping God save the souls' of humans is to save Serah, she still generally displays quite a lot of heroism throughout her quest, moreso than she ever has before - from helping anyone in need to encouraging anyone having a difficult time, and even making occasional quotes in battle such as ""I fight to give people hope!"" and ""Evil has a price!"". Fairly justified in that doing so helps her power grow.  (SPOILER)  By the end of the game, she's undoubtedly a true heroine, risking everything to face the most powerful evil God in the universe to give all people a chance in the new world.

This is the case even against monsters that she previously needed teammates to beat.  (SPOILER) Bhunivelze himself was grooming her to take the place of Etro, a goddess, so her power in that regard is understandable. ",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero

The *X-2* Yuna cosplay garb and the Miqo'te cosplay garb are also notable in this regard, but there's plenty more as well, some even being bikini styled. It's also worth noting that most of her sexier outfits (such as Electronia, Witching Hour, Amazon Warrior, Rhapsody in Rose, etc.) have better stats than the other ones, further encouraging players to wear them. Even her default Equilibrium garb boils down to being a leather leotard with thigh-high boots with a cape and skirt pieces trailing behind her.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice

Weapons classified as greatswords (such as the Buster Sword or Chaos' Revenge) having her wield them one-handed while idling, but putting both hands on the grip when she is actually attacking. That being said, much like the Warrior of Light in *[Dissidia Final Fantasy](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy)*, several of her one-handed swords qualify as zweihänders by proportions, but go one-handed in the same game that features the Buster Sword.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHandedZweihander
