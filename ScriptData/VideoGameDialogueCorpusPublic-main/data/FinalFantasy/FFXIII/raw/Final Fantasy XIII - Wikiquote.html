<ul><li>The public fears what it doesn't know... Strike down the phantoms before their eyes, and they sleep like babes.</li>
<li>A l'Cie tied to an inescapable Focus - a slave of destiny. I'd lost hope. I'd all but given up dreams of freedom.</li>
<li>When it comes to Pulse, who could claim to know anything? I need the truth, for the sake of Cocoon.</li>
<li>The public fears what it doesn't know. It's grown tired of living in constant terror of these treats from the world below. So, the Sanctum devised a plan for you l'Cie.</li>
<li>I put you on the path. That was my Focus.</li>
<li>I did my best to assist you as bid by the Sanctum fal'Cie.</li>
<li>A shadow of a dream from when I was human. It was change I craved, and once I'd built the influence to make things happen, there was change. I gained all the power I could hope for, but was a puppet with no will to wield it. It wasn't the fal'Cie that changed, it was me.</li>
<li>I'm here of my own accord, not by fal'Cie. Seeing you fight brought it all back. Brought back that future I once strove for. I, too, will challenge my fate.</li>
<li>I will set you free!</li>
<li>The only thing I wanted was a moment of triumph. How it ends isn't important. Just do what you know is right. Trust yourselves.</li>
<li>People of Cocoon. My fellow citizens. We have survived the twilight, and gather now to welcome the dawn on which we decide our fate. Many are lessons we have learned during our long night of hardship and sacrifice. And now we face choices, which must be made as our hearts dictate, and not abandoned to uncared chance, Let us forge ahead with unflinching courage and honor the fallen with action. With these hands we shape the future.</li></ul>

<ul><li>(to reporter) There's no denying the enormity of the strain the Purge placed on us all. But, given the tens of millions of lives at stake, there truly was no alternative.</li>
<li>(to public) In all the centuries since the War of Transgression, Cocoon has been spared Pulse aggression, and prospered for it. It is essential that we maintain this peace. That is the Sanctum's focus. We will continue employing every resource available to combat these threats to the harmony of our society.</li>
<li>What else does one do with tools?</li>
<li>Without our help, death is all of which you're capable. You saw the fools. A mindless mob drunk on fear of a few l'Cie.</li>
<li>l'Cie? You mean me? Oh child, perish the thought. I am more than that! [Assumes true form] I am fal'Cie. My name is Barthandelus. Voice of the Sanctum and Lord-Sovereign of the Cocoon fal'Cie. Your kind feared the darkness, so we gave you light. You begged us for the Purge. and did it not come to pass? Now your spurn our counsel? You must learn your place!</li>
<li>Will you enjoy the festivities beside me or perhaps... (turns into fal'Cie form) Greet the end here in the land where it all began (Oerba)?</li>
<li>If you truly seek salvation, you will obey!</li>
<li>Fight
<ul><li>This is the power of a fal'Cie.</li>
<li>Come...</li>
<li>What can mere l'Cie do?</li>
<li>You are ignorant of your place.</li>

<ul><li>A haven, yea. Yet it must fall ere we be saved. Too frail a shell, and humans should not thrive. Too stout a shell and they would not die. Slaughter and salvation! Two irreconcilable Focuses we bore. Yet bound were we in a cocoon prison, impervious to our power. And so we thank you for granting us our longed-for birth. We are the Abandoned One, born but now to die. Our name is Orphan. By our hand, the world shall know redemption.</li>
<li>Have you ever paused to consider our reason for making l'Cie of men? We fal'Cie are crafted for a single purpose and granted finite power to that end. With men it is not so. Men dream, aspire, and through indomitable force of will achieve the impossible. Your power is beyond measure.</li></ul>

<li><b>Fang</b>: What's it matter? You want to become a monster?</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: I just—</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>: Keep your chin up. We know the part that matters. Right? We are enemies of Cocoon. Know what I say? Play the part and raise hell. Might jump-start our memories.</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: What?</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>: The fal'Cie. Let's smash it.</li></ul>
<p>---
</p>
<ul><li><b>Vanille</b>: Let's give up! Forget our Focus, we don't need it!</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>: We don't need it? Look, if we don't figure it out and pull it off, you're gonna become a Cie'th.</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: It's just--making a kid a that young l'Cie. It's not right!</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>: Yeah, it's unfair. But guess what? We grin and bear it like good l'Cie or the fal'Cie starts making more. Like that girl the other day. It doesn't matter what our Focus is. We do out, whether we like it or not.</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: But--</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>: Say we call it quits. You think these people will let us go? They'll lynch us on the street. Listen, Vanille. We do what we've gotta do and get ourselves off this filthy world, as fast as we can.</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: Fang?</li>

<ul><li><b>Snow</b>: Serah! What is your Focus? L'Cie have a Focus, right? I'll go with you. Help you do it. Just let me.</li>
<li><b>Serah</b>: No! If you're with me, the Sanctum will--</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: I will be with you! No matter what! We've come to far to quit now.</li>
<li><b>Serah</b>: I don't know. I don't know my Focus. I'm gonna be a monster.</li>

<li><b>Serah</b>: Okay.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Serah</b>: If it's true what they say...When we're finished, I'll turn to crystal.</li>

</p>
<dl><dd>Four Days Prior</dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Serah</b>: Don't laugh, okay? It's a dream I had, a bad one. I dreamed I destroyed the world. It was terrifying. I needed some time alone. It had me so scared I tried to run away. But then, my boyfriend, he came chasing after me. That's when I understood. Running away and leaving behind the people you care about? That isn't love. Though you might just want to keep them safe, shutting them out of you life only hurts them more. The point is, I have people I can count on. I'll make it through.</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: I think you'll be fine.</li>
<li><b>Serah</b>: You will be too. You'll find the words, I'm sure of it.</li></ul>

<dl><dd>Two Days Prior</dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Snow</b>: Making a wish?</li>
<li><b>Serah</b>: Maybe I was. I was hoping that tomorrow I can tell my sister. She'll be so mad, knowing I hid it from her.</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: Don't worry, I'll take the blame for you. You know, you should ask for something bigger. These are wish-granting fireworks like in the stories.</li>
<li><b>Serah</b>: Stories, huh? L'Cie who fulfill their Focus...they become crystal and gain eternal life.</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: Would help if they gave you some clue about what you're suppose to do. We'll figure this thing out...You will never be one of those monsters.</li>
<li><b>Serah</b>: So what will I be? A crystal?</li></ul>
<dl><dd>[She starts crying until Snow takes out a necklace]</dd></dl>

Oh, man There's no way to turn a l'Cie back into human. Even if she completes her Focus, there's no changing her fate. She'll live her life as a fal'Cie slave. Don't make her suffer.</li>

<li><b>Snow</b>: Serah. She said to protect to Cocoon, and then she turned to crystal. That's the proof right there. She completed her Focus! That means ours is to save Cocoon. Serah's fal'Cie is the same as ours. Our Focus has got be the same. We were chosen to be guardians, to defeat Ragnarok! It makes sense!</li>
<li><b>Sazh</b>: The hell it does! You're grasping at straws, son! Pulse fal'Cie are Cocoon's enemies. We just got recruited by one of them. If I were a betting man...I'd put us on the other side.</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: So Serah's an enemy too? Well I don't buy it! We have the power to save Cocoon. If we work together and carry out out Focus---</li></ul>

</p>
<ul><li><b>Sazh</b>: I thought they'd be tougher than that. These guys are PSICOM, yeah? Supposed to be cream-of-the-crop.</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: Yeah, but PSICOM's an anti-Pulse task force. Haven't fought a war in centuries. Bunch of rookie troops swinging around overpriced toys.</li>
<li><b>Sazh</b>: So, from what you're telling me, it sounds like a regular old soldier...has got more training than special forces.</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: Nothing for us l'Cie to be afraid of.</li>
<li><b>Lightning</b>: Cut the crap. Their grunts might be green, but PSICOM's elites are cold-blooded beasts. They hit the field and it's game over.</li></ul>

<li><b>Snow</b>: So I just abandon her, and save myself?</li>
<li><b>Lightning</b>: What about our focus? What happened to banding together to save the world? It's that what you promised? Now you want to forget it all and die here? Snow? You're nothing but talk.</li>

<li><b>Sazh</b>: This isn't a game!</li>
<li><b>Lightning</b>: No. That's for damn sure. It started with Serah. The fal'Cie took her. Now I'm a l'Cie. And the Sanctum's hunting me, an enemy of the state. But who's pulling their strings? A fal'Cie. Eden. Cocoon's sustainer and guiding light. It probably ordered the Purge, too. Pulse and Sanctum fal'Cie? They're all the same. And we're all the same to them: expendable. I'm not dying a fal'Cie slave.</li></ul>

<li><b>Sazh</b>: Afraid of what they don't know. Afraid to find out more. Get worse the older you get. I'm terrified of what will happen. The world probably would be better off without Pulse l'Cie. I mean, most of them.</li></ul>

<li><b>Cid</b>: Those are the Sanctum's methods. The public fears what it doesn't know. It's grown tired of living in constant terror of these treats from the World below. So, the Sanctum devised a plan for you l'Cie.</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: I'll bet.</li>
<li><b>Cid</b>: A public execution. The people don't know any better. Strike down the phantoms before their eyes, and they sleep like babes.</li></ul>

<li><b>Vanille</b>: Don't blame yourself. You know, you can't control who a fal'Cie picks for its Focus.</li>
<li><b>Sazh</b>: My son Dajh. He was picked. He's a l'Cie. He said he wanted to see a fal'Cie. So, I took him on a tour of the Euride Gorge plant. Though I'd surprise him with a chocobo chick to take home, but the second I turned my back...into the energy plant he went Apparently, those Pulse l'Cie had snuck in and tried to attack the Sanctum fal'Cie.

<ul><li><b>Vanille</b>: Sazh... Do you hate Pulse?</li>
<li><b>Sazh</b>: Why wouldn't I? Look at this mess it gotten us all into! Of course, that's not to say I always hated it. Seemed fishy. All that Sanctum ranting about the 'threat from Pulse'. 'Only a matter of time before they strike'. 'Pulse is infested with monsters'. Scare after scare, and not even a shred of proof. Tired old cynics like me, we don't just swallow that tabloid crap. No, no. Not me. I figured the Sanctum was up to something crooked. At least until I got dragged into it.</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: Yeah...</li>
<li><b>Sazh</b>: Now that I think about I, all this Pulse business...it really only happened because Dajh found that Pulse fal'Cie.</li>

<ul><li><b>Hope</b>: Look at us: Pulse l'Cie, using a Sanctum fal'Cie to tell where we're going. Sort of strange.</li>
<li><b>Lightning</b>: Not really. We've relied on them our our lives. The food we eat, the light and water, it's all from the fal'Cie. You know, I think Cocoon was really built for them. The rest of us, we're just leeches. Parasites.</li>
<li><b>Hope</b>: You think? They protect us, nurture us. They take care of, well, normal people. They treat us like we're special, almost like...Like we're pets!</li>
<li><b>Lightning</b>: Like pets. To them, we are just pets. That's it. Now it makes sense. I've been so blind. I was born into a fal'Cie world, raised on a fal'Cie leash. It was the only life I know how to live. When it was taken from me, I was completely lost. Without a master to follow - my life had no purpose. Hope, listen to me. This l'Cie curse, it took everything. My future. My dreams. I didn't want to think. So I fought instead. As long as I was fighting, nothing else was real I was running away. And you, Hope... You got swept along with me.</li>

<li><b>Hope</b>: It's my name, not who I am.</li>
<li><b>Lightning</b>: I was just like you. My parents died. I have to be strong for Serah, so I thought I needed to forget my past. And I became Lightning. I thought by changing my name, I could change who I was. I was just a kid. Lightning. It flashes bright, then fades away. It can't protect. It only destroys. Serah tried to tell me, but I wouldn't listen. I threatened her. The only one who believed her was Snow.</li>
<li><b>Hope</b>: Don't say it! Don't say his name. It bring everything back. I keep playing it in my head, what happened to her. And then I see his stupid face and--and he's smiling. How can he smile when she's dead? I know! There nothing I can't do. I hate knowing that. No matter what happens, she's not coming back! When I was fighting, there was no time to think about it. It felt good just to give in. But now you start talking about hope...</li></ul>

</p>
<ul><li><b>Lightning</b>: Who are you?</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>: Where do I start? I got a few screws loose. But I'm a I'Cie, same as you. Difference being...I wasn't born on Cocoon. I'm from Grand Pulse. The 'world below' you all hate so much. My partner and I'd turned to crystal there and gone to sleep. But when we came around, here we were. The reason Cocoon in such an uproar is a the same reason you're here now. Vanille and I woke up. When we came out of crystal stasis, we didn't remember our Focus or what we'd done. All we could do was wander Cocoon, looking for what we'd lost. By the time I took care of 'em, Vanille was long gone. After that, Raines and his Cavalry found me. I never stopped searching for Vanille, but I couldn't find her. Her, or our Focus.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Lightning</b>: Hey, Fang. The others are safe, right? If any of us caught, they'd make an announcement.</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>: Yeah they would. They'd have to let everyone know that the the big, bad l'Cie can't hurt 'em no more. These Cocoon people—bunch of cowards and blowhards.</li>
<li><b>Lightning</b>: 'These Cocoon people' have spent centuries under fal'Cie, in constant fear of a Pulse invasion. If it weren't for Serah, I'd have been out there too. Hunting l'Cie. Would have been nothing but targets to me.</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>: Well, Gran Pulse is just as twisted. 'Cocoon's a nest of vipers, ready to strike', or so I thought.</li></ul>

</p>
<ul><li><b>Fang</b>: Pulse and Cocoon can rot for all I care! If I don't figure out our Focus soon. Vanille's gonna be a Cie'th. I'll tear down the sky if it'll save her.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Hope</b>: I wanted to ask you something.</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: What's that?</li>
<li><b>Hope</b>: You say you want a family. What if, what if they were taken from you?</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: Well then, I'd take them back.</li>
<li><b>Hope</b>: And what if you couldn't? What if you who was to blame?</li></ul>
<p>--
</p>
<ul><li><b>Hope</b>: Snow? What do you plan to do? I need to know.</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: I told you. Save Serah, protect Cocoon, and have myself a big, happy family. Still, it's a long road ahead. Or, maybe not so long. Whatever happens, things will work out. Even if you're l'Cie, you've got to keep fighting.</li>
<li><b>Hope</b>: And what if that gets people around you involved? What happens when your actions end up ruining someone's life? What if someone dies? What then, Snow? How do you pay for what you've done?</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: I can't, all right? There is nothing that can make something like that right again. When someone dead, when someone's gone, words are useless</li>
<li><b>Hope</b>: So that's it? People die and you just run away?</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: I know! It's all my fault! But I don't know how to fix it! Where do you start? What do you say? All I can do is go forward. Keep fighting and surviving, until I find the answers I need.</li>
<li><b>Hope</b>: There are no answers! You're running from what you deserve!</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: Well, why don't you tell me what I deserve?</li>
<li><b>Hope</b>: The same fate!</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Snow</b>: (<i>to Hope</i>) I was asked to keep you safe. By Lightning. And by Nora. I'm sorry. What happened-- it was my fault. I  put her in danger. I know that. Let me make it right.</li>
<li><b>Hope</b>: You told me before that you couldn't.</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: And that words were useless, and a lot of other things I shouldn't have said. Look, I didn't know what to do, didn't know how to set things straight. So I didn't I thought if I couldn't make up for it, then all the apologies in the world wouldn't mean a thing. So I decided I had to find a way to pay for it first, before I'd even have the right to say sorry. But, it's like you said. I was using that as a excuse, so I could run from my own guilt. That hit home. Look, Hope. I know I did was my fault. I don't deny it, and I am sorry.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Vanille</b>: (<i>narrating</i>) Knowing you'll always be welcomed, no matter how much has changed...That's what having a home is all about.</li></ul>

And so it fall to me to order your execution. It's that simple. It is my responsibility to see you put down. Your lives are forfeit.</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: Aw, cut the crap! You want l'Cie, then kill l'Cie Why do other people have to die? The Purge has got to stop!</li>
<li><b>Yaag Rosch</b>: Do you think we want to Purge our own people? If any trace of Pulse remains, the populace will erupt into chaos. Without sacrifice. without the Purge, Cocoon will die!</li></ul>

<li><b>Galenth</b>: What can mere men do? Without our help, death is all of which you're capable. You saw the fools. A mindless mob drunk on fear of a few l'Cie.</li>

</p>
<ul><li><b>Galenth</b>: Allow me to help you see the truth of things. The moment you arrived, your friend wept crystal tears. That's because her Focus required that you be brought together. That girl did nothing but assemble the tools for Cocoon's destruction.</li></ul>

<li><b>Vanille</b>: You mean become Ragnarok.</li>
<li><b>Sazh</b>: Destroy the fal'Cie Eden, and shatter Cocoon. That's what the vision is telling us more or less. So, we're back to square one. Out of luck.</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: Mr. Hero! Cocoon calling Snow!</li>
<li><b>Hope</b>: It's almost like Dysley want it to come true.</li>
<li><b>Sazh</b>: Seems that way. He sure didn't mind explaining it. 'Here's you Focus on a silver platter.'</li></ul>
<p>--
</p>
<ul><li><b>Snow</b>: Hey, uh, I've got to apologize. It looks like I was wrong.</li>
<li><b>Lightning</b>: About Serah's Focus? Not like you to second-guess yourself.</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: Well, even heroes make mistakes.</li>
<li><b>Lightning</b>: What about your plan to save Cocoon? Either way, your faith in Serah was strong. That strength got you this far.</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: It was all wrong.</li>
<li><b>Lightning</b>: Yeah. You tried so hard to convince us that you even fooled yourself. You've been a total idiot. But still...It saved me. You trusted Serah. Let that faith drive you. It even made me want to believe.</li></ul>
<p>--
</p>
<ul><li><b>Vanille</b>: This place--it must be an Ark.</li>
<li><b>Lightning</b>: An Ark?</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>: That what they called 'em. Long ago, the fal'Cie who made their home on Gran Pulse were afraid of invasion from the outside. As part of their battle preparations, they created an army living weapons. And they stored those weapons in Arks, and they hide the Arks all over the world. Everyone on Gran Pulse knew the legend.</li></ul>
<p>--
</p>
<ul><li><b>Lightning</b>: Okay, so, I get it. Dysleys's goal is to forge us into stronger weapons. Right.</li>
<li><b>Sazh</b>: Not Cie'th, but monsters all the same.</li>
<li><b>Hope</b>: Think of it as training for the fight ahead.</li></ul>
<p>--
</p>
<ul><li><b>Fang</b>: (<i>auto-talk as the party moves onwards in the Ark</i>) Guess it's time to "face the peril of our plight." Sounds splendid.</li></ul>
<p>---
</p>
<ul><li><b>Snow</b>: Raines…? Easy, guys, it's all right. Raines is a Sanctum officer. He's been helping us out--</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>: Why are you here?</li>
<li><b>Lightning</b>: Raines! You traitor!</li></ul>
<dl><dd>[She attacks, but is defeated, her gunblade caught held by Raines.]</dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Cid</b>: I put you  on the path. That was my focus.</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>: You’re a l’Cie!?</li>
<li><b>Cid</b>: Since long before we met. I did my best to assist you as bid by the Sanctum fal'Cie. Now do you understand? The fal'Cie haved watched over you, guiding your every step. The 'luck' that saved you time and again was a deliberate machination. Why, you may ask? The Primarch--or should I say Barthandelus--is crafting you into the instruments of Cocoon's demise.</li></ul>
<p>--
</p>
<ul><li><b>Cid</b>: The entity responsible for creating both humans and fal’Cie. Long ago, the Maker departed the world, leaving the two races behind. In a sense, human and fal'Cie are brothers--orphaned by the same parent. As for the humans, they forgot the order imposed by the Marker. They began to war among themselves for the first time in history. The fal'Cie focused on recalling their lost deity, and returning the world to its former glory. This purpose lies in the heart of all their actions. Calling back the Maker requires a fitting sacrifice.</li>
<li><b>Lightning</b>: Yeah, we've heard. The destruction of Cocoon.</li></ul>
<p>--
</p>
<ul><li><b>Lightning</b>: Raines….</li>
<li><b>Cid</b>: Ironic, isn't it? The only thing I wanted was a moment of triumph. How it ends isn't important. Just do what you know is right. Trust yourselves.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>[crystallizes.]</dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Sazh</b>: What? Did he complete his focus?</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: I don't think so. All Raines did was try to save Cocoon in his way. His own way!</li></ul>
<dl><dd>[Snow storms off as Cid is teleported,]</dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Vanille</b>: (<i>narrating</i>) I think Raines was searching--searching for a way to make us understand. To understand the frustration of being a l'Cie---a l'Cie bound to a Focus. And maybe... what it meant to be human.</li></ul>
<p>--
</p>
<ul><li><b>Sazh</b>: I have enough of this! Where's the way out!?</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: Way out? Who said there was one? Bring it on. My mind is made up.Maybe I will end up a Cie'th. But until rake happens, I'm gonna make Serah proud. I couldn't bring myself to admit that this tear meant good-bye. And that's why I kept searching for her. But I didn't need to. Serah was here the whole time. Right here, watching over me, Now I get it. What this tear's been telling me is to not let our Focus win.It's not the fal'Cie we should listen to. It's Serah, and Raines. Do you know why? Because our Focus doesn't matter! What matter to me is that we protect Cocoon, whatever it takes!</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: Same here. I'll help you do it.</li>
<li><b>Hope</b>: All right. I'm in.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>[Sazh and Lightning also join in.]</dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Fang</b>: Well, count me out. If you all want to go it on your own...Then so will I!</li></ul>
<dl><dd>[She assumes a fighting stance.]</dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Fang</b>: Let Cocoon gets what's coming. They hate us for being l'Cie. What's it to me if they die? Better that than watch a friend go Cie'th! If you don't have the nerve for it, I'll do it myself. Go on alone, get stronger, and smash Cocoon out of the sky!</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: Fang?</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>: (as her mark reacts) You turn Cie'th, and there's no coming back! I'm not...letting it end that way.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>[Bahamut emerges]</dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Fang</b>: What's he doing here? Come to take pity on me? Come to take care of a broken l'Cie?</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: That thing's here to help us?</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>: Yeah, 'help.' That's what Eidolons do, they help us. Eidolons are our salvation. If we can't decide what to do next, they come put us out of our misery!</li></ul>
<p>--
</p>
<ul><li><b>Vanille</b>: (<i>narrating</i>) Hey, Serah... So I guess a l'Cie doesn't have to mean you can't do what's right. Does it?</li></ul>
<p>--
</p>
<ul><li><b>Hope</b>: (<i>regarding Gran Pulse</i>) If nothing, we know Cocoon is safe for the time being. I'd say it's worth going to take a look.</li>
<li><b>Lightning</b>: Maybe. But what about your dad?</li>
<li><b>Hope</b>: I made him a promise.I promised him to keep going, and do what I had to. He said only I would know what that was. The world's full of lies. There's no way of knowing what's right. All we can do believe on ourselves It's easy to sit back and let people trick you. Like how the Sanctum had us all thinking that a l'Cie was some sort of monster. I'm done with their lies. Fal'Cie, this whole Focus thing. From here on out I use my own eyes. Think. And act. I might not make all the right choices. But as long as I'm the one who decided what to do, there's nothing regret.</li>
<li><b>Sazh</b>: Okay. All right. Let's do it! I'm with you, bad choices and all!</li></ul>
<p>--
</p>
<ul><li><b>Lightning</b>: Off to hell we go.</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: (<i>narrating</i>) No one ever said the future would be easy. But I think we all saw the glimmer of a dream, somewhere in the sky that night. The tiniest spark of hope that we can change our fate. Who could say? That moment has come and gone.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Vanille</b>: (<i>narrating</i>) A world wild and fragile, vibrant and untamed...Gran Pulse. It's a place where lives are ruled by the brutal struggle for survival and the callous and uncaring whim of the fal'Cie. There is no such thing as mercy...only a never ending string of trials that weed out the weak and leave only the strong. Raines knew the truth...the purpose lying in the heart of the fal'Cies' actions: 'Recalling their lost deity and returning the world to its former glory.' People were never anything more than sacrifices. And Cocoon's destruction? It's just a way to wake a sleeping god. But would bringing back the Maker into this world really lead to our salvation? The Maker created fal'Cie...and they, in their desperation of being reunited with the Maker, created l'Cie. And l'Cie? I wonder what we'll end up creating. Our future looked bleak. But as long as we could keep our spirits up...we'd find a way to change our fate--somehow.</li></ul>
<p>--
</p>
<ul><li><b>Sazh</b>: How long has it been since left Cocoon? Hm? Not a single soul for miles around, not a single clue about this whole l'Cie mess! What I'm saying is, we did well just getting this far.</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: But...we could go a little further.</li>
<li><i>Sazh'</i>: Meaning?</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: That's still one place...</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>: Vanille! Are you sure?</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: I'm sure.</li>
<li><b>Lightning</b>:You know, if we don't find anything this time, we won't get another chance.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>[Hope comes to]</dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Hope</b> Oerba--the place it all began. The place where the Pulse fal'Cie lay dreaming. Vanille and Fang's home. Just maybe... it will be the place where we find the answers we're looking for.</li></ul>

</p>
<ul><li><b>Lightning</b>: We understand. You're not gonna go through this ordeal alone, you know.</li>
<li><b>Hope</b>[starts crying]: But that what scares me! I don't...I don't want see you get hurt because of me. It would be better for everyone if I just stayed behind.</li></ul>
<dl><dd>[Alexander emerges, knocking the others back as Lightning and Fang run in front of Hope.]</dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Fang</b>:  Mention ordeals, and look what comes along!</li>
<li><b>Lightning</b>: This is not an ordeal, this a gift! Hope, this the kind of power you've got inside. And it's telling you not to give up. Trust me.</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>: Oh, I get. It's here to show you the way. Show what you've got what it takes to get back on your feet and do this thing!</li>
<li><b>Hope</b>: You mean, that came from me?</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Sazh</b>: That's some beast you tamed, I'll tell you that.</li>
<li><b>Hope</b>: Yeah. I always thought the Eidolons appeared to set us free through death. But now... I think maybe they're here to snap us out of our slumps</li>
<li><b>Snow</b>: Oh. Like the one you were just in?</li>
<li><b>Hope</b>: I'll ask for help earlier next time</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>:  I told you. On Gran Pulse, we're all family. You can moan all you like, but you're stuck with us.</li>
<li><b>Sazh</b>: You're never alone in hell.</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>: Listen, funnyman, don't call this place hell, all right?</li>
<li><b>Lightning</b>: So, we're decided then?</li></ul>
<dl><dd>[Every agrees.]</dd></dl>
<ul><li><b>Vanille</b>: (<i>narrating</i>) Maybe nothing would change. And maybe we'd dead end. But, we were at least going to see  where the road would take us. The search for a home buried in the past. And the faintest glimmer of hope. Our final journey had just begun.</li></ul>
<p>--
</p>
<ul><li><b>Vanille</b>: Something on you mind?</li>
<li><b>Hope</b>:  Huh? Oh, I, uh--I was just thinking.</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: About what? Something complicated?</li>
<li><b>Hope</b>: I was just taking it all in. The sky here, the trees, the sunlight, the smells..When I was on Cocoon, I never dreamed a place like this could even exist. But now? Here I am, on Pulse. If I hadn't gone to those fireworks, if I hadn't been sitting in that same train car during the Purge...If anything had been different, I'd never have had a chance to see this.</li>

</p>
<ul><li><b>Fang</b>: It's my fault Gran Pulse ended up like this, isn't it? I remember everything. I became Ragnarok. I scarred Cocoon. And I left Gran Pulse in this mess, It was me.</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: What are you talking about?</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>: It all came to me. Everything that happened with our Focus. All of it.</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: You're lying.</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>: No, it's the truth. It's all my fault.</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: Don't say that!</li></ul>
<p>--

<ul><li><b>Fang</b>:  I knew something was off. You've been shying away from our Focus even since we woke up on Cocoon.</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: I..</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>:  I couldn't figure it out, But then it all made sense, after hearing that story from Raines, You already knew. You knew Ragnarok was the name of destruction.</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: It wasn't fair. You had to do all the horrible stuff and I didn't have to so anything--</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>:  That is no reason to lie to me! You think that's what I want? You of all people!</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Vanille</b>: (<i>reading a prophecy</i>) 'Cocoon, where the slaves of Lindzei dwell, is the enemy of all life fostered by Pulse's sacred hand,. So our fal'Cie determined Pulse's will, chose l'Cie and gave them a Focus: Become Ragnarok, and bring about the end of Cocoon. And so the beast arose, defeated Lindzei's hateful fal'Cie, and prepared to tear Cocoon apart. But her Providence betray our l'Cie, draining Ragnarok of strength. Their Focus only half complete, the l'Cie were taken to the enemy's land...by Barthandelus, curse his name. And the Goddess said: l'Cie who rest upon Cocoon will reawaken, however long they may wait. And Ragnarok will rise again, to tear the land from it's seat in the sky. Her word...is absolute.'</li>
<li><b>Sazh</b>: Guess the jig is up.</li></ul>

</p>
<ul><li><b>Hope</b>: Lightning, you told me on Cocoon. It's not a question of can or can't. We just do it. That's our only choice this time, Maybe it won't do much. Maybe only one person will listen to us. But even then, isn't trying better than doing nothing?</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: Because ripples can make waves!</li>
<li><b>Sazh</b>: Okay, kids have gone crazy.</li>
<li><b>Fang</b>:  Revolutionaries always get called crazy.</li>
<li><b>Vanille</b>: When I was on Cocoon, I wished on those fireworks. I wished to not let anything happen to Cocoon this time. But I shouldn't have wished for that. Wishes aren't enough. Prayers either. This time I'm making a promise: I will keep Cocoon safe. I promise, no matter what.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Vanille</b>: (<i>narrating</i>) Even if we were chasing shadows, our minds were made up. We'd realized along was that choice was the only thing we had left. Maybe we'd fall short. Maybe we'd never even come close. But, someone, someday, would know we tried.</li></ul>

Sure, you think the end of the world is salvation. All you care about is death's release. So take it, and leave the rest of us alone. We don't think like that.
