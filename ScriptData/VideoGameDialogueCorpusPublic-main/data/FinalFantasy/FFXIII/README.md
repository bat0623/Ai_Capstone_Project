# Final Fantasy XIII

## Source

This source is only a sample of dialogue; various main and optional conversations are omitted.

## Gender coding

Lightning is a female character. She is not the only main playable character (this is an ensemble game) - others added.

'Commander' is known as 'PSICOM Soldier' in the English translation subtitles (for reference). It's a male avatar and male voice, so I've coded accordingly.

'Titan' is listed as male in the fan wiki, and as a player reads as male to me (voice).

'Orphan' is listed as genderless in the fan wiki; I have added Orphan to 'neutral' but perhaps that should be a different category?

The 'PSICOM Marauder' is a boss with a male voice and male avatar (the fan wiki page 'PSICOM' - https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/PSICOM - shows the different avatars for different PSICOM enemies. Some (e.g. the Huntress) are coded as very specifically female (visual gender signifiers), while the rest by contrast appear to be male). "PSICOM soldier" can be clearly heard in the Race Track cutscene - I've coded them as male. The other ("PSICOM Soldier") isn't as easy to find, so I've added them to "neutral".

As is tropey, the Reporter is female.

Staff 1 is female, and staff 2 and 3 are male (based on their avatars and voices).
