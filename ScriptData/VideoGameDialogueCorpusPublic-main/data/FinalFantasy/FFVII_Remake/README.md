# Final Fantasy VII Remake

## Source

The [source page](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII_Remake_script) suggests that this is "the full verbal transcript" of all "cutscene dialogue and mandatory gameplay dialogue".

This is from the version "Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade", which includes the episode "INTERmission", featuring Yuffie as the main character.

## Gender coding

"3-C Soldier" coded as male based on avatar and pronouns in the wiki. 
"Administrative Assistant" appears here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlAIdpH-US4 at 0:32, coded female. 
"Air Traffic Controller" can be heard faintly here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHFfnIzfHCo at 4:37. Coded male. 
Some "Announcement" lines can be heard here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATrZiRY-NhQ (train), as is tropey, it's a female voice. Others can be heard here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Et3BoXVDy4U (2:57), here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjtxoZDSBQY (26:17) and here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0sb6FJCuyY (1:58) and in all cases it's a female voice, so coded accordingly. Added aliases for misspellings. 
"Avalanche Helicopter" can be heard here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcGGYsve_4g&t=0s (10:08). Coded male. "Shinra Helicopter" can be heard here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoMxaBeNmes&t=0s (0:47). Coded male. "Avalanche Member" at 1:33 (male), "Senior Officer" at 12:55 (male), "New Recruit" at 12:57 (male). 

The generic "Security Officer" avatar/voice is male, and is described in the wiki as a male. The three "bandit" avatars all appear male, so I have coded accordingly. 

"Boy" and "Girl" denote different characters throughout, but genders correspond as the names indicate. 

"Radio" can be heard https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5hu0KuMZyM from 17:00 onwards.  "Soldier" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00LhrP5XQhU 5:58. "Passenger"'s dialogue appears in the subtitles here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evYKGRtN6O0&t=1448s at 9:38, but I can't see the avatar nor hear the voice, so coded as neutral.  

I couldn't find the neighbourhood watch member associated with "We've got this area covered, don't worry" so have coded as neutral ("Neighborhood Watch Member (Not Found)"; the others I have given aliases and gender coded. I can't guarantee that some of them aren't duplicates (e.g. two aliases might actually be the same NPC - given the shared avatars and off-screen lines it's too onerous to tell). I've added aliases likewise for the various "undercity resident" NPCs (and the variations); 

"Barker" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmhGbjXHHik 0:45 (male). "Vending Machine" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAfpEbtrx7Q 6:10 (male). 

Most ambient dialogue isn't recorded in our script. However there are some exceptions, sometimes titled "Npc" in the original. I've added aliases. The characters can be seen/heard as follows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoMxaBeNmes&t=0s 11:07; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz1zxFpbov4 11:16; https://youtu.be/evYKGRtN6O0 (from about 9:55); https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YxEy0kfQ1Y&t=510s 6:02; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YxEy0kfQ1Y&t=510s 7:30. 

"Announcer" denotes three different people, divided into "Announcer (train)" (female, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WWkgQsYcls 1:58); "Announcer (Corneo Cup)" (female, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrMjuDK_co 3:20); "Announcer (Anchor)" (male, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YxEy0kfQ1Y&t=510s 7:07). 

"Arsenal" can be heard https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MBDe9KgiZM (3:13) - coded female (another announcer type voice). 

"Beastmaster" appears in the Corneo Cup sequence: coded male. "Clothing Store Owner" is referred to as an "old dude" several times in the script (male). "Elevator" appears https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtqssK9HLQs&t=0s at 5:42 (female). 

I've removed the "Marle: Marlene" alias, as Marle is a separate character, as seen here: https://youtu.be/EoMxaBeNmes (13:28). Corrected "Barrett"/"Barret" spelling in the coding and the aliases. 

"Researcher (1)" and "Researcher (2)" appear here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtqssK9HLQs&t=0s from 9:09 (both coded male). "Subordinate" at 9:39 (male) (a different subordinate appears at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YxEy0kfQ1Y 2:42 but is also male), "Guide" at 14:35 (male). "Collaborator" appears here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7vofrVlsvw&t=0s (11:29 - self-described "man of my word", male). 

"Receptionist" denotes two different characters, which I've given aliases ("Honeybee Receptionist" can be seen here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_jYnCzOuBE (3:33 - male); "Hologram Receptionist" here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtqssK9HLQs&t=0s (11:00 - female). 

I've split up the Shinra Employee dialogue as it belongs to different NPCs. "Shinra Employee (lift)": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtqssK9HLQs 7:37 (male). "Shinra Employee (glasses)" https://youtu.be/58eOvnicw9g 3:24; "Shinra Employee (table)" 3:07; "Shinra Employee (phone)" 3:17; "Shinra Employee (woman)" 13:54; "Shinra Employee (business)" 17:32; "Shinra Employee (sim)" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4fFt9lzU2c 3:06; "Shinra Employee (tips)" 3:38. 
Likewise for the numbered Shinra Employees - I've relabelled them and they can be found as follows: "Shinra Employee (vent 1)" and "Shinra Employee (vent 2)" https://youtu.be/58eOvnicw9g 17:07 (1 is male, 2 is female). "Shinra Employee (train 1)" and "Shinra Employee (train 2)" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKWNe7Mfg4k 0:00 (this one got more complicated as the original version didn't always correctly distinguish between Shinra Middle Manager and the other male employee, but as it currently stands (1) is female and (2) male). 

"Reporter" https://youtu.be/tlLItWlEClE 11:23 (female); "Console" 17:49 (female). The various Corneo Lackeys look to have male avatars. "Customer" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb9pdLphn-0 1:02 (male). "DJ" https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ujn8PAVycHJ16K29b9vrUG7DWKU=/1400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19898228/FF7_Remake_Hip_Hop_de_Chocobo_song_music_disc.jpg (male). "Doctor" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aey8_OALvk0 0:30 (male). The avatar for "Gatekeeper" appears male, likewise for "Junk Dealer". "Materia Vendor" can be seen here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrC1X9GsPlM (0:06, male). Pharmacist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePjf2cOGS0I (0:08, male), Patient 1:10 (male). "Restaurant Owner" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cQkzBoPgPY (1:33, male). "Host" https://youtu.be/58eOvnicw9g (3:49, male), Server (4:27, female). 

"Elite Grenadier" uses a fairly standard male enemy avatar and male pronouns in the wiki (male), likewise for the "Elite Security Officer", "Elite Shock Trooper", "Grenadier", "Helitrooper" and "Flametrooper". There are four "Hoodlum" avatars, but they all appear to be male (wiki). The "Item Store" owner is shown on the wiki (https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Sector_7_Slums_(VII_Remake_field)) and appears male; the wiki uses male pronouns on his quest page ("Rat Problem"). 

There is only one instance of "honeygirls" and they only utter one line, so I've left this as previously coded (female) as it's difficult to track down the one line and determine how many of the honeygirls say it. "Second Party Member" I suspect can refer to either Tifa or Barret (depending on who you have as your second party member), so I've coded as neutral. "Robot" can be overheard here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58eOvnicw9g (1:08) - it's a pretty stereotypical female robotic voice, so I've coded accordingly (although an argument could be made for neutral). 

Neighborhood Watch Member ("We can get through this!") is female https://youtu.be/LRB2xckCpDg?t=430
