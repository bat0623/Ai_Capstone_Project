</p><p>(Upon approaching Jessie.)<br />

</p><p>(Upon talking to Jessie.)<br />
<b>Jessie</b>: I can't stop thinking about it. The bomb I made shouldn't have produced an explosion that big. It doesn't make any sense...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: The explosion triggered a reaction with the mako. You said so yourself.
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: That was my first guess—but shouldn't a reactor have fail—safes to prevent that kinda thing? You mentioned "invisible enemies" back there, right?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Right.
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: Hmm... No. I'm just looking for excuses for something that was clearly my own fault. Gotta own up to it if I'm gonna learn from this and move on. Thanks, Cloud. You're a good listener.

</p><p><b>Shinra Employee (2)</b>: Don't antagonize him!

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: How many times do I have to tell you people. I'm not—
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: Shh. There's such a thing as playing too hard to get.
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: So, here we've got a wireframe model of the great city of Midgar. Complete with massive steel plates suspended three hundred meters above ground level... Atop which stands a shining beacon of civilization. The whole system is sustained by the mako reactors, which feed the insatiable appetites of the public.
</p><p><b>Announcement</b>: The train will be passing through an ID checkpoint shortly.
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: This here is the train's route. As you can see, it'll take us around this main pillar. Look—we're about halfway through it now. They've set up a checkpoint here to scan the IDs of all passengers heading in and out. Date of birth, residential status, criminal history... All that and more is automatically cross-referenced in their databases. Public Security wouldn't have it any other way. Heads up.
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: Don't worry. Our IDs are impeccable.
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: What'd I tell you? Have a little faith.
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: Won't be long till we reach the bottom. Relax.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Take a good look. It's because of that great big pizza in the sky that people down there gotta struggle to survive. Shinra sucks up mako while the soil turns to dust, the air fills with smog, and the flowers die.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Then leave and don't look back. That's what's always worked for me.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Hmph! Well, that's all well and good if you're only out for yourself. But the folks down there don't have the luxury of choice, you know?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Like this train, I suppose... There's only one way it can go...

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: There is one thing. My money. You guys owe me two thousand, remember?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I do, and we'd love to settle up, especially since this was your first job for us, but...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: That's it?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Sorry. We spent the rest preparing for the mission. That really is it. But not for long! I'm collecting money for filters tomorrow, so I can pay you after.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: (sighs) And you're sure about that?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Of course...as long as you help, that is. Wait... Then I'd have to pay you for that too. Never mind.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: No, two thousand's enough. That's what we agreed on, so that'll be the price. With what you gave me, that leaves fifteen hundred.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: You're the best! I'll see you bright and early at the bar, then. Thanks again for everything. Sleep tight!

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I've been around.
</p><p><b>Marle</b>: I'll bet. No matter. All kinds come through with all kinds of reasons. If you ever need an ear to bend, I'll lend you mine. Can be about anything—even Tifa.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What's she to you?
</p><p><b>Marle</b>: The granddaughter I never had. And if you hurt her, I'll take it out of your hide. You hear me?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Loud and clear.
</p><p><b>Marle</b>: Good! Now you'd best get a move on to Seventh Heaven! She's got a head start on you and then some.

<ul><li>You know Tifa's probably wondering why you haven't joined her yet.</li>
<li>Come on, quit lollygagging and go to Seventh Heaven already!</li>

<p>(Upon entering Seventh Heaven.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Morning!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Hey.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Just so you know, Marlene's still asleep.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Let's get down to business, shall we? These water filters won't replace themselves. Although, the next batch probably <i>could</i>, if Jessie put her mind to it. Most every home in the area has one. Folks love 'em 'cause they practically eliminate the rotten-egg smell. Honestly, they make us more money than this place. And it's easy money too. We bring new filters, collect the old ones, and get paid.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: What?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Gimme a break. I'm not a salesman. I'm a SOLDIER.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Which is why no one will refuse to pay. What do you say? Please?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Let's get this over with.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Great. And while we're at it, I'll give you the grand tour.
</p><p>(Upon walking outside Seventh Heaven.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Go ahead and keep whatever we collect. Seeing as you didn't bring any luggage, I'm guessing there's stuff you need to buy.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Thanks.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: And don't worry. We'll pay you the difference after. Barret's out making his rounds too.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: As long as I get it all today.
</p><p>(Upon entering the Item Store.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Hey, there. Here to change out your water filter.
</p><p><b>Item Store Owner</b>: Tifa baby, how you doing? Been waiting for you to—Wait. Who's he?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud's in charge of collections. He'll take your money.
</p><p><b>Item Store Owner</b>: Sounds like a pretty sweet gig! If you ever need someone to fill in, I'm your man.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: In your dreams, maybe.
</p><p><b>Item Store Owner</b>: Huh?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud! Uh...since we're here, maybe we should do a little shopping?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Suppose I could take a look.
</p><p>(After closing the shop menu.)<br />
<b>Item Store Owner</b>: Thanks! If you're ever in the market for anything else, drop on by. Especially if Tifa's with you.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: We'll see you around, okay? And let us know when your filter next needs changing!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the item store owner.)<br />

<ul><li>Hey—no window-shopping, all right?</li>
<li>What's a girl like Tifa doing running around with a guy like...</li>
<li>What you see is what we got.</li>
<li>Take a look around if you want.</li></ul>
<p>(Upon leaving the store.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: He's a regular. Stock up here and he might throw in a freebie or two.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: For <i>you</i> maybe...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Well... You could try being a little nicer.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: To get free shit? Not my style.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: (chuckles) Our next stop is Stargazer Heights. Landlady's a client.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Just met her.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Then you know what to expect. Remember: she's a good friend of Avalanche, so be nice. Please.
</p><p>(Upon approaching Marle.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Hey, Marle! Got some filters for you.
</p><p><b>Marle</b>: Tifa! My dear, dear girl! ...Oh. What's he doing here?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Working.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Be nice! Cloud's helping me with collections.
</p><p><b>Marle</b>: You'd better take care of her!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I'm pretty good at taking care of myself, you know.
</p><p><b>Marle</b>: That I do. Still, better him than you. No charm, no wit. Big sword...but no skills.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I've got skills.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Be nice!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'm doing my best...
</p><p><b>Marle</b>: You're looking awfully glum. Are you getting enough sleep? A good long rest'll cure anything, I tell you.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: A tried-and-true lesson for life on the ground floor, am I right?
</p><p><b>Marle</b>: That you are. Now—your money.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Thanks, Marle. You take care of yourself.
</p><p><b>Marle</b>: Don't do anything I wouldn't do!

<ul><li>You'd better not cause Tifa any heartache!</li>
<li>You'd have more color in your cheeks if you went to bed earlier!</li>
<li>Don't you still have work to do? Well, go on, then—get back to it!</li></ul>
<p>(Upon leaving towards the Beginner's Hall.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Marle's great. She helped get me set up back in the day.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: You...been here a while now?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Five years, give or take... But never mind that! We've gotta get you your money! Last stop is the weapon store.
</p><p>(Upon approaching the Weapons Vendor.)<br />
<b>Weapons Vendor</b>: Hey! That last filter didn't do shit!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: We're so sorry about that. Hopefully this one will work better...
</p><p><b>Weapons Vendor</b>: Save your excuses and get out!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: All right. If you could just settle your bill, we'll be on our way.
</p><p><b>Weapons Vendor</b>: The hell? You charging me for your busted-ass goods?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: My associate handles payment disputes...
</p><p><b>Weapons Vendor</b>: Think you can mosey up in here and have it your way?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Pretty please.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Thank you very much!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Seeing as we're done with our rounds, and you've got a small fortune now, why not take a gander at the weapons?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Well...when will Barret be back with the rest?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Before we open up tonight. It'll be a while yet, so...what do you wanna do?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Don't really know...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: In that case, I've got a suggestion. Wanna hear it? If you're serious about becoming a merc, then you're going to need to start making connections. "It's not what you know, but who you know," y'know?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Hmph. Another lesson for life on the ground floor?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Yep. Connections get you jobs, jobs build your rep, and more rep gets you better connections...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: How do I start?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Hmm...why not help out the neighborhood watch? They're mostly volunteers, but you'll get to know people.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Yeah, okay.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Didn't see anybody at the office, so let's head up top.

<b>Tifa</b>: Huh, didn't know you were holding down the fort.
</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: Oh, hey, Cloud. Looking to join the neighborhood watch?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: That depends. What does this neighborhood watch do?
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Umm...lots of stuff, really. But our top priority is taking care of any beasts that wander into town. That, and teaching the locals how to defend themselves.
</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: Like they say: "The only one who'll look out for you is you."
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud's a great fighter, but only we know that. If no one knows him, no one'll hire him. Thought if he joined the watch, he could get his name out there.
</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: That would work for everybody!
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Truth be told, we could really use your help. We can't pay you in girl, but we'll work something out. For example... Aha, what about your sword? I could mod it for you.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: No thanks. It's fine just the way it is.
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: You some kind of a purist? I know <i>I'd</i> never pass up a chance to improve my gear. C'mon...at least let me show you how it's done.
</p><p>(After closing or skipping the weapon upgrade tutorial.)<br />
<b>Biggs</b>: All set? Needless to say, you'll have to try it out to appreciate the difference.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Thanks.
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: We'll do you one better—spread the word to everyone who'll listen about the new merc in town.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Between him and Wedge, there isn't anyone they don't know.
</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: I'll march through the streets singing your praises—even on an empty stomach!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: So...where are these monsters?
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Scrap Boulevard. Good hunting.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Hey, Cloud. I'll come with.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: No, I've got this.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: But...you don't know the way, do you?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Lead on.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: (chuckles) Sure thing. I know these streets better than anyone.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Biggs.)<br />
</p>
<dl><dt>Biggs</dt></dl>
<ul><li>Just so you know, the watch relies on residents' donations for funding.</li>
<li>This isn't just a cover—we really do wanna keep the neighborhood safe. We grew up here, after all.</li>
<li>Lemme have a look at your sword when you get back, huh?</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to Wedge.)<br />
</p>
<dl><dt>Wedge</dt></dl>
<ul><li>Won't be anyone who doesn't know about the new merc when we're through!</li>
<li>Working for the neighborhood watch is the best kind of cover.</li>
<li>You can go all over town, meet all kinds of people, and no one bats an eye.</li></ul>
<p>(Upon leaving the room towards Scrap Boulevard.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Scrap Boulevard is out west. Past the barricades supposed to keep the monsters out. Anyway, we should prepare, just in case.
</p><p>(Upon entering Scrap Boulevard.)<br />
<b>On-screen</b>: Scrap Boulevard
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Here's Scrap Boulevard.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I can see why monsters'd feel right at home.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Hm. And the more we pile up, the more they show up.
</p><p>(Upon reaching a group of monsters.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: And there's our first challenger! Show me what you got, Cloud!
</p><p>(Upon defeating the first group.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Wow... So that's what a SOLDIER looks line in action.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: This was just a warm-up.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: (chuckles) I'll bet. Let's keep at it!
</p><p>(Upon defeating a third group of monsters.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: You're good at this! Charging in like it was nothing...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: You too. It's a little surprising.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Well, I've been here five years now. "If you don't look out for yourself, no one else will." By the way—that one's gonna be on the test.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: This a lesson?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Gotta learn if you're gonna stick around. Okay, let's wrap this up...
</p><p>(Upon defeating the final group.)<br />
<b>Tifa</b>: Alright. I think that might be the last of them.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: They won't stay gone for long...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Of course not. Even so, folks'll be grateful for the peace and quiet in the meantime. A win's a win, you know?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: True.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Trust me—it'll do wonders for your rep. Right, let's go check in with Biggs and Wedge.
</p><p>(Upon walking past Katie before talking to her.)<br />

<b>Katie</b>: It's you! You're the merc everybody's talking about, am I right?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Yeah.
</p><p><b>Katie</b>: I <i>knew</i> it! So, the board here tracks how many monsters folks've taken down, right? A bigger number means a safer town—and who wouldn't want that? Just between you and me, though—they're pretty much all <i>your</i> kills. Cool, huh? Anyway, keep up the good work! We'll try to make it worth your while.
</p><p>(Upon walking past Katie after talking to her while numbers are lower.)<br />
<b>Katie</b>: C'mon you guys! Let's get these numbers up!
</p><p>(Upon walking past Katie while numbers are higher.)<br />
</p>
<dl><dt>Katie</dt></dl>
<ul><li>Can you believe how much safer our town has become!?</li>
<li>I sure do love the smell of safety, don't you!?</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to Katie after defeating 50+ monsters.)<br />
<b>Katie</b>: Whoa, check it out! I don't think the number's ever gone that high before! At this rate, we won't have to worry about monsters ever again! What a thing to be able to say...
</p><p><b>Katie</b>: Thank you so, so much! We'll never forget how many bloodthirsty beasts you kept off our streets! Ahhh, smell that fresh air! That's the smell of a safe and happy town—one you can be proud to call home!
</p><p>(Upon talking to Katie after collecting the final reward.)<br />
<b>Katie</b>: Hey there, how's it going? I don't think anyone's ever gonna beat that record of yours! It's incredible!
</p><p>(Upon returning to Biggs and Wedge at the Beginner's Hall.)<br />
<b>Biggs</b>: Back already?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Got every last one too. Now the slums should be safe.
</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: You guys are machines!
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Good job. Meanwhile, we told everyone we could about you.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: So I heard. I've gotta ask though. <i>What</i> did you tell them?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: It's alright. All you gotta do is keep up the good work. It'll pay off soon enough, I promise.
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: How's the sword, by the way?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Good.
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Glad to hear it. Seems like the perfect fit for you.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Yeah. We've been through a lot—
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: You okay?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'm fine.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Been meaning to ask... After you left the village...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: It's a long story.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I've got time! Why don't you tell me all about it while we try to rustle up some more work for you?
</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: That sounds great! I'll come too!
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Oh, no you won't. Run along now, you two. Go on.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Sorry. Maybe next time.
</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: No fair!

</p><p><b>Weapons Vendor</b>: Sorry 'bout before. I get antsy when business is slow. Man in your line of work needs weapons, no? Why not try that one on for size? Yours on the house. Badass like you rocking my weapons is good advertising. Think about it.

</p><p><b>Wymer</b>: Hah, you don't say! Well, we're always on the lookout for experienced fighters to help us deal with the bigger critters.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'll take on anything. For the right price, that is.
</p><p><b>Wymer</b>: Experienced <i>and</i> cocky, huh? If it's a challenge you want, I might have a few good ones. Your clients can fill you in on the details. Prove yourself with these jobs, and I'll see if I can't find you some more.

</p><p><b>Chadley</b>: My name is Chadley. I'm an intern for Shinra's Research and Development Division. I hope you'll be interested in helping me with my research. Please accept this as a down payment.
</p><p><b>Chadley</b>: I would like you to set that Assess materia in your equipment and use it to gather intelligence in battle. This data will help me to develop new types of materia.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'm not interested in working for Shinra.
</p><p><b>Chadley</b>: You should know that I work actively to undermine Shinra's efforts.

<b>Item Store Owner</b>: Hey there, Tifa, welcome back! And you. The new merc in town looking for work, right?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Yeah.
</p><p><b>Item Store Owner</b>: In that case, maybe you could do something about the doomrats? Them and their wererat buddies have been tearing up town, looking for food and whatnot. Got into the store and made one hell of a mess, let me tell you.
</p><p><b>Item Store Owner</b>: Oh, you think that's funny, do you? Don't lie. I saw you crack a smile. Well, do the job and you can laugh it up for all I care. Anyway...they're probably nesting in the outskirts. Now I've heard a wererat in pain'll call its friends for help. And the whole rat pack'll come running, just like that.

<b>Item Store Owner</b>: Well? Rats too much to handle? I'm just messing with you—heard you took out some wererats, which is nice and all, but the job was to wipe out the doomrats. No biggie—get back out there and finish the job and we're good.

</p><p><b>Item Store Owner</b>: I'll make it worth your while, of course. Give you some incentive. Talk you up to Wymer and my customers and anybody else who'll listen. You'll be swimming in work before you know it!

</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Get off me, assholes! I didn't do shit!
</p><p><b>Security Officer</b>: Shut it, punk!
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Or what!? Screw you!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: What's going on?
</p><p><b>Undercity Resident (1)</b>: "Somebody" went and stole some blasting agent from a Shinra warehouse. So Public Security started asking questions, and you know how Johnny gets...
</p><p><b>Undercity Resident (2)</b>: It's because of the reactor bombing, I bet. I could be wrong... But something tells me they're not gonna settle for just roughing him up this time.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: We've gotta save him, Cloud!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Is he Avalanche?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: No. He doesn't really know what we do...but he has his suspicions. And... He's a talker.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Actually, you know what...maybe I should go alone.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'm coming.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Uh...are you sure?

</p><p>(While following Johnny further in.)<br />
<b>Security Officer</b>: Shut your mouth and keep walking! Or else!
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Come on, guys! Is this any way to treat a model citizen of Midgar?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Come on. Let's get a closer look.
</p><p>(Upon hiding behind the storage container further in.)<br />
<b>Security Officer</b>: Model citizens don't steal blasting agent! So why don't you tell me why your ID popped when we were going over the warehouse logs!?
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Huh? You've got it all wrong! I've never gone anywhere near a Shinra warehouse! Unless it was Jessie... She jacked my ID!
</p><p><b>Security Officer</b>: Your ID was never logged, dumbass. It would've never gotten you inside a Shinra installation in the first place! But don't you worry—we'll take all the time we need to help you get your story straight.
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: What!? That's bullshit! Cheap bullshit! Entrapment! Yeah, yeah! I know my rights!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I swear, all he had to do was keep his mouth shut.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Yep.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Anyway, you distract the officers, and I'll...figure something out.
</p><p>(Upon opening the gate and approaching Johnny.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: Let him go.
</p><p><b>Security Officer</b>: Who're you? The cavalry?
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Is that—is that who I think it is!? Aw, hell yeah! You guys really came to save me! Ava—
</p><p><b>Security Officer</b>: Hey! The hell you think you're doing!?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Here we go...
</p><p>(After defeating the enemies.)<br />

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: He's a talker.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: No!
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Huh!? You're not gonna... Hold up! Wait! Don't—don't do it, man!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: You wanna live, then get the hell out of town.
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Y-y-you got it, boss! You ain't never gonna see my face again, I swear!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Are you sure about this? It's a big risk.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I know, but...it's fine.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: And them?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: No more... Cloud... You're scaring me.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: We need to go before they wake up.

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Same as you, I guess.

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Tifa...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Yeah, I'm feeling it a bit too. Hey... Do you think you'll stick around a little longer?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Maybe. Work for a minute, build up some savings...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I see. In that case, wanna head back out and look for more gigs?

They don't know our faces, so we're in the clear for now, but we'll wanna capitalize on this momentum. Speaking of which, you coming on the next one?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: For the right price.
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: Oh, you can bet I'll be pushing hard for a raise!
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: Tifa'll be joining us too, but I dunno... Even a blind man can see her heart's not in it. She was never on board with the bombings, so if it comes down to do or die... If I've got to put my life in someone else's hands... Then...I'd rather that someone was a professional. Like you.

</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Eh... You've got a point.

</p><p>(After defeating the second group.)<br />
<b>Jessie</b>: "Had the cold-eyed mercenary's heart suddenly begun to melt?"
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Nope.
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: I won't forget that. (laughs) Wait, is it just me or did we slow down?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Just you.

</p><p><b>Mobile Unit Officer (2)</b>: Probably. All the more reason to finish this quick. Don't need that kind of trouble.
</p><p>(After defeating the sixth group.)<br />

</p><p><b>Roche</b>: "Too quick for the eye, you cross him, you die!" Now... Mind if I cut in? Woo! Splendid! I've been looking for a new dance partner!
</p><p><b>Roche</b>: Private party, huh? That's fine. I'll settle for a race then. Just one.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: You talking to me?
</p><p><b>Roche</b>: I most certainly am.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Then no!
</p><p><b>Roche</b>: Ah, so terribly sorry! Your words fail to reach my ears, sluggish and slow as they are!
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: What's this guy's deal!?
</p><p><b>Roche</b>: The lady's curiosity has been piqued! My name is Roche, but you may address me by the more accurate appellation: Speed Demon!
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: Heard <i>that</i>, huh!?
</p><p><b>Roche</b>: My ears are attuned to the feminine voice!
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: This guy is the worst.
</p><p><b>Roche</b>: Yes. Yes! This is the contest I've been waiting for!
</p><p>(When Roche is at half HP.)<br />
<b>Roche</b>: Fascinating...
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: What is he up to now?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Same shit. Being a dumbass.
</p><p><b>Roche</b>: Not bad. You have promise, and an abiding affection for your mount. But! One cannot simply ride one's bike! Nay! One must unlock its true potential—become one with the machine! Like this!
</p><p>(After defeating Roche.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: Had enough?
</p><p><b>Roche</b>: Don't be absurd. As if I could ever grow tired of your company!
</p><p><b>Roche</b>: Naughty, naughty! Until one of our flames is forever extinguished, our dance will never end! (laughs) Burn for me!
</p><p><b>Roche</b>: Come on! Let's push it past the redline!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Jessie, take over.
</p><p><b>Roche</b>: Well, well, well! I do believe this round is yours. (chuckles) Maybe next time we can keep it just between the two of us.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Maybe.
</p><p><b>Roche</b>: (laughs) Until we meet again, my friend!
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: We did it!

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: This it?
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: Now comes the hard part. I'm gonna use this to sneak into the 7-6 Annex.
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: All right, let's get to it.
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: Sorry, but you're staying outside. Only I know what to steal from where, so it's gotta be me who goes in.
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: So...we came all this way just to eat pizza!?
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: (chuckles) You think I'd let you off that easy? You're gonna earn every slice helping Cloud. Just do the thing where you draw everyone's attention away, like you did at my parents'. What's the word again? Maybe I'm more nervous than I thought.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Diversion.
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: Yeah, that! Nice one, military man.
</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: So what, does this mean we're gonna ask some Shinra folks out to dinner?
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: You know damn well what she means. While you're inside, we make sure the guards are focused on the outside. Yeah?
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: Exactly. Couldn't've put it any better. When you see a flare go up, that's your cue. Rush the front gates and make for the warehouse plaza. The more hell you raise, the more time you buy me.
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: You're gonna run this guy into the ground, aren'tcha?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: How much time do you think you'll need?
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: Not too much. I'll be in and out. I'll send up another flare when I'm done. We rendezvous in the vacant lot up ahead.
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Hold on. How are we supposed to get back to the slums? Wait for the first train?
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: No, I wanna be back before that. Don't worry, I have something worked out. Now, let's get this done.

<p><b>Biggs</b>: Jessie's dad was in there, right?

</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Mako poisoning. Happened while Jessie was doing a show at the Gold Saucer— Ah, but what do you care?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: No, I wanna hear it.
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Jessie always wanted to be an actress. Worked her ass off for years until finally she caught a break. Top billing. Parents were thrilled. And then...right before opening night...
</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: Her dad had an accident.
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Collapsed from overwork...and in the worst possible place. Mako storage. Lay there half a day before someone found him. Been like that ever since. No change whatsoever. That's what got her into planetology, and led her to seek out Avalanche. How far we've come...
</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: Jessie's got a theory about it. Thinks her dad's spirit is stuck now—between his body and the heart of the planet. So if we don't shut down the reactors soon...
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: He'll get caught up in the flow and...poof.
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: What's so funny?

</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: I see...
</p><p>(Upon reaching the bridge in front of the Sector 7-6 Annex.)<br />

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Well... No promises.

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Not my problem.
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: This guy!
</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: Hey! It's the lot Jessie was talking about. We rendezvous here when we've got what we came for.

</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: Glad yours is...
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: C'mere.
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Wedge'll be fine. But you won't be if they start asking questions.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: And who are "they"?
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: First guests to the party. Another Avalanche cell. Our holier-than-thou friends from the old guard... It's always their way or the highway. Lately they've been a real pain in the ass... Till now.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: So then why are they here?
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Beats me. We've been on the outs ever since our cell got labeled too extreme... though they're the ones running around with mil-spec gear. Word is they've cut a deal with Wutai... Promised 'em all the materia in Midgar, apparently. Think there's any truth to that?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: You tell me.
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Sometimes I think we're the only ones who've realized the war is over.

</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: If we stuck around or went back, he'd only get upset.

</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Guess a SOLDIER wouldn't understand... I'll tell him you were worried about him, though. Who knows—might just make his day.
</p><p><b>Security Officer</b>: ...And many of our citizens have already been disturbed by the alarms. Squad A will set up here and search for suspects. B will establish a perimeter—roadblocks included. Contain the situation! Rumors of violence against Public Security will only serve to frighten the people.

</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: You guys are the worst...
</p><p><b>Jessie</b>: Your ass is fine. Maybe singed, but the only casualty is your underwear. This is like a bruise or a mild burn at worst!
</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: Now <i>that</i> was a gunshot.

</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: But I'm in perfect health!
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Which makes you the perfect choice to look after Jessie and Marlene.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Let's get this show on the road... to Mako Reactor 5! Once you've got your gear in order, head to the station for the meet. Got it?

<p><b>Announcement</b>: This is an announcement from the Shinra Electric Power Company. The terrorist group "Avalanche" has issued another bomb threat. In response, we have raised the threat level and entered a state of heightened alert. All lines are currently experiencing delays. We anticipate that our arrival at Sector 4 will be later than scheduled.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: The target's Mako Reactor 5. From the station, we take the backstreets. Once we're inside the facility, it's the same deal as last time.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Head for mako storage.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: And then <i>blow</i> it all to hell.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Let's do this one for Jessie and Wedge. They deserve it.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Yeah.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Sure.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: I didn't think word would spread this fast. There's barely anyone on this train. And none of them look happy to be here.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Might stand out as a group. You two stay here.
</p><p>(Upon approaching Tifa.)<br />

<b>Tifa</b>: Hey, would you mind keeping an eye on things the next car over? I'm worried there might be trouble.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Why's that?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Barret's always on edge before missions, but you know he's a good guy underneath it all. The people on this train don't.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: He'll be fine.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Maybe...but I won't be until I know for sure.

</p><p><b>Subordinate</b>: Sir. Analytics reports that the results fall within the admissible range. However, the casualty rate significantly exceeds previous proje—
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: (groans) Remind me what your job is. Is it to question the wisdom of your superiors and bemoan your personal hardships?
</p><p><b>Subordinate</b>: Sir?
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: Casualty rate? You think I care about the casualty rate? They are pawns in a greater game. If your stock runs low, then go round up more for Sector 3 or wherever else. Use your head and bring me solutions instead of problems for a change, yes?
</p><p><b>Subordinate</b>: Sir!

<li>You struggle in vain against the airbuster. Shinra's advanced weapons are unstoppable!</li>
<li>You sewer rats are truly pathetic!</li>
<li>Yes, that's it! Very good. Now you will learn what happens to all those who oppose Shinra.</li>

</p><p><b>Chadley</b>: Oh, hello. Cloud has been assisting me with my research and development.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Ooh, that sounds fun. Count me in.
</p><p><b>Chadley</b>: One moment while I run diagnostics. Huh... How very strange... You don't appear to be in my database...
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: And that's bad?

</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Don't worry. I've brought a superstrong friend along with me.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I used to be a SOLDIER. So where's the guy?
</p><p><b>Oates</b>: I dunno. He disappeared and we can't find him.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Right now, let's worry about the kids.

</p><p><b>Ms. Folia</b>: Yeah! I am pretty upset. The kids are still off doing patrols, even though it's now time for their lessons. Not a single one of them has come back yet!
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Patrols? Is that a Leaf House thing? Something they do to help out?
</p><p><b>Ms. Folia</b>: That's right. In return for the donations we receive, the kids go around town picking up litter, running errands—that kind of thing. I don't suppose you've seen any of them, have you? You see, I have some important plans this evening, and I really need to go and get ready.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Would you like us to go round them up?

</p><p><b>Boy (2)</b>: A weird, creepy monster we've seen near the hideout lately.
</p><p><b>Girl (1)</b>: He wears a crown and walks around like he owns the place. If he's not a king, he's gotta be monster royalty at least. I bet a SOLDIER could beat him up easy!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Oh, yeah. Real easy. But here's the thing...I don't work for free—or cheap.
</p><p><b>Girl (1)</b>: But we don't have any money!
</p><p><b>Girl (2)</b>: The watch wouldn't ask for money.
</p><p><b>Boy (1)</b>: But if we ask any other grown-ups for help, they'll find out about the hideout, and that'll be it!
</p><p><b>Girl (2)</b>: We really don't wanna lose the hideout. C'mon, help us! Oh—and we'll give you some cool treasure if you do!
</p><p><b>Boy (3)</b>: And if that's not enough, I'll pay the rest of your fee once I open my shop!
</p><p><b>Boy (4)</b>: Well! If you won't help, then we'll just have to kill it ourselves!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'll do it for three gil. I'm offering a special discount right now on toad king jobs. Looks like it's your lucky day.
</p><p><b>Boy (2)</b>: Awesome! Now that's my kind of bargain!

</p><p><b>Ms. Folia</b>: Okay, kids, playtime's over for now! I've prepared a special assignment for everyone. One that I expect you to finish today. Understood?
</p><p><b>Boy</b>: Yes! Yes, Ms. Folia!

</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Wow, Ms. Folia. You must know all their secrets.
</p><p><b>Ms. Folia</b>: Oh, if only. Easier said than done. They're always on the move, looking for new adventures, chasing new dreams, all while trying to make the lives of everyone around them just a little better. I try to make sure they don't stumble and fall, and when they finally do, I help them back up.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Sounds exhausting.
</p><p><b>Ms. Folia</b>: Sometimes it is. But I want the children to know that until they can stand on their own two feet that I'm here to support them, care for them, love them—that even if we're not actually related, we're still a family—a real family, in all the ways that matter. If I can do that for them, then well...then maybe I'm making this world a better place.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: I know you are.
</p><p><b>Ms. Folia</b>: My predecessor taught me everything I know. I just took up his torch and ran with it, I guess. Not that I'm anything close to what he was. Biggs is one of a kind.
</p><p><b>Ms. Folia</b>: Oh no! I've completely lost track of time!

<b>Scared Man</b>: Shinra weapons are on the rampage. Five of 'em, like floatin' eyeballs! I saw them wander off into the scrap, but if they come back into town, it'd be a disaster. We need someone who's willing and able to fight...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'll handle it.

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Maybe.
</p><p><b>Scared Man</b>: Almost feel sorry for 'em, getting all lost and confused like that.
</p><p><b>Scared Man</b>: Ah, what am I sayin'? Man or machine... Shinra bitches get what they deserve.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Now hold on—
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Anyway, I think it's safe to say our work here is finished! If you're ever in the market for a merc again, remember: you can count on Cloud!
</p><p><b>Scared Man</b>: Uh, sure. And sorry about putting this on you all of a sudden. I'm really glad you were willing to help out, though! Thanks again.
</p><p><b>Scared Man</b>: Actually, while you're here, I've got another favor to ask. There's this old guy who hangs out in front of the weapons shop. I think he might need your help. Would you mind talking to him?

<p>(Upon approaching Damon.)<br />
<b>Damon</b>: Ah, you wouldn't happen to be a certain merc that's become the talk of the town?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Yup.
</p><p><b>Damon</b>: I'm Damon. Little more than a humble reporter with the Daily Buzz.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Ugh, that rag? The one that's always printing awful rumors about the slums?
</p><p><b>Damon</b>: On the contrary, my dear! We strive to raise awareness of the plight of our undercity brethren. We seek a better future for everyone, rich and poor.
</p><p><b>Damon</b>: Now then, my friends. I find myself in need of your exceptional services for a trifling matter. Are you familiar with the mysterious—and notorious—bandit known as the "Angel of the Slums"? She delivers written declarations to her victims—usually Shinra associates—before divesting them of their valuables.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Everyone knows her. Everything she steals, she gives to the poor and needy.
</p><p><b>Damon</b>: Yes. She's got a knack for public relations. Very popular down here as a result. Nevertheless, she is a criminal and a threat to the public order! I've made it my mission to unmask the villain, but the locals have been uncooperative and uncommunicative, to put it mildly. And now that my identity as a reporter has been exposed, my sources have all deserted me! Which brings me to you—the merc of the hour, and the man who will serve up my scoop!
</p><p>(Upon talking to Damon again.)<br />
<b>Damon</b>: I'll welcome any and all information pertaining to the so-called Angel of the Slums.
</p><p>(Upon talking to a woman inside the community center.)<br />
<b>Undercity Resident (1)</b>: Why, hello! What is it? The Guardian Angel of the Slums? Such a mysterious figure. Always talked about, but never <i>seen</i> by anyone! The Angel gets in and out without being noticed and always leaves a calling card. Maybe a magician!? No, no, it's no magic trick—it's genuine magic! Rumor has it that the Angel is a witch.
</p><p><b>Undercity Resident (2)</b>: If we're going by rumors, then I've heard that it's actually a monster in disguise.
</p><p><b>Undercity Resident (1)</b>: Well, I could talk all day about the <i>dozens</i> of stories <i>I've</i> heard!
</p><p>(Upon talking to Mireille.)<br />
<b>Aerith</b>: Good to see you again, Mireille.
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: Good to see you too, Aerith. I'd heard you found yourself a funny new friend.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Cloud, meet Mireille. She knows everything there is to know about the slums. Mireille, meet Cloud. He's a former SOLDIER, and super strong.
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: He looks useful enough. The kids have been talking about you. The defender of the secret hideout. And now the Hero of the Leaf House is helping the Daily Buzz look for the Angel of the Slums.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I am?
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: (chuckles) I'm a lover of the whispered word. Not that it's any real secret, considering how chatty that Shinra mutt's been.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Not looking into it for the reporter. I'm doing it for myself. Call it curiosity...or whatever.
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: Or could it be you've fallen under the Angel's spell like so many others? Anyway—it so happens that I have some information for you. But I'll need a moment before I can give it to you. Why don't you wait with that reporter of yours?
</p><p>(Upon talking to Mireille again.)<br />
<b>Mireille</b>: Just wait outside with the reporter. I'll be along soon.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Damon again.)<br />
<b>Damon</b>: So! Any news?
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Have you tried talking to Mireille at all? She told us that she had some information to share.
</p><p><b>Damon</b>: Mireille as in <i>the</i> Mireille? The town gossip? I chased her for days, begging for info, but she wouldn't give up a single scrap! So how'd <i>you</i> get the old bird to talk?
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: This old bird had a change of heart, that's all.
</p><p><b>Damon</b>: Then quickly, before you have another, tell us: what do you know about the notorious Angel of the Slums? Has she struck again? Is that it!?
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: I don't know anything about that. But I do know where her hideout is.
</p><p><b>Damon</b>: Her base of operations? Now that's a scoop! Where is it!? Tell me!
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: Deep in the scrap—at Lookout Point. Hardly anyone goes out there these days. It's the perfect place for a criminal to hole up.
</p><p><b>Damon</b>: Lookout Point—got it! I'll check it out right now!
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: But before you go, I should warn you about this rumor I heard—about a terrible fiend that's claimed the Angel's hideout as its lair. Quite large, lots of teeth, always hungry. I don't know about you, but I'd not go anywhere near that thing.
</p><p><b>Damon</b>: Er, well, uh... Well! A good reporter knows never to take foolish risks. "Plan first, then act." That's every respectable journalist's motto!
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: If it's a "plan" you're looking for, I'd say you have one right here. Wouldn't you?
</p><p><b>Damon</b>: So, my good mercenary. If I might impose upon you again, it would be lovely if you investigated Lookout Point for me.

<ul><li>The forgotten Lookout Point deep within the scrap. Could it be that this place holds the secrets of the Angel? This is what we need to find out!</li>
<li>If you do happen to run afoul of any ravenous fiends, it would be lovely if you did something about it. For the truth!</li>
<li>I promise I'll pay you once the job's complete. Just make sure you come back with good news—or any news!</li></ul>

<p>(After defeating the Chromogger.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: Okay then. Guess we should look around.
</p><p>(Upon inspecting the Angel's calling card.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: "The Guardian Angel of the Slums will collect your offering on behalf of the poor."
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: This must be one of her calling cards!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I don't see anything else interesting. Let's head back and tell them what we found.

<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Yes", teleport in front of Damon.)</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "No", nothing happens.)</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to Damon after inspecting the card.)<br />
<b>Damon</b>: I can't believe it! You found one of her calling cards! This is the genuine article, I'm sure of it! Penned by the Angel herself!
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: Hmm... So this is one of her famous warnings.
</p><p><b>Damon</b>: It's an incredible find! Oh—was that all?
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: Hold on. Looks like there's something else—a message. "To the nosy Shinra reporter sniffing around... I was planning to teach you a lesson you would never forget. However, by the grace of your mercenary friend, you were spared that lesson. But next time he might not be around to save you. You would be wise to watch your step."
</p><p><b>Damon</b>: Not just a message from the Angel... A warning!
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: If the merc here hadn't bailed you out, that fiend in the scrap would've ripped you to shreds. Sorry about that, friend. Here I was just trying to help you out, but instead my kindness almost got you violently killed.
</p><p><b>Damon</b>: Now, now. No harm, no foul...right? In any case, I hope this narrowly averted tragedy won't discourage you from sharing information with me in the future.
</p><p><b>Undercity Resident (1)</b>: Hey, everybody! The Angel left another calling card! She's gonna rip off Don Corneo!
</p><p><b>Undercity Resident (2)</b>: It's about damn time!
</p><p><b>Undercity Resident (3)</b>: Don Corneo's no easy mark. I can't wait to see how this goes down!
</p><p><b>Damon</b>: Excuse me! I'm a reporter for the Daily Buzz and—
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: So much for my reward.
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: Here. Why don't you take this? Oh, and no need to thank me. Let's just say it slipped out of that reporter's pocket. (laughs) Can't call it theft if you're just claiming what you're owed—am I right? Well done, mister merc. You certainly lived up to your reputation.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Mireille after the quest is complete.)<br />
</p>
<dl><dt>Mireille</dt>

<ul><li>You know, there's a rumor that the Angel of the Slums is as radiant and beautiful as she is daring. Personally, I think that one's true.</li>

<b>Old Man</b>: Oh, I know you. You must be that mercenary. I have a problem. It's the anniversary of my wife's death, and I wanted to visit her grave. But I can't because some creatures have turned the graveyard into their nest. Could you do me a favor and go there in my stead? She shouldn't be alone today.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: It'll cost you.
</p><p><b>Old Man</b>: That's fine, that's fine. The graveyard's right by the head of the river. But I heard they put a new gate in recently to replace the old broken one. Now that those creatures have moved in, I'm sure it's locked up tight.

</p><p>(Upon talking to the Old Man again before completing the task.)<br />

</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: We paid our respects to your wife—and we took care of those creatures.
</p><p><b>Old Man</b>: Oh, that's such a relief to hear. I can't tell you how much it was weighing on my mind. I was beginning to think I might never be able to visit her grave again. With my bad back and my legs—my whole body's a mess, frankly—I...I didn't think I could make it past the creatures. But I was prepared to die trying. And then you two came along.
</p><p><b>Old Man</b>: Still, I've got to face facts. Creatures or no, I can't keep making these trips...
</p><p><b>Scared Man</b>: Don't say that.

</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Because I'm not sick of you yet.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Lead on, then.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: With pleasure. (hums)
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Cloud? Is something wrong?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: It's nothing.
</p><p>(While walking down the S6-5 Road.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: You can see the sky.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: They're still working on the new plate. I don't like this part of Midgar. Back when they were still building Midgar, there was an accident, and the plate fell. People had only just started moving in, so there weren't a lot living there at the time, but...
</p><p>(Halfway along the road.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: And that's...?
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: The underside of Sector 6. "Wall Market." A real <i>special</i> place. But...I'm sure you already knew that, right?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I didn't tell you? I enlisted pretty much right after I left home. Dunno much about this place, or any of the slums.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Well, it took a lot of people to build Midgar. And they all needed to blow off steam. So some traders built an entertainment district. Inns, shops, bars, the works. Folks started pouring in from all over. Business was booming, money was flowing... Which attracted the attention of some guys who...didn't much care for the law.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: And now there isn't any.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Right. But instead of trying to solve the problem, the government decided to just wall it in. And that's how Wall Market began. "Out of sight, out of mind," as the old saying goes. For the folks in charge, there's no better way to deal with it.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: So it's like a giant veil.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Yeah. Wanna see what's behind it?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Not really.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: That's good—'cause I know a better way to get to Sector 7. One that—tragically—doesn't go through Wall Market. And it's just through this tunnel here. At least it was, back when I was a kid.

Last but not least, there's the Honeybee Inn's Andrea Rhodea. They're an eccentric bunch, to put it mildly, and you should know they don't recommend just any girl stupid enough to come knocking.

</p><p><b>Sam</b>: Hmph.
</p><p><b>Madam M</b>: Oh! You're taking this rather well. I was looking forward to a little temper tantrum.
</p><p><b>Sam</b>: When you bet it all on a toss, sometimes you get burned by lady luck. Every coin has two sides.

</p><p><b>Sam</b>: Later.
</p><p><b>Madam M</b>: And now, I believe I have a prize to collect.

</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Right!
</p><p><b>Madam M</b>: Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. But...you still have one fight left.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: What do you mean?
</p><p><b>Madam M</b>: The crowd loved your show a little too much. People were placing hefty bets, much heftier than you can possibly imagine. Corneo's going to milk this for as much as he can.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Meaning what?
</p><p><b>Madam M</b>: You face and defeat Corneo's fighter of choice, and only then will you be declared winners of the tournament.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Hey! That wasn't the deal!
</p><p><b>Madam M</b>: Don't you think I know that!? (groans) You greedy bastard! Scum-sucking piece of shit festering asshole!
</p><p><b>Madam M</b>: (sighs) But that's the way it is. Corneo's the one who makes the rules around here. But if you win this match, Corneo will have to accept your victory. And the crowd will make sure he does.

She says you guys did pretty damn good, and that you should swing by her shop when you're done here. Got it? I was also hoping you might be interested in a few more matches here at the colosseum. Big events like the Corneo Cup are pretty sporadic, but there's always action if you wanna get a piece.

<p>(Upon talking to Madam M.)<br />
<b>Madam M</b>: You're here. Good. I have everything I need to get started. Just one thing before we do. You're <i>the</i> Cloud, right? Cloud the merc?
</p>
<ul><li>(If no Odd Jobs in Chapter 8 were completed.)<br /><b>Madam M</b>: Hah! Well that's what you call yourself I'm told, but what've you actually done for the people of Sector 5, hmm? There's this little thing called karma. How a person treats others dictates how they themselves should be treated. And believe me—I'll get you the dress that you earned.</li>
<li>(If a few Odd Jobs in Chapter 8 were completed.)<br /><b>Madam M</b>: I've heard a few stories about you helping out the people of Sector 5. If you don't mind me saying so, though, you could be doing a little bit more. The rule of karma is highly respected in the slums. A somewhat decent person deserves a somewhat decent dress. But really, let's not kid ourselves. Corneo's not even gonna look at what she's wearing.</li>
<li>(If all Odd Jobs in Chapter 8 were completed.)<br /><b>Madam M</b>: I'm told you did a wonderful job helping the people of Sector 5. You have a very impressive work ethic. It's like they say, "Good things come to those who work." What goes around, comes around—and in ways that might surprise you. I'm gonna put Aerith in the most gorgeous dress you've ever seen. It'll be a real jaw-dropper.</li></ul>

<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Yes".)<br /><b>Madam M</b>: All right, then. Let's get started. Beauty takes a lot of work and preparation, far more than you'd know. In the meantime, let me see, let me think...</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "No".)<br /><b>Madam M</b>: Huh!? Don't waste my time! If you have things to do, then get out there and do them!
<ul><li>(Upon interacting with Madam M a second time.)<br /><b>Madam M</b>: Like I said, once you change, you won't be able to leave town. Are you sure you're ready now?

That really won't do.<br /><b>Cloud</b>: Not interested.<br /><b>Madam M</b>: Then maybe you can show the town what you have to offer instead. Which is to say, why don't you try putting those finely honed mercenary skills of yours to good use here in Wall Market? I have a few little requests that you might be able to help out with. I gave that hand extra-special treatment. Now get out there and show me what you can do with it.
</p><p>(After the previous dialogue options conclude.)<br />
<b>Madam M</b>: And that's enough of that. Aerith, come with me.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Oh boy! I can't wait to see the dress!
</p><p><b>Madam M</b>: The dress is part of it, sure...but we'll also need to do something about that plain-Jane makeup and hairdo. This is gonna take some work.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Ouch! Well, I'll see you later, Cloud!

</p><p><b>Sam</b>: Kidding! If I know the madam—and I do—this was all her idea. I can see why. There's no denying you're skilled with a sword, but when it comes to damn near anything else, well...can't help but have my doubts. Ain't nothing wrong with that, but then there's nothing wrong with expanding your horizons neither. Seeking new experiences. Knowing the ways of this here world will help you to better protect her while you're in it. Reckon I've got a few solid gigs for you. Whaddya say? You game?

</p><p><b>Materia Vendor</b>: Could it be...? It is! The Sauce! The Sauce! Whoa... Never thought I'd live to see the day...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: It's just sauce. No big deal.
</p><p><b>Materia Vendor</b>: Don't sell yourself short! This is only given to one who is truly a man among men.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I know.
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Damn, bro! That's why you're such an awesome dude!
</p><p><b>Materia Vendor</b>: Oh, right... Hate to break it to you, but that thing you were looking for? Not here. It's long, long gone.
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: You shittin' me!?
</p><p><b>Materia Vendor</b>: Nope. Sorry. As I recall...the guy who runs the restaurant should have it.
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Ugh... Well, I guess we know where we're headed next. Come on, bro!
</p><p><b>Materia Vendor</b>: Well, that's that. Time to polish the ol' orbs, give them a spit shine so they positively sparkle!
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Restaurant up next, huh? Getting kinda hungry, actually. Do you smell that? I think it's coming from over there.

</p><p>(Upon talking to the Restaurant Owner.)<br />
<b>Restaurant Owner</b>: Welcome! Feel free to take any open seats.
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Sorry, we're not here to eat. The materia guy gave you something, yeah? We want it.
</p><p><b>Restaurant Owner</b>: Materia guy? Ohhh, you're here for <i>that</i>. I'm surprised—didn't take you for the type. Lemme ask you something. Either of you know anything about cooking?
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Nope. Never cooked once.
</p><p><b>Restaurant Owner</b>: That's too bad. For some reason, my food doesn't taste nearly as good as it used to. I was hoping one of you two might be able to help me figure it out. I've narrowed it down to the fridge, the stove, or the power supply, but I'm not sure what's to blame.
</p><p><b>On-screen</b>: Give him advice? (The higher level your magic materia, the better advice you'll give.)
</p><p>(Upon selecting "Yes".)<br />
<b>Johnny</b>: Man, I seriously have no idea what it could be. This sucks.

</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "Stove".)</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Fridge.")<br /><b>Johnny</b>: You know...your fridge might be broken. Maybe it's not keeping the ingredients cold enough.<br /><b>Restaurant Owner</b>: That so? You're an expert on all things ice? Okay then. Let's see if we can't fix this by fiddling with the temperature.<br /><b>Restaurant Owner</b>: Hmm... At a glance everything looks fine to me.</li>
<li>(Upon selecting "Power Supply".)</li></ul>
<p>(After the previous dialogue options conclude.)<br />
<b>Restaurant Owner</b>: Here! Eat up!
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Man, this looks great!
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: I can't... 
</p><p><b>Restaurant Owner</b>: What a shame. He seemed to be enjoying the meal so I wanted to ask him what he thought. Maybe next time. Anyway, thanks for your help. Oh—and here's a voucher with my apologies. Get the poor guy some medicine, will ya?
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Drugs...I need all the drugs right now! Outta the way! Outta the goddamn way! N-no... Can't go...
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Restaurant Owner again.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: Hey. About that thing we're looking for...
</p><p><b>Restaurant Owner</b>: Maybe I should fine-tune the flavor more—give it something extra to punch it up? Now what did I do with those spices I ordered from Wutai? I know there's some left...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I should help Johnny first.
</p><p>(Upon leaving the restaurant.)<br />
<b>Johnny</b>: Goodbye, cruel world...
</p><p><b>Pharmacist</b>: Hey! Off my doorstep, you bum! You're scaring away my customers.

</p><p><b>Pharmacist</b>: Hey, you. This yours?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Well...
</p><p><b>Pharmacist</b>: Oh, that a voucher you got there? Should've said something sooner. Come on in.
</p><p><b>Pharmacist</b>: What is it with today? People are dropping like flies.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Besides this dumbass?
</p><p><b>Pharmacist</b>: Loads of 'em. I got enough outstanding orders to fill a book. I was about to leave and make some deliveries, but...
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: I'm gonna hurl...
</p><p><b>Pharmacist</b>: Can't very well leave him alone now, can I? Hey, you're not doing much. Maybe you can deliver that medicine for me. You're, what, military or something, right? Then you must know a thing or two about dealing with the sick and injured.
</p><p><b>On-screen</b>: Deliver the medicine? (The higher level your cleansing materia, the more help you'll be.)
</p><p>(Upon selecting "Yes".)<br />
<b>Pharmacist</b>: You're a lifesaver—literally. So, lemme see, what needs delivering... Here—need you to deliver this to someone. You'll probably find this guy sprawled out on the ground somewhere. But make sure you check his symptoms before giving him meds.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Johnny.)<br />
<b>Johnny</b>: Can't...go on...
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Patient in the bar.)<br />
<b>Patient</b>: It was poisoned, I tell ya. The sick sonuvabitch puts poison in his food...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I've got meds. Lemme take a look at you.
</p><p><b>Patient</b>: Thanks, buddy! You saved my life. Here, it's not much, but it's yours. ...I'm grateful for your help but...do you think a guy could get a little privacy?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Should probably head back.
</p><p>(Upon returning to the pharmacy.)<br />
<b>Johnny</b>: And then there was this crazy-looking house, right? And it was all like trying to kill 'em! But then Cloud was all like bing, bang, boom!
</p><p><b>Pharmacist</b>: Your friend fought...a house? A house?
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Oh, hey! Welcome back, bro.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Better already?
</p><p><b>Pharmacist</b>: Yeah, and now he won't shut up. Anyway, how'd the deliveries go?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I did about as much as I could.
</p><p><b>Pharmacist</b>: Thanks for the help. And great work. Anyway, I promised it'd be worth your while. Here, Iv'e got something you're definitely gonna like.
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: What is it?
</p><p><b>Pharmacist</b>: Well, it belonged to the owner of the clothing store first. Heard from the cook that you boys been running all over town looking for this, am I right?
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Wait, we have? Hold up. What were we doing before all this? Oh shit! The inspiration!
</p><p><b>Pharmacist</b>: Bingo. Y'see, all us Wall Market entrepreneurs go way back. We get together for a game every night, bet all kinds of stuff. This found its way into the pool, and eventually into my possession. And now it's yours, 'cause hey—why the hell not. It's a VIP card, highly coveted and extremely rare. They're only given to a select few. Not that having it's gonna do you much good, but...
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Holy mother of... No way! Bro! We gotta get to the Honey—er, um, I mean Drunkards' on the double!
</p><p><b>Pharmacist</b>: Tell the old man I said hi!
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: C'mon, bro. Get a move on!
</p><p>(Upon reaching the bar entrance.)<br />
<b>Johnny</b>:  C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! I gotta know!
</p><p>(Upon talking to Johnny outside the bar.)<br />
<b>Johnny</b>: You still got the inspiration, right? You didn't lose it!?
</p><p>(Upon entering the bar.)<br />
<b>Johnny</b>: My heart is beating so fast, bro. Like it's gonna burst right outta my chest!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Clothing Store Owner.)<br />
<b>Johnny</b>: Hey, old dude. We're back!
</p><p><b>Clothing Store Owner</b>: Huh? Who're you? You're no son of mine. I think.
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Special delivery—just for you.
</p><p><b>Clothing Store Owner</b>: Hoho! My inspiration! You've returned to me at long last!
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Yo, is that...what I think it is...?
</p><p><b>Clothing Store Owner</b>: Oh you bet it is. And it was hard won! I sewed dresses day and night for those ladies, until I got what I was after. A Honeybee Inn VIP card!
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: I knew it!
</p><p><b>Clothing Store Owner</b>: Now make way for the VIP, boys. I don't wanna keep my ladies waiting any longer! But first—I should pick up a gift dress!
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Lead the way, old dude. We are comin'!
</p><p>(Upon entering the clothing store.)<br />
<b>Johnny</b>: Hey, how's about this?
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Clothing Store Owner's Son.)<br />
<b>Clothing Store Owner's Son</b>: Well, thanks for bringing him back. Can't imagine what you went through. Here, you earned it.
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Hey—you're coming, right bro? Get ready for a <i>real</i> Wall Market education!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'm done with this. You—you can do whatever the hell you want.
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: I get it, bro. You're scared. It's only natural for people to fear the unknown. It's a pity you're not gonna join us, but I swear to you, bro, as an aspiring Wall Market connoisseur... I'm gonna go in there and get as much inspiration as I can handle. For you, bro! For you! Because Cloud—you are my one true bro. Honeybee Inn, here I come!
</p><p><b>Clothing Store Owner</b>: Inspiration, here I come!
</p><p><b>Clothing Store Owner's Son</b>: Perfect example of how age has absolutely nothing to do with maturity.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Couldn't agree more. Should probably go see Sam again.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Clothing Store Owner's Son after completing the quest.)<br />
<b>Clothing Store Owner's Son</b>: My dad is one amazing designer! At least, he would be if he ever actually did some work.
</p><p>(While walking around the clothing store.)<br />
<b>Johnny</b>: Hey, how's about this?
</p><p><b>Clothing Store Owner</b>: What're you, crazy? This one's much better!
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Hot damn, old dude. Y-you made this one, too?
</p><p><b>Clothing Store Owner</b>: Now you see why all the ladies love and adore me? Tonight, you're with the VIP. I'll teach you all the right moves, all the ways to make 'em swoon!
</p><p><b>Johnny</b>: Yessir! I'll be your most loyal pupil, I swear it!
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Clothing Store Owner after completing the quest.)<br />
<b>Clothing Store Owner</b>: Huh? You wanna help us pick a dress? Alrighty, what d'you think of this real skimpy one here?

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Nothing I haven't seen before. That it for jobs?
</p><p><b>Sam</b>: Not exactly. I got one more favor to ask. You wanna get Tifa out, right?

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Not here for the cash. Tell me about Tifa.
</p><p><b>Sam</b>: Ahh, Tifa... She's something of a bombshell herself, huh? Girl keeps in shape, and boy does it show.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Hey.
</p><p><b>Sam</b>: Just making an observation, that's all. Anyway, seems like you're serious about getting the poor girl out of her predicament. I could tell easy enough by the way you fought back there.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Cut to the chase. Well? You helping or not?
</p><p><b>Sam</b>: Never said I would—opposite, even. Getting mixed up in other people's business isn't my way. Plus... As you are now, I reckon you could ride to her rescue without anybody's help. And that's the truth. You've changed since you first rolled into this here town. For the better.
</p><p><b>Sam</b>: At any rate, I've said all I'm gonna say. Your lady friend oughta be done changing by now, am I right? She ain't no Tifa, but she is a firecracker. Keep her waiting too long and she might just blow up in your face.

<p>(Upon approaching Mireille and the Stablehand.)<br />
<b>Stablehand</b>: The Angel of the Slums strikes again! It even says so on the card!
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: Oh, don't be an idiot! The Angel would never stoop so low as to steal from children! I'm telling you, I saw the real culprits.
</p><p><b>Stablehand</b>: You're saying there's multiple Angels on the loose?
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: What? No there's not!
</p><p><b>Stablehand</b>: Then the Angel of the Slums is their leader!?

</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: How can you!?
</p><p>(Upon talking to Mireille.)<br />
<b>Mireille</b>: Madam M told me about a merc. That you? Maybe you can help us sort this out. Some criminals have stolen a shipment of donations bound for the Leaf House. The fiends!
</p><p><b>Stablehand</b>: The culprit is none other than the notorious Angel of the Slums. People worship her as some kind of folk hero, but there's no denying she's the one that done did it! I mean, look at this calling card. "The Garden Angle Three"...? Well they must've meant to write "Guardian Angel"!
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: Oh, come on! "Garden angle"!? Listen to me. I guarantee this is not the work of the Angel. I saw it with my own eyes. Three shady-looking types wandering around, scouting their mark I bet.
</p><p><b>Stablehand</b>: Well if you're so sure then bring 'em here! Prove to me this wasn't the work of your beloved "Guardian Angel"!
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: You heard the man, merc. I've got to find those thieves to clear the Angel's name—and I need your help to do it. She would never, ever, do anything to harm the less fortunate.

</p><p><b>Beck</b>: Shut your trap, moron!
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: Hmph, you don't honestly thing that the beloved Angel of the Slums could be any of these three idiots, do you?
</p><p><b>Stablehand</b>: Nah, I recognize the masks. These guys're just small-time crooks who've been pestering folks around here for a minute. Should've listened to you earlier. Sorry about this.
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: Well, you should be sorry. I'll consider us square once you've taught these boys a lesson.
</p><p><b>Stablehand</b>: Deal. All right. Get moving!
</p><p><b>Beck</b>: Hey, watch it! Not so rough, you lummox.
</p><p><b>Butch</b>: Yeah, you lummox! You lum...mucks?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: So what about the donations? Do you need help taking them to the Leaf House?
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: Kind of you to offer, but I can manage on my own. I know these streets like the back of my hand. Better, even.
</p><p><b>Staff</b>: It's the Angel of the Slums! She took the don's stuff! He's gonna be pissed!
</p><p><b>Mireille</b>: Well, I'll be seeing ya. Thanks to you, we can put this mess behind us. I'm grateful.

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: What!?
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: It's pretty rare for Andrea to take a personal interest in someone. At least, that's what Madam M said. Trust me, this is gonna work out great.

</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: C'mon. Don't you wanna save Tifa?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Wait—
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: No can do, Cloud. This is our plan, and you'll learn to love it. So! Here's how I think we should approach him. Madam M said Andrea was a man who'd give anyone a fair chance to win him over. So I say we march right up to him, explain the situation, and see where that gets us. Sound good?

</p><p><b>Don Corneo</b>: So you're a man, huh? What are you three up to?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: <i>We'll</i> ask the questions. Like: why'd you have men in Sector 7 asking about Avalanche?
</p><p><b>Don Corneo</b>: Huh? Dunno what you're talking about.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Don't play dumb with me. Let's try again. Why did you have men in Sector 7 asking about Avalanche? Spill the beans or...
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'll cut 'em off.
</p><p><b>Don Corneo</b>: Alright, alright! I'll talk! I'll talk! Some guy with a gun for an arm—I was paid to find him!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Paid by who?
</p><p><b>Don Corneo</b>: I can't tell you that! They'd hunt me down like a dog!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Well you better...'cause if you don't...
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: I'll <i>rip</i> 'em off.
</p><p><b>Don Corneo</b>: It was the director of Public Security! Heidegger! It was Heidegger!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Shinra!? And what were they planning?
</p><p><b>Don Corneo</b>: Some things are better left unsaid, ya know!?
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: See, I'm not so sure they are. Better keep talking...
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Or I'll smash 'em.
</p><p><b>Don Corneo</b>: (squirms, laughs) Heh. Alright, you got me. I could never say no to a sexy girl. Since Avalanche blew up two reactors, Shinra's decided they ought to stamp them out, home base and all. And I mean "stamp out." By targeting the support pillar and blowing it up.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: The pillar?
</p><p><b>Don Corneo</b>: Did I stutter? The plate will come crashing down! (mimes explosion noises) It'll be Sector 6 all over again. I'm sure you've been there and seen the wreckage for yourself. So you know exactly what Sector 7's gonna look like!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: They wouldn't...
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Come on, guys! We gotta go!
</p><p><b>Don Corneo</b>: Before you do!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: No.
</p><p><b>Don Corneo</b>: Please! This won't take long!
</p><p><b>Don Corneo</b>: As everyone knows, villains only divulge their plans in a certain situation. But what is that situation?
</p><p><b>On-screen</b>: What is that situation?
</p>
<ul><li>(Upon selecting "When they're faced with certain death.")<br /><b>Cloud</b>: When they're faced with certain death, jackass.<br /><b>Don Corneo</b>: Not what we were looking for! But you can find it...in the sewers!</li>

<li>(Upon selecting "When they've lost their minds.")<br /><b>Cloud</b>: I dunno. When they've lost their minds?<br /><b>Don Corneo</b>: Close, but no cigar! Your parting gift...is in the sewers!</li>

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Another one of those lessons?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: An Avalanche saying, actually. We use them to move around the undercity. In emergencies.

</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: She's sleeping upstairs.

<b>Barret</b>: Marlene...my baby. Thank god.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Sh.
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: Shinra has my daughter now.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I'm sorry.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: No. I'm the one who asked her to go get Marlene. We'd only just met, but she was so kind and helpful. I...took advantage of her.
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: It's not your fault. It was only a matter of time before she ended up back there.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Because she's an Ancient. That it?
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: So she told you about that? She must trust you all a great deal...
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: Yes. Aerith is an Ancient. Probably the last one living. She's not my daughter. Not by blood, I mean. If that's what you were wondering...
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: About fifteen years ago... My husband, he'd been shipped off to fight on the front lines. But then I received a letter saying he'd be home for a bit. So when the day came, I went to the station to meet him... But...he didn't come. I couldn't help fearing the worst, even then...but I told myself his leave must've been postponed, that he'd been delayed. Every day I went, to wait, and to pray...
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: And that's how I met her. Her and her mother. I thought maybe they'd run away from Wall Market. Or that they were topsiders fallen on hard times. I'd seen that sort of thing a lot. "Take Aerith somewhere safe." Those were her mother's dying words. My husband had been away for so long, and I was lonely. So I convinced myself the safest place for the girl was with me.
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: It took no time at all for her to start feeling like family. She was a real chatterbox. She told me strange stories... Like how she and her mother had escaped from some sort of facility... And how she wasn't sad because her mother had just..."returned to their planet."
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Their planet, huh? Yeah, that sounds about right.
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: I didn't understand any of it at the time. When I asked if she meant one in the sky... She said no, this one. Right here. I mean...what can you say to that...?
</p><p><b>Aerith (flashback)</b>: Mommy, don't be sad.
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: That's what she said to me one day, out of the blue.
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: So I asked her, "What's wrong?"
</p><p><b>Aerith (flashback)</b>: A man you really, really love just died. His heart came a long way to say goodbye. But he couldn't stay, 'cause he had to return to the planet.
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: I didn't believe her, of course. And then, a few days later, I received a letter saying my husband had been killed in action. Things like that, she'd just know. It was a lot to deal with, but we were happy. And then came the knock.
</p><p><b>Aerith (flashback)</b>: Coming!
</p><p><b>Aerith (flashback)</b>: No... Go away!
</p><p><b>Tseng (flashback)</b>: Aerith... You know you're not just any little girl. You're a descendant of the Ancients.
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: I had no idea what he meant, so I said, "Who are the Ancients?"
</p><p><b>Tseng (flashback)</b>: They were the original stewards of the planet whose boundless knowledge and wisdom shall guide us to the promised land. Some believe the promised land to be a myth. Others, an allegory of sorts. But we take the words of the scriptures at face value, and believe it to be quite real. Which is why Shinra would like very much for Aerith to help us—
</p><p><b>Aerith (flashback)</b>: You're wrong! I'm not an Ancient!
</p><p><b>Tseng (flashback)</b>: But Aerith... Even when you're all alone, don't you hear voices whispering secrets?
</p><p><b>Aerith (flashback)</b>: No, never!
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: But all three of us knew that wasn't true. That man knew exactly who Aerith was, where she'd come from, and what she could do.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: They knew where she was, but they didn't just take her? Doesn't sound like the Turks I know.
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: She had to come willingly, otherwise it wouldn't work, they said. That's why...even if they did take her away, I'm sure she's still being treated like a guest... And that they'll send her straight back home once they get what they need.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: I doubt it.
</p><p><b>Elmyra</b>: You're not planning anything, are you? Don't make things worse than they already are. If I lost her too, I don't know if I could... if I could ever... Just don't.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud. Maybe she's right about this. Maybe they'll let Aerith go when it's all over. Maybe...we'd be better off waiting a little while.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Let's head back to Sector 7. Got things to take care of. Like...checking up on the bar.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Yeah.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Okay.

For all their claims about fighting for the slums...they're nothing more than pawns of Wutai—puppets dancing to the tune of their foreign masters! And that's the truth!

<p>(Upon talking to Madam M.)<br />
<b>Madam M</b>: If it isn't Cloud.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: We're looking for a way topside. Know one?
</p><p><b>Madam M</b>: Good luck with that. Security's so tight these days that not even a gnat could slip through. Wall Market's in a sorry state, too. Corneo's men are turning it upside down looking for Avalanche.
</p><p><b>Madam M</b>: Hmm? The man with a gun for an arm...
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: What? Got a problem?
</p><p><b>Madam M</b>: No, but you might. Corneo's men are searching high and low for an Avalanche member who fits your description. Shinra has placed a very impressive bounty on you and your friends' heads. And a lot of people are looking to get rich.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Ain't these fools got anything better to do?
</p><p><b>Madam M</b>: You should also know that you and that arm of yours were spotted in the Sector 5 slums. Apparently, you were loitering in a rather lovely flower garden?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Oh yeah...? Wait!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: This is bad. Really bad.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Let's move!
</p><p>(Upon talking to Madam M again.)<br />

</p><p>(Upon talking to her.)<br />
<b>Housemother</b>: I don't know what business they have with Aerith, but I know it can't be anything good.
</p><p>(Upon approaching the Corneo Lackeys.)<br />

</p><p><b>Hoodlum</b>: Oh, you bet your ass he'll come back. Now shut up and keep your eyes peeled.
</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey</b>: Yeah, yeah. Well, not like we're goin' anywhere with this thing, anyway.
</p><p><b>Hoodlum</b>: How's he holdin' up?
</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey</b>: Beats me. His face creeps me out.
</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey</b>: Better watch where he points that thing.
</p><p><b>Hoodlum</b>: Better watch your mouth, bitch. You don't wanna give him a reason to hold a grudge, ya know?
</p><p>(Upon reaching the Corneo Lackeys.)<br />

</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Heard you punks were lookin' for me. Didn't wanna keep you waitin'.
</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey</b>: Wait! You!?

</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey'</b>: Uh, sure!
</p><p><b>Hoodlum</b>: Hah! Y'all are in for a world of hurt now! Hack 'em to bis, y'hear me! Leave the faces, though. Shinra ain't gonna give us the bounty otherwise!

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: That's right. You'll tell everyone we were never here—that the rumors were bullshit. And if we hear about you, or any of your friends, coming round here ever again...

<p>(Upon talking to Damon.)<br />
<b>Damon</b>: It's you, my good merc! What brilliant timing you have! Oh, hello there—it is a pleasure to meet you both. I'm a journalist for the Daily Buzz.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: The Daily Buzz? You mean that trash filled with Shinra fluff pieces?
</p><p><b>Damon</b>: Well, yes, that's fair—but we do get a lot of inside information because of our close ties with the company. (laughs) Curious? Here's the scoop. A certain division of Shinra—that shall remain nameless—was planning to seize Corneo's assets. But before they could, the key to his secret vault within which his misbegotten gains were securely tucked away...was stolen! And my sources tell me that the thief...is the undercity's beloved hero: the Angel of the Slums! The unidentified bandit who's been targeting anyone with ties to Shinra or Corneo! Yes, that Angel of the Slums has struck again! Well? Do I have your undivided attention now?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Kinda, but hurry it up. We don't have time for a three-act play.
</p><p><b>Damon</b>: Then I'll make this quick. So! My good merc. You do remember where the Angel's hideout is, right?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Do you remember the death threat she left there?
</p><p><b>Damon</b>: Oh, that. I've decided to seek the silver lining in this case. If the Angel of the Slums deigns to taken an interest in a humble reporter, then that itself would be a story!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: ...What are you asking?
</p><p><b>Damon</b>: If you recover the stolen key, feel free to help yourself to the contents of Corneo's vault. All I want is knowledge—the identity of the Angel. So if you happen to learn anything of value, I'd be tremendously grateful to you if you passed it along.

The Space and Aeronautics Division has taken rocket systems developed for military applications and adapted them to a different purpose: the search for new precious resources in the infinite reaches of space." That being said...since we have plenty of mako at the present, those plans are currently on hold. It's a...bit of a shame, really.

<b>Hojo</b>: (sighs) Uh, welcome to Shinra headquarters. My duties as director of Research and Development are, in all likelihood, far beyond your ability to comprehend. So, there will be no presentation, as it would be a waste of my time and yours. But rest assured, we are making great strides. Albeit not at this particular moment, because I'm filming this rubbish instead. I believe I've wasted enough of my precious time as it is. Science waits for no one, after all. So—good day.

<b>Reeve</b>: Welcome to the Shinra Building. Our mission here at Urban Planning is to supply the residents of Midgar with energy created from mako. We also take pride in maintaining public infrastructure—the pillars and railways that run all throughout the city. Currently, we are working to construct an intra-plate expressway. When this project has been completed, it will provide much easier access to numerous locations all across Midgar. We appreciate your patience and understanding in the meantime.

<b>On-screen</b>: Mako Energy Exhibit
</p><p><b>Guide</b>: This is Midgar—our home—recreated in 1/10000 scale. As you can see here...the eight mako reactors form a ring around the center of our city...and keep Midgar running day and night. The mako which flows beneath our feet is a truly limitless resource. At Shinra, we have developed technologies to extract it...and transform it into the fuel and electricity that powers everything we do. Thanks to the miracle of mako energy, our lives are richer and better than ever before. Mako keeps our lights on at night, and made Midgar into the city that never sleeps. A triumph of technology and testament to man's potential.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Nothin' but a buncha lies!
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Except that mako <i>has</i> made people's lives better.

<b>Barret</b>: This place is empty.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: The hell—!?
</p><p><b>Guide</b>: In the distant past, our planet was home to a people we call the Ancients. Many millennia before we discovered mako, these precursors were already pioneering its use. Somehow they learned of the great reservoir of energy pulsing beneath their feet. And once they had...the Ancients developed the means to harness this bountiful energy and bend it to their will. The fruits of their labors have survived to this very day in the form of certain kinds of materia. Their scripture, too, has endured: "We who are born of the planet, with her we speak. Her flesh we shape." "Unto her promised land shall we one day return. By her loving grace and providence may we take our place in paradise."
</p><p><b>Guide</b>: Alas, the Ancients themselves are long gone. Two thousand years ago, a meteor brought an end to their civilization. But before their fiery end, did the Ancients find their promised land? Even now, we have only to wonder. Times have changed—and the Shinra Electric Power Company is committed to changing and evolving with them. Like the Ancients, we have harnessed the power of mako.
</p><p><b>Guide</b>: Are they out there, watching us? Waiting for us to join them in some blessed corner of the world—a green and verdant land, where boundless mako energy will provide for our every need? Shinra is working for you, to fulfill the hope of the Ancients and lead us to that promised land. We shall not rest until our dream is realized.

</p><p><b>Domino</b>: Just say "mayor" to the guy, and if he goes "the best!" with gusto, then you've found your man. You got it?

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: So, can you tell us anything about this collaborator?
</p><p><b>Hart</b>: Certainly, I can do just that. But a man in my position must conduct his affairs with discretion. Which is to say that that which has been requested cannot be freely given...if you take my meaning.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: You want money!
</p><p><b>Hart</b>: Disclosing confidential information entails considerable risk. Due compensation is to be expected. In this particular instance, that would amount to ten thousand gil.

</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: Hmm. You're the spitting image of her now. I regret it to this day. If she had only trusted me instead of trying to run, it could have played out quite differently.

</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: The mayor.
</p><p><b>Shinra Employee</b>: Hm? Are you looking for the mayor? He's not on this floor...
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Shinra Employee on the right side of the Shinra Combat Simuatlor.)<br />
<b>Shinra Employee</b>: You're military, right? Can you give me any tips for doing better in the sim?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: The mayor.
</p><p><b>Shinra Employee</b>: Mare? I need to be tough like a horse?
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Server at the Item Shop.)<br />

</p><p>(Upon talking to the Collaborator, listed at first as Shinra Employee, in front of the Shinra Combat Simulator entrance.)<br />
<b>Collaborator</b>: You work here? I don't recognize you. Can I help you with something?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: The mayor.
</p><p><b>Collaborator</b>: ...Is the best! I was told to expect you. Need access to upper floors, right?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: That's right.
</p><p><b>Collaborator</b>: Before I trust you with this keycard, I need to see what you can actually do.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Say what?
</p><p><b>Collaborator</b>: Do you know what would happen if you got caught? We're putting our lives on the line here. Prove you're worth it. We have a state-of-the-art combat simulator. It can provide a real challenge, let me tell you. If you beat the sim, then the keycard is all yours.
</p><p>(Upon talking to the Collaborator after beating the "Three-Person Team vs. Mayor Is Best" challenge.)<br />
<b>Collaborator</b>: All right, I've seen enough. I'm a man of my word. Here. This keycard will grant you access to the 64th floor. You can use the elevator to get there. Once you're up there, just what is it you plan on doing?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: We came to get one of our friends. She's being held in a research lab somewhere.
</p><p><b>Collaborator</b>: A lab? Then she must be with Professor Hojo. It won't be easy to get to her. Access to R&amp;D is limited to authorized personnel only.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: We'll find a way in. Know where we can find Hojo?
</p><p><b>Collaborator</b>: A board meeting is scheduled to start soon. It's being held in the main conference room. President Shinra, Professor Hojo, and the other directors will be in attendance.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Think they like surprises? We can even take the president as a hostage. Think of the leverage!
</p><p><b>Collaborator</b>: Try it, and security will be on your asses in seconds.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: We need to find out what they're planning.
</p><p><b>Collaborator</b>: So you want to spy on their meeting? Hmm, I have an idea. Head to the men's restroom. You can climb into the air ducts there. They go all the way to the conference room.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Thanks for the tip.

I took the liberty of hacking into the executives' private network to monitor your progress through the building. I will support you in any way that I can. I sense a surge in trust. We should keep this brief to avoid suspicion.

</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: If I may, sir, there was one other matter.

</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Dammit!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Barret.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Yeah, yeah, I know. We came here to save Aerith. That's our first priority.

</p><p><b>Shinra Employee (2)</b>: ...You sure?
</p><p><b>Shinra Employee (1)</b>: Pretty sure...
</p><p>(Upon interacting with the second vent.)<br />
<b>Shinra Employee</b>: Depending on the board's decision, we may start two projects simultaneously: rebuilding the plate and the city. Members of the Urban Planning Division will likely take point on both. Director Tuesti has ordered teams to come up with three-, five-, and ten-year plans. Each team needs to come up with a detailed proposal and schedule. We're going to have to put a lot of man-hours into this, so we'll need to start ASAP. Does anyone have any questions at all? If not, then we'll wait for the director to return.

</p><p><b>Palmer</b>: He was as close to me as you are now! The shock of it made me spill my tea!
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: Enough already! If there are intruders in the building, my men will deal with them.
</p><p><b>Palmer</b>: But Mister President! Sir! I swear to you—
</p><p><b>President Shinra</b>: Reeve.
</p><p><b>Reeve</b>: Sir. I have the damage assessment for Sector 7, and I'm afraid the figures are catastrophic—
</p><p><b>President Shinra</b>: Spare us the doom and gloom. Was there anything else?
</p><p><b>Reeve</b>: Uh... Well sir, I've also drafted a reconstruction plan—
</p><p><b>President Shinra</b>: That will not be needed. Not with the Ancient in our custody once more.
</p><p><b>Reeve</b>: Uh...with respect, sir, I don't see how—
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: Two words, Reeve: "Neo Midgar." Hm.
</p><p><b>President Shinra</b>: In their promised land...we will build a new mako-powered metropolis.
</p><p><b>Reeve</b>: Mister President! We still don't know for sure that the promised land even—
</p><p><b>President Shinra</b>: Professor Hojo.
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: The test results were within expectations. The specimen is somewhat lacking compared to her pure-blood mother, but for our purposes she should more than suffice.
</p><p><b>President Shinra</b>: So, she can lead us to the promised land?
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: Well, Mister President, that remains to be seen. I would like your permission to secure her cooperation through more "forceful" means. Forceful yet gentle. She is a precious resource that must be handled with care.
</p><p><b>Scarlet</b>: Personally, I've never had a problem with torture.
</p><p><b>Heidegger</b>: My armory is at your disposal, should you require anything.
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: I...had something more...psychological in mind. Better to scar the psyche than mar the flesh.
</p><p><b>Palmer</b>: (laughs)
</p><p><b>President Shinra</b>: Proceed as you see fit. However. You will not make the same mistake twice. Is that clear?
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: If I may, Mister President, I have an idea how we might mitigate the risks. Simply put, we could have the Ancient reproduce. In the absence of a second specimen, we would need to identify an alternative mate. I would start with candidates from SOLDIER. These would of course include S and G types. Quite frankly, there's no telling what kind of properties a crossbred specimen might possess. So— What say you all?
</p><p><b>President Shinra</b>: If there is nothing else.
</p><p><b>Reeve</b>: Mister President!
</p><p><b>President Shinra</b>: Meeting adjourned.
</p><p><b>Reeve</b>: Please, sir!

</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: Oh? "Take her back," you say? Correct me if I am wrong, but did the girl not come here of her own free will? Or do you mean to tell me that she is your "personal property"?

</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: What was that? An explosion?
</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: HQ's running the show this time. They're raising hell to try and flush out the president.
</p><p><b>Domino</b>: This complicates matters. That explosion just now put the whole building on high alert.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: So now we're trapped in here?
</p><p><b>Domino</b>: No need to panic, little lady. See? You can still move freely within Hojo's laboratory.
</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: Find a way to the roof. An Avalanche chopper will come to extract you.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: HQ's bailing us out? I doubt it. Not after all the shit we've pulled.
</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: I asked them really nicely! Like, super-duper nicely!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Thanks, Wedge.
</p><p><b>Wedge</b>: Just get to the roof, okay?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: I didn't ask him to do any of that.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Yeah, well, I'm glad he did.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Huh? Heh. I'mma still chew him out for it later.
</p><p>(While following Barret and Red XIII.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Anyway, we gotta get to the roof, right?
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: Then we can use the same elevator that Hojo did.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: That elevator. Was it this way?
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: Yes. His odor still lingers.
</p><p>(Upon using the elevator.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: What happened here?

</p><p>(Upon reaching the VR simulator in <i>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</i> in Hard Mode.)<br />
<b>Chadley</b>: Cloud… We’ve added a new individual’s data to the combat simulator. I can’t divulge any details…but I can say its existence is both highly-classified and extremely dangerous. To be completely honest…I had some misgivings about implementing it. Even now, I’m still not entirely sure I made the right decision. However, I do believe that engaging it in combat will yield vital information. And who better to extract that information than you, Cloud? If you’re willing to try, I’d appreciate the help.
</p><p>(Upon defeating Pride and Joy Prototype in Chadley's VR simulator in Hard Mode.)<br />
<b>Chadley</b>: Now that my research is at long last complete... I believe that it's time I told you the truth about myself. I'm...not human. I'm a cyborg created to serve as Hojo's assistant. I was given knowledge and power beyond that of a human... ...But I was robbed of free will, bound to obey the whims of my master. But when we met, Cloud, I sensed something within you—something I knew would allow me to break free of my chains. By identifying and studying a subject with infinite potential such as yourself... I could adhere to the directives imposed upon me...all the while pursuing my plans for independence in secret. Your combat data provided me the vital information that I required to enhance my basic functionality... This is the result. Through my research and with your assistance, I have freed myself from Hojo's bondage.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Cool.
</p><p><b>Chadley</b>: I cannot thank you enough for your help. You've given me the power to finally live my life on my own terms.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: So...what are you gonna do now?
</p><p><b>Chadley</b>: I'm not sure. It's all a big, wonderful mystery. It's nice not knowing something for a change...
</p><p>(Upon beginning "Three-Person Team vs. The Immaculate One".)<br />
<b>Weiss</b>: They shall be slashed, strangled, and slaughtered. Beaten, stabbed, and crushed. Garroted and impaled. Shot and executed…without mercy. Now…let the hunt begin!
</p><p>(Upon defeating Weiss.)<br />
<b>Weiss</b>: So this is what’s possible when you transcend the flesh? Good to know. (laughs) Either way, see you in Deepground.
</p><p>(Upon using the elevator.)<br />
<b>Cloud</b>: Let's go.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Right.

</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Hell is this place?
</p><p><b>Red XIII</b>: Hojo's treasure. Shinra's dark secret.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: What I wouldn't give to burn it all down...but we need to get to the roof.
</p><p>(Upon reaching the bridge.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: What is that...?
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Jenova.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth (flashback)</b>: Mother... Together we will reclaim our world.
</p><p><b>Tifa (flashback)</b>: I'm <i>sick</i> of this! I'm sick of all of this!
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Cloud?
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Tell me. Is it really you?
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Don't deny me. Embrace me.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: (screams)
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Cloud!
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: A touching reunion.
</p><p><b>Hojo</b>: Very, very good! And thus is the hypothesis proven correct! I can only hope you will continue <i>not</i> to disappoint. (laughs)

<p><b>On-screen</b>: End of the Road
</p><p>(Upon approaching the end.)<br />
<b>Barret</b>: Okay, asshole, let's—
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Don't.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: And you... You're <i>wrong</i>.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Those who look with clouded eyes see nothing but shadows.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Everything about you is <i>wrong</i>.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: All born are bound to her. Should this world be unmade, so too shall her children.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: The world won't end today. But you... You will.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Listen.
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: Destiny come.
</p><p><b>Zack</b>: We drag our asses all this way...and this is the welcome we get.
</p><p><b>Zack</b>: Boy, oh boy... The price of freedom is steep.
</p><p><b>Zack</b>: Embrace your dreams. And, whatever happens... Protect your honor...as a SOLDIER! Come and get it!
</p><p><b>Sephiroth</b>: I'm waiting, Cloud.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: This is the point of no return.
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Destiny's crossroads.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Then why did you stop me?
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: I'm not really sure.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: What will we find on the other side?
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: Freedom. Boundless, terrifying freedom. Like a great, never-ending sky. What you heard just now were the voices of the planet. Those born into this world. Who lived and who died. Who returned. They're howling in pain.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: Because of him? Sephiroth?
</p><p><b>Aerith</b>: They... Their words...they don't reach him. All these moments and memories, precious and fleeting...they're like rain rolling off his back... And when they're gone, he won't cry...or shout...or anything. He'd tell you that he only cares about the planet. That he'd do everything in his power to protect and preserve it. But this isn't the way it's supposed to be. There's no greater threat to the planet than him. Sephiroth has to be stopped. He has to be. And that's why... I'm asking you to help me. I know that together, we can do this. But if we do... We'll be changing more than fate itself. If we succeed...if we win...we'll be changing ourselves... I guess...maybe, that's why I hesitated.
</p><p><b>Cloud</b>: You said it yourself. He has to be stopped. And frankly, I've heard enough howling for a lifetime.

<p>(Upon talking to Nayo the first time.)<br />
<b>Nayo</b>: You must be tired from your trip. Why don't you get some rest?
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: With all the noise in this city? Im-freakin'-possible. How about you tell me where in the Shinra Building they're keeping that materia instead. Don't hold out on me now. I know you know.
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: Actually...I kind of don't. At least, not an exact location. All I know is that Shinra—for most purposes—treats materia as a weapon. Which means the Advanced Weaponry Division probably deals with it. And since that's in the basement...
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: I see... So... Shinra hides its top secret materia in the basement. (chuckles) You won't have to wait much longer, my precious...I promise.
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: Just be careful, will you? Please?
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: Oh yeah, you should introduce yourself to Billy Bob. He knows a thing or two about the Shinra Building.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Billy Bob the first time.)<br />
<b>Billy Bob</b>: My teeth...
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: You're welcome. So, the materia I'm looking for is in the Shinra Building, right? And where is that, exactly?
</p><p><b>Billy Bob</b>: (chuckles) Ignorance truly is bliss, huh?
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: What did you just say?
</p><p><b>Billy Bob</b>: Haha, didn't mean to offend you. Of course, you probably knew this already, but there's a whole other city built on the plate above us. Shinra Building's right in the middle. You can't miss it.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Oh, <i>that</i> one. Why didn't you say so?
</p><p><b>Billy Bob</b>: Now, if ya wanna get topside, ya first gotta get outta the slums. And for help with that, you should talk to Polk.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Polk the first time.)<br />
<b>Polk</b>: You look kinda nervous.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: I just wanna make sure I have the plan down pat. You know, like how to get up top and all that.
</p><p><b>Polk</b>: Huh, well... If you had an ID, you'd normally just take the train up there. But with all the commotion going on, that's not really an option. Security's on high alert. If you ask me, your best bet is to sit tight and wait for things to settle down some.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Sit tight? But I wanna go now...
</p><p><b>Polk</b>: Be my guest, then—go get killed.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Harsh.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Nayo the second time.)<br />
<b>Nayo</b>: Sonon's still not back? Must be in Wall Market, then.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: What's Wall Market?
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: Let's just say it's a place for people with "mature tastes."
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Mature tastes...
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: There's lots of different establishments. It's...kinda hard to explain.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: No, I think I get it. Like bars filled with smoke so thick you can't even see, and drinks so bitter you wanna spit 'em right back out!
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: Uh...
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Where everyone gets drunk and complains about how "Kids just don't understand the value of hard work. They'll be the death of society." Ugh, how can they not see that <i>they're</i> the ones destryoing it!?
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: (chuckles)
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Wutai's got a place like that, where grown-ups drink their lives away. It's called the "Happy Turtle."
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: Interesting. There's a Happy Turtle in Midgar as well.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b> Huh?
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: I don't know where exactly, because I've never actually been, but I do see their flyers from time to time.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: You do, huh? (gasp) They're taking down Midgar one citizen at a time!
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: (chuckles)
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: I salute you, Happy Turtle!
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: Come to think of it... There's a man who goes around putting up flyers for the bar. People call him "Old Snapper." And he doesn't dress like your average Midgar male. Might be from Wutai.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: I oughta find him! Man deserves some Da-chao beans.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Billy Bob the second time.)<br />
<b>Billy Bob</b>: You know about the VR combat simulation module, right?
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Huh? Uh...course I do! Why wouldn't I? It's that thing that...stimulates...modulation.
</p><p><b>Billy Bob</b>: Hm. (chuckles) Kinda. It's a machine that puts you in a virtual world where you can practice fighting all you want. There's even a portable version of it. Guy around the corner has one.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Uh-huh...
</p><p><b>Billy Bob</b>: Hardly ever see technology that cutting-edge down here. So whaddya say? Wanna try it?
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: I really don't have time to be playin' around with some stimulator. But, just to be polite, I guess I'll take it for a spin.
</p><p><b>Billy Bob</b>: The guy's name is Chadley. He's over by the neighborhood watch. If you ever feel like some virtual training, I'm sure he'd be happy to help.
</p><p>(Upon talking to Polk a second time.)<br />
<b>Polk</b>: You look about ready to die of boredom. Wanna play Fort Condor?
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: "Fort...Condor"?
</p><p><b>Polk</b>: (chuckles) I shoulda known. It hasn't been out long, so there's no way you Ws would've heard of it.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Uh, yes I have! And what's more, I'm awesome at it. I'll whoop you so hard, you'll wonder if you ever knew the rules!
</p><p><b>Polk</b>: For my benefit, then, lemme go over them...
</p><p>(After beating Polk in a match.)<br />
<b>Polk</b>: Damn, Yuffie! How'd you do that? You totally kicked my ass!
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: You mean you didn't lose on purpose? ...Wow.
</p><p><b>Polk</b>: (chuckles) Well, if you're looking for a challenge, the undercity's got no shortage of serious players.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: I've kinda got better things to do.
</p><p><b>Polk</b>: Sure 'bout that? Word is if you beat the grandmaster, you can win some serious cash—materia, too.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Materia!?
</p><p><b>Polk</b>: That's right. But you should know the hardcore competitors won't give you the time of day till you've proven yourself.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Whatever! Bring it on!
</p><p>(After talking to all three twice.)<br />
<b>Yuffie</b>: Ugh... Al this talking's giving me a headache. I'm gonna go do some recon.
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: I won't stop you. Just don't go too far, okay?

<ul><li>Okay, everyone, listen up! Time for "Stamp: The Loyal Little Helper."</li>
<li>"Bow wow! I'm Stamp, the good boy who never stops helping! Cap'n's given me a very important mission: to buy bread for tonight's dinner!"</li>
<li>So with his super-duper nose, Stamp went into town to sniff out a bakery. He went a-sniff-sniff here, and a-sniff-sniff there! Even finding milk, sausage, and cake didn't distract him.</li>
<li>Using his trusty nose, Stamp was able to find the best, most yummiest bakery in the whole city! And from that bakery, he picked out the best, most yummiest-smelling loaf of bread! Thinking about how pleased the captain would be, Stamp went trotting back to base, wagging his tail, and singing a happy song.</li>
<li>But on the road home, he came across a moogle crying all by himself. "What's wrong?" Stamp asked the forlorn little fellow. "I'm so hungry. I haven't eaten in ages, kupo," the moogle sniffled. "Never fear, Stamp's here! And I know just how to help." So Stamp gave the crying moogle his loaf of bread. "Thank you, kupo," the moogle exclaimed, his pom bouncing excitedly.</li>
<li>Then Stamp waved goodbye and returned to base. When he got there, he went straight to the captain and told him what had happened. The captain was very proud of Stamp. Helping that moogle was the right thing to do. "Who's a good boy," the captain laughed, as he gave Stamp a good scratch behind the ears. And Stamp let out a happy bark, for he knew that he was the good boy. The end.</li>

</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Speaking of drinking...you been to the Happy Turtle? If you're part of Operation Down-in-One, I take it back. I am <i>there</i> next time you go. Don't worry, I can do adult stuff just fine.

</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Uh... I guess so?
</p><p><b>Chadley</b>: I'm sure you'll "kick butt"!
</p><p>(Upon choosing the "Fort Condor" option from Chadley's menu.)

<ul><li>(After beating Chadley.)<br /><b>Chadley</b>: That was quite the performance, Yuffie! Thanks to you, my hypothesis has been substantiated.<br /><b>Yuffie</b>: Your hypo-thingy's what now?<br /><b>Chadley</b>: Substantiated. I was testing security measures against Wutaian espionage operations. By offering a reward, I surmised I could accelerate the rate of adoption, which would, in turn—<br /><b>Yuffie</b>: Yeah, yeah, skip to the end!<br /><b>Chadley</b>: (sighs) My apologies. What I meant to say was this: The money and the materia are yours. Do with them as you please.<br /><b>Yuffie</b>: did you say "materia"!? So...<i>you're</i> the Grandmaster!? Whodda thunk! (laughs) How does it feel, Shinra—to see the whole of Midgar brought to its knees by the Amazing Yuffie!<br /><b>Chadley</b>: Heh. Your capacity to remain undeterred and overcome adversity is commendable. You are truly a worthy competitor. When I next test a hypothesis, I would be honored if you would agree to... ..."kick its butt"!<br /><b>Yuffie</b>: Anytime!</li>
<li>(After losing to CHadley.)<br /><b>Chadley</b>: Shame; it was a close match. Maybe next time.</li></ul>
<p>(Upon talking to Chadley again before beating him.)<br />
<b>Chadley</b>: Would you care to assist in my research by joining me in a game or two of Fort Condor?

<p>(Upon talking to Old Snapper.)<br />
<b>Old Snapper</b>: Oh the joy and cheer that await at the Happy Turtle...
</p><p><b>Old Snapper</b>: Oho! Greetings, softshell. So, how many of those flyers didja find?
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Wha?
</p><p><b>Old Snapper</b>: Ahem! Collect just six flyers for the Happy Turtle, and a one-of-a-kind prize could be yours! Ring any bells?
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Nope.
</p><p><b>Old Snapper</b>: Well then! Allow me to explain. The Happy Turtle's running a contest. And the rules are simple. All you have to do is collect six of our fabulous flyers from around Sector 7...and you'll earn yourself a prize sure to delight even the dourest diamondback! Hah hah! Sadly, a handful of locals have taken to acting like stinkpots toward anything Wutaian, 'speciall since the bombings. Some've even gone so far as to tear down my poor posters. Little wonder nobody's won yet.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Bummer.
</p><p><b>Old Snapper</b>: (sighs) Which leaves me in a pretty predicament... But hey, my pain might be your gain. By collecting just a handful of flyers, you could be the first, and—at this rate—the only winner of the most testudinarious contest in Midgar's history! This here's a sample of one of our ads. Breathtaking, isn't it? Now it's up to you to find all six. Leave no shell unturned, no pond unplumbed!
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: That prize is as good as mine!
</p><p><b>Old Snapper</b>: Ah, since you're here. You wouldn't happen to have any condor coins on you, wouldja? This job may keep a shell over my head, but my real passion's coin collecting. I'd gladly party with some oddities and commodities in exchange for those little beauts.

</p><p><b>Marle</b>: But cut your losses, honey. Unless you like your men silent and emotionally unavailable. Merc's built a wall around himself so damn high, even he can't see over it.

Well, I don't plan on movin' from Midgar anytime soon, so once your shell's seen a bit more wear and tear, make sure to come on back. Whip you up the finest food and drink this side of Wutai.

<b>Nayo</b>: Yuffie? Where are you going?

<b>Sonon</b>: So Nayo, where we headed?
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: To pick up your IDs. There's no way to get topside without 'em.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: But I thought Zhijie was getting our High-D's. What happened with that?
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: He is, but those are different. It takes more than one ID—or even two—to survive in this town. Don't forget, Midgar was built by Shinra, for Shinra.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Those tyrants!
</p><p><b>Sonon</b>: Put the claws away, Boss. Least while we're in Shinra territory.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Reowr!
</p><p><b>Sonon</b>: Whoa.
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: So, Yuffie, what do you think of the undercity?
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Way too crowded. I can't stand it. Ugh, and the stench! How can anyone live here?
</p><p><b>Sonon</b>: Gotta agree with you about the smell, but you get used to it quick enough.
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: And the crowds stop bothering you eventually. The place can grow on you if you give it a chance.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Uh...wait a second. Are you actually saying you like it here? I thought you hated it.
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: Midgar isn't the enemy—Shinra is. I know Ws don't really see the distinction, but...we do.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Then what was that stuff on the news? About a reactor blowin' up and all. No way that was an accident. It had to be Avalanche.
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: Shh!
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Sorry...
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Uh, what's up?
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: Those guys there are from the splinter cell.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Splinter cell?
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: They used to be with Avalanche, but left after a "policy dispute."
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Well, look who it is. Lovin' your work! So how many reactors is that now? Wait... Where's Cloud?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: We lost him.
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: You what?
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: He <i>will</i> be okay though...right?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Well...of course he will! A little fall ain't gonna stop a hard-ass like him. He'll come swaggerin' back before long, you mark my words.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Yeah...I guess he will.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Now can we talk about President Shithead? Spoutin' all that crap about us!? That lyin' son of a bitch! Working for Wutai!? Avalanche ain't nobody's—
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Barret.
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Speakin' of sons of bitches...I heard the Wall Market's very own Don Corneo has his stooges out lookin' for ya.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Huh?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Is that so?
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Don't got time for no low-level mobsters. We got Shinra in our sights.
</p><p><b>Barret</b>: Tifa. You and I both know this is far from over. Right? Might as well get some rest—while we still can.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: Right.
</p><p><b>Tifa</b>: You know what? I think I am gonna look into this.
</p><p><b>Biggs</b>: Good luck out there.
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: They're the ones who blew up the reactors.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Cool. Should we say hi?
</p><p><b>Sonon</b>: Nah, better not. After what they've done, you gotta assume Shinra's on their tail. Should keep our distance.
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: Yeah. My thoughts exactly.
</p><p>(While following Nayo again.)<br />
<b>Nayo</b>: The people in the splinter cell, they couldn't care less about collateral damage...long as Shinra goes down.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: So, what's wrong with that? Sounds good to me.
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: We're not out to blow Midgar up or tear it down—we want to save it from Shinra. Look around. Nine outta ten of the people living here are innocent bystanders. We can't level their home to take down one company.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Well, that company almost leveled <i>our</i> home, and they've gotta learn their lesson.
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: Yeah, I get that.
</p><p><b>Sonon</b>: Gotta admit, I'm surprised you agreed to work with us.
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: We're just doing what we think is necessary...to build a brighter future. That's all there is to it.
</p><p><b>Sonon</b>: In other words, you're working with us so we don't work with your old buddies—knowing what would happen if we did.
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: Uh, can we table this for later, maybe? Not sure now's the best time for heavy topics.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Yeah, couldn't agree more. Consider it tabled!
</p><p>(Upon talking to Nayo outside the gate.)<br />
<b>Nayo</b>: So...what exactly does this "ultimate materia" do? I'm guessing you have big plans for it?
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Like after we steal it? Well, the more materia you have, the stronger you are, right? So once we've got the <i>ultimate</i> materia, we'll be stronger than anyone!
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: I guess you will...
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: (chuckles) It's gonna be awesome!
</p><p><b>Sonon</b>: And not just that. By sneaking into Shinra HQ and snatching their most prized possession from under their noses...not only will we deal a massive blow to their morale...but we'll prove to them that while Wutai might be down, we're not out. That the gist of it, Boss?
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Uh, sure is! 
</p><p>(Upon walking through the gate.)<br />
<b>Corneo Lackey (1)</b>: See that one?
</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey (2)</b>: Well hello there, hot stuff... How'd ya like a shot at the big time?
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: (chuckles)
</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey (2)</b>: With those looks, I guarantee you're golden.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: (chuckles)
</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey (2)</b>: So whaddaya say? Ready to be queen of the undercity?
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Hey! What am I? Chopped liver!?
</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey (2)</b>: The kid doesn't need to hear this.
</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey (1)</b>: Now be a good girl and cover your ears, okay?
</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey (2)</b>: You'd be living and working in the most luxurious residence in all of Wall Ma—
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: You want me to be one of Corneo's brides, is that it? Which makes you a "person of influence," right?
</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey (2)</b>: Oh, I see you know your stuff. But I'd say I'm more of a "helping hand." So, why don't you help me help you?
</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey (3)</b>: Let's get going.
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: What're you doing!? Get your hands off me? Ugh!
</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey (3)</b>: Now, don't go playin' ha—
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: (laughs) Know any kids who can do <i>that</i>? No you don't, 'cause <i>I'm</i> an adult.
</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey (2)</b>: (laughs)
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Also, I'm pretty hot stuff myself, thank you very much.
</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey (2)</b>: Hah. Sure, whatever helps you sleep at night, <i>little girl</i>. But if you wanna pull up a seat at the grown-ups' table...be my guest.

</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey (2)</b>: You're gonna eat those words, you smuh piece of shit.
</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey (4)</b>: Boss! Boss! You're not gonna believe this! The hottie of the century just fell righ t into our laps!
</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey (2)</b>: She did?
</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey (4)</b>: (laughs) Goods under the hood, junk in the trunk, and down for a bumpy ride!
</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey (2)</b>: Sorry, ladies, but after careful consideration, we've decided to go with a more "qualified" applicant. Let's go.
</p><p><b>Corneo Lackey (3)</b>: See ya around!
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Okay...
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: So, who were those creeps anyway?
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: Don Corneo's "talent scouts." They'll say and do just about anything to get unsuspecting girls back to the don's mansion.
</p><p><b>Sonon</b>: I thought it looked seedy. Guess you'd <i>have</i> to be a scumbug to build a place like that.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Oho? And how do <i>you</i> know what it looks like?
</p><p><b>Sonon</b>: I saw it while I was scouting the area.
</p><p>(Upon entering the warehouse.)<br />
<b>Nayo</b>: Well, we're here. Now we just have to wait.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Wait for who?
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: Not sure. We used to have someone who could make fake IDs in-house, but...they went off with the splinter cell. We've never dealt with this particular vendor before.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Hey, uh... What's up with that guy?
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: Mako poisoning. That's what happens if you don't make the grade as a SOLDIER...or when the military's done using you.
</p><p><b>Sonon</b>: Just another one of Shinra's victims.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Them again!? Oh, Shinra's so gonna get it!
</p><p><b>Counterfeiter</b>: If it's Shinra you've got beef with... You'll be needing these. Can't access the plate without 'em. They're gonna scan for those things on the train, so make sure to keep 'em on you.
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: Thank you.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Hey, hold up!
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Try it. You'll love it.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Foreigners and their weak jaws...
</p><p><b>Nayo</b>: We should probably head back and wait for Zhijie.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Enjoy your materia while you still can, Shinra, 'cause we're comin'!
</p><p><b>Sonon</b>: Not yet, Boss. With things the way they are, we can't just go strolling up to the front gates. We're gonna need Avalanche to help us bypass security before we can do anything.
</p><p><b>Yuffie</b>: Aw! Hmph.
