# Final Fantasy IV

## Source

The script here is for the DS version from 2007. This script is incomplete - there is a variety of NPC dialogue missing, including some sidequests as well as the barks of background NPCs. 

Some examples: the character 'Livingway' (whose name changes throughout is missing); shopkeeper dialogue is missing; the conversation with the Lady Chancellor of Troi and the shieldmaidens are missing, as well as a lot of the Epopt dialogue (who are also female). That also means some of the dialogue that comments on gender directly is absent. E.g. One of the shieldmaidens in Troi says "We are better ruled by women, who know grace and civility, than by men with their barbarous ways and love of war." 

Another conversation (where Rosa and Rydia reunite with the rest of the party towards the end of the game) includes the line "No use arguing with a woman". A Let's Play youtuber noted that it's interesting 'Corio' has a name (since he's such an insignificant NPC) but Yang's wife doesn't (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao9_A3cjSSM&list=PLVM1qRtVEeEpJzCAfe3Lch3BR6KopIB8N&index=36 47:30) 

## Gender coding

Calcabrina is a combined form of Calca (male doll) and Brina (female doll) - the two dolls merge into one. However, in the DS version, the unformed dolls all look masculine (they have the same avatar). The merged form grows pigtails. I've opted for neutral coding.  

Golbez is the adult form of Theodore/Theodor. I've thus added them as an alias. For clarity I have renamed the character Theodor/Golbez.

'Soldier' denotes different NPCs, but collectively referred to as 'men' in-game, and I think the same character model is used. Likewise for sailor. 

I've coded Sylph as female based on appearance. 

There are eight epopts, all female, and all identical. Coded as a single female character as there are only two lines in the script (although they say a lot more in game - see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtpSR39SZ6w&list=PLVM1qRtVEeEpJzCAfe3Lch3BR6KopIB8N&index=13 from approx 30mins)

I've coded the Guards from Baron as male based on some of the info in the wiki (and it's clearer in the 2D version). 

There are two nurses in the scene with Edward, but it's not clear which is speaking, and they're both female. These character models are used as nurses elsewhere in the game as well. 

'Damcyan Child' could refer to any of three children; they come in together and it isn't clear which is speaking. There appears to be two male children and one female child. Given the ambiguity I'm coding neutral. 

"Innkeeper" refers to more than one character, but best I can tell they're male. 


Zeromus is "the spirit and hatred of the rogue Lunarian Zemus, reborn after his death, the personification of malice itself." It is coded as male in the wiki:

"Mysterious Voice" describes Cecil as his son, which would make him "Kluya", but the description is of Cecil in his dark knight form. Cecil is supposed to look like his father?
