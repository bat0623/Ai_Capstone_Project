However against Golbez's dark army of fiends, monsters and undead the power of Darkness is a very poor match up (since they themselves are empowered by it) and Cecil quickly finds himself hitting a wall in Fabul where his fight against Golbez's forces goes terribly. It's only after he gives up the Dark Knight path and becomes a Paladin that Cecil is truely able to start making headway against the enemy.

The King of Baron strips Cecil of his station at the beginning of the game for questioning orders and [showing concern for the people of Mysidia that he recently besieged](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunishedForSympathy), and it is unclear if Cecil ever regains his position following his coronation.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass

Although you can use him during his BSOD, his stats are absolutely pathetic and he's a blubbering, incoherent mess. It's not until he sees his dark side [either kill his brother Golbez or about to kill Ceodore](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelativeButton) [that he snaps](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather) [out of it](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf) and [returns to being the ass-kicker we all know](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack) .",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD

Both the King of Fabul and Elder of Mysidia tell Cecil he cannot hope to defeat Golbez if he relies upon the power he gained following the path of the Dark Knight, and the latter clearly spells out that, in hunting monsters, Cecil runs risk of becoming one himself should he continue to let his soul be tainted by darkness.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters

../data/FinalFantasy/FFIV_DS/,Final Fantasy IV,Cecil,Cecil Harvey,Lawful Stupid,1," [Lawful Stupid](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid): Subverting this trope is actually a plot point for him, as he worries that [he's becoming a tool of Baron without any morality in the beginning of the game](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeLawfulOrGood).

In fact, he's better off fighting the undead with his bare hands since dark swords only hit for 1 damage point.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad

However this mostly will be overlooked because swords are his best weapons in almost all situations. This does come in handy in the Lodestone Cave/Magnetic Cavern however, as the magnetic field will make it so using a sword will paralyze him.

Nobody else can equip it, but you can get extra cash by removing it and selling it when you get back to a town.

-   Rydia's a bit famous for running into this *often*; her exact eye color and the details of her outfit vary between different games, artists and graphical styles. Since the DS release her appearance has mostly stuck, but eye color still shifts around, usually between green and blue, with the occasional dip into grey.
-   The most notable and oft-remarked-on divergence, though, stands between Kazuko Shibuya's sprites of Rydia as a child and most other depictions (including Yoshitaka Amano's own concept art of her). Across both the original battle sprites (in the SNES and GBA versions) and the *Pixel Remaster*, Shibuya consistently depicts child Rydia as wearing a knee-length blue *dress*, trimmed with golden yellow, with a matching yellow cape-slash-cloak, a pair of sandals with purple-pink lacing (which matches her armbands and hair decoration, thanks to palette limitations) and a somewhat messy bobbed haircut that ends right about at the nape of her neck. The *Pixel Remaster* even takes pains to ensure that the new Rydia field sprite matches the battle sprite precisely, which the origial SNES one could not for complex technical reasons. The DS version of Rydia (and the PSP sprites and other various derivative pieces based off that), meanwhile, depicts child Rydia with much longer hair (going past her shoulders), a yellow *sash*, similar to a sarong, around her waist, fully foot-enclosing slippers, a short green capelet... and a blue-and-green *leotard* for the outfit's centerpiece.

This, in tandem with Taunt to draw enemy attacks, makes him an excellent meat shield and [Black Mage](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMage). As well, many monsters on the moon are plain immune to lower-level magic, and Palom and Rydia won't learn those ""-aga"" spells until Level 41, making Golbez pretty much the *only* offensive spellcaster you have until you level them up another ten-fifteen levels.

In the Super NES release, his boss sprite had dark blue armor with a blue cape, but his player character sprite had bright blue armor with a red cape. In his DS render seen above, he has black armor and a blue cape, but his in-game model has black armor with a red cape. His *Dissidia* appearance reconciles these discrepancies by making his default outfit (based on his original concept art) dark blue with a blue cape, and his alternate outfit gives him black armor with a red cape. As *Dissidia* codified a lot of characters' designs, unless a spin-off is purposefully evoking the designs of the original game, Golbez tends to go with the blue armor and blue cape as his usual design now, with bits of black creeping in.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist

(SPOILER) In *The After Years*, they use opposing schools of magic, both have abilities that rely on drawing enemy attacks from allies, and Golbez's unique sword, Ebony Blade, draws a parallel to Cecil's Holy swords.
