The DS version[pays tribute](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag) to this by color-coding the party members in the opposite order from the Famicom lineup while *[Dissidia Final Fantasy NT](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasyNT)* would give Onion Knight palettes based on three of the four Onion Knights.

The 3D version both [lampshades](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging) and somewhat justifies it by revealing that  (SPOILER)  the warriors are not native to the Floating Continent and came from the surface world .,/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyAnOrphan

Material pertaining to *III* directly will use the 3D version's protagonists while crossovers such as *Dissidia* or *Theatrhythm* will use Onion Knight. It gets particularly odd in mobages such as *Brave Exivus* or *Record Keeper* where you can use both the 3D version's protagonists *and* Onion Knight, though *Record Keeper* does acknowledge it in [special dialogue](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg) and Onion Knights' soul breaks. Meanwhile, the manga uses its own set of characters, although that's justified given how early it was made.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter

The manga diverged them into three boys and one girl, each with distinct appearances and quirks while dropping the Onion Knight motif. The DS version followed suit with its protagonists who were differentiated even further with wardrobes that carried over into the design of their job outfits and having two of the four orphans not end up in Topapa's care. Meanwhile, the Onion Knight seen in *Dissidia*, whilst still based on the original Famicom heroes, is a character in his own right and has his own identity beyond any of the other protagonists.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivergentCharacterEvolution

-   The fourth Onion Knight: His armor is the same shade of red as the first, yellow
-   The manga protagonists tend to have different color schemes across the few colored illustrations they get (such as Muuchi's hair being brown in some illustrations and black in others). Doug is probably the most extreme example, usually being blond and having an association with green and yellow except in at least one case where his hair is silver and his clothes are blue and yellow.
-   Subverted with Luneth: [Onion Knight's](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy) *Luneth* costume associates him with the color blue rather than the usual purple, likely to make him a [Composite Character](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter) with the unnamed warrior from the artwork of the original version of III <sup>note </sup>  When Onion Knight got a proper version of a costume based on said artwork character in *Duodecim*, it used a black outfit variant based on a certain art piece .

Unused text further complicates it by showing that Luneth and Ingus vaguely remember the airship crash and his hometown respectively, along with the mountain range near the Cave of Shadows, while Arc and Refia show no sign of remembering anything prior to their lives on the floating continent.

../data/FinalFantasy/FFIII/,Final Fantasy III,In General,In General,Weapon Specialization,0," [Weapon Specialization](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponSpecialization):<ul>
-   The manga heroes have specific weapons they favor in combat: Muchi uses [a sword](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesPreferSwords), Doug has [a bendable stick with a spikeball on the end](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFlail), Melfi has a bow and arrows as well being proficient in [white magic](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage), and J Bowie sometimes wields a staff while other times relying on [physical prowess](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs). In either case, he also uses [black magic](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMage).
-   The remake heroes don't have specific weapons, so much as specific jobs that they are usually portrayed as in supplementary material such as the opening (with [certain exceptions](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyRecordKeeper)): Luneth is a [Warrior](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker), Arc is a [Black Mage](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMage), Refia is a [White Mage](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage) and Ingus is a [Red Mage](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedMage). Of course, during gameplay, you can make them any class you'd like.

The original game didn't give the Onion Knights names and most media at the time didn't use consistent names. The manga adaptation, *Yūkyū no Kaze Densetsu: Final Fantasy III Yori* uses the names Muuchi, Doug, Melfi and J.Bowie, but the manga also toes a line between [Pragmatic Adaptation](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation) and [In Name Only](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly) and those names are not used outside of it. After the release of the DS version, screenshots and gameplay of the Famicom version in media such as the Ultimania or *Theatrhythm*'s EMS sequence use the same names as the DS protagonists (Luneth, Arc, Refia and Ingus). However, in *Dissidia Final Fantasy*, the Onion Knight in that game who is based more closely on the Famicom heroes [simply goes by Onion Knight or variations of the name](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep). Worth mentioning is that this specific Onion Knight's Japanese name is written in Katakana (オニオンナイト).",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonName

-   *[Dissidia Final Fantasy](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DissidiaFinalFantasy)* would represent the original Onion Knights via a single Onion Knight who appears as the *FFIII* hero representative, a trend that would continue with later crossover games. Leans into [ZigZag territory](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope) as, although his descriptions occasionally mention his other three friends [we have yet to see them](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost).
-   In a less straightforward example, Luneth's personality seems to be the closest to the original Onion Knights.
-   Goes in the opposite direction in *Final Fantasy Record Keeper* where, despite the sprite being based on the class' appearances prior to Dissidia, Onion Knight's soul breaks and easter egg dialogue make it clear he's based on the Dissidia interpretation. The release of the III-themed [Dreambreaker](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard) dungeon in 2020 *finally* adds a dress record based on the Dissidia interpretation named ""Cosmic Onion Knight"".</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter
