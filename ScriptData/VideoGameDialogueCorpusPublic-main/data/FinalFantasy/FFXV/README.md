# Final Fantasy XV

## Source

Some optional/incidental dialogue not included in the source.

## Gender Coding

Added "Noctis" as main character. Changed "Noct" in the groupings to "Noctis" (as that's how he's usually known); amended the aliases accordingly. 

Changed the gender coding of the summons ("Astrals") to match their usual/wiki reading (formerly they were coded as 'neutral'). 

I've added "Man" and "Woman" to the gendered categories, because although they pertain to multiple different NPCs, it's important that "Man" has more than double the lines that "Woman" does. I've also coded "Boyfriend", "Girlfriend", "Boy", "Girl", "Old Man" and "Old Woman".

"Hunter" sometimes refers to Gladiolus - I've split out the lines under the alias as with Kingdom Hearts. I couldn't find the character in-game for lines 1746-1748 so have left those out." I've added the aliases for "???". Announcement" is the classic 'female robot voice' (from the Security Levels part of the game) so I've coded accordingly. 

"Altissian Guard" is visible/audible at 17:36 here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-2JOzjKSR8. I've coded male accordingly. The other line is available https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEihdgECmm8 at 5:06 and again is a male voice. 

One of the "Proprietor" characters is visible/audible at the beginning of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M96ss_QmKoc); I've coded "male" accordingly. The other is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loTLkQLda20) around 0:20 and again I've coded male. Both are just called 'Proprietor' in the script, but for easier identification I've added alises. "Gatekeeper" is visible/audible [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-2JOzjKSR8) at 19:05 (coded male). "Receptionist" appears [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xHtHMv4bgg) at approx 0:10 (coded male). "Server" appears [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsHXZTYb8_k) at 2:58 (coded male). "Estate Guard" [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZxGjscfir4) at 0:10 (coded male). I think the "Vendor" is the one from the Coernix Station garage, although I can't find that particular scene - he appears in other parts of the game with a male avatar/voice (I've coded male; he only has one line). "Staff" appears [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5c3VFpPB20) at 7:08 (coded male). 

Added alias for "Suspicious Stranger".
