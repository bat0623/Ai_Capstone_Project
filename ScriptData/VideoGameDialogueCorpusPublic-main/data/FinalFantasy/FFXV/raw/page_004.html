<h3>Episode Gladiolus</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>FINAL FANTASY XV</strong></span><br />
After suffering a humbling defeat at the hands of Ravus, Gladiolus embarks on a journey of self-discovery. His destination: the Tempering Grounds, where he seeks to undertake a trial of body and mind that has heretofore afforded but a sole survivor.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Shortly after Gladiolus reunites with the others in Chapter 8, the Chocobros sit around a campfire; Gladiolus and Ignis are each drinking a cup of coffee; Noct and Prompto are on their cellphones]<br />
Gladiolus: I&#8217;m stuffed.</p>
<p>[Gladio raises his cup in Ignis&#8217;s direction]<br />
Gladio: My compliments to the chef.<br />
Ignis: My pleasure. Did you enjoy your time with the marshal?</p>
<p>[Gladio nods]<br />
Prompto: So, uh, what&#8217;s that thing on your face?</p>
<p>[Gladio points to his new scar]<br />
Gladio: This?<br />
Noctis: Yeah—X marks the spot.<br />
Gladio: Just a scratch. The other guy got off a lot worse.<br />
Noctis: Worse than looking like some kind of thug?<br />
Ignis: Speaking of which, who was this &#8220;other guy&#8221;?<br />
Gladio: They call him&#8230; &#8230;&#8221;The Blademaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>[The screen fades to black as Gladio begins his flashback account of where he was and what he was doing during Chapter 7 of the main game]</p>
<p>[A prompt appears asking &#8220;Begin the combat tutorial?&#8221;; the player can select either &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No&#8221;]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Gladio sits in a field near the Talepar Rest Area with his legs crossed after taking out a voretooth pack; his cell phone begins to ring; he answers]<br />
Cor: Gladio?<br />
Gladiolus: Yeah—who do you think it is?<br />
Cor: Catch you at a bad time?<br />
Gladiolus: Are you here yet?<br />
Cor: Yeah, I&#8217;m at the Crow&#8217;s Nest.<br />
Gladiolus: Good. Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.<br />
Cor: Sure.<br />
Gladiolus: So&#8230; Are you ready to move out?<br />
Cor: What about you? Are you mentally prepared?</p>
<p>[Gladio is silent a moment]<br />
Gladiolus: Of course. I&#8217;ll be right over.</p>
<p>[The scene transitions to inside the Crow&#8217;s Nest; Cor is sitting at the bar with a cup of coffee]<br />
Cor: &#8216;Bout time.</p>
<p>[Gladio takes a seat beside him; the restaurant server approaches]<br />
Server: What&#8217;ll it be?<br />
Gladiolus: Just a water&#8217;s fine. Thanks.</p>
<p>[The server walks away; as Cor and Gladio begin to talk, Cor just looks straight ahead]<br />
Cor: Allow me to ask you once more: are you sure you&#8217;re ready to take on the Blademaster?<br />
Gladiolus: I went up against the high commander and got my ass handed to me. I didn&#8217;t stand a chance. And I never will unless I get more power.<br />
Cor: Then answer my question: are you ready or not?<br />
Gladiolus: You think I would&#8217;ve called you here if I weren&#8217;t?</p>
<p>[Cor now turns his head and looks Gladio directly in the eyes]<br />
Cor: So you&#8217;re ready to face death?</p>
<p>[Both men are silent for a moment]<br />
Cor: Gilgamesh awaits challengers in the deepest recesses of those ruins. It&#8217;s been thirty years since we uncovered the caves. We&#8217;ve sent countless expeditions, but all of our efforts have afforded us no rewards&#8230; &#8230;and no survivors.<br />
Gladiolus: Except for you. You undertook the trial, and you made it back alive.</p>
<p>[Cor says nothing for a long moment; finally, he casts his eyes down as he speaks]<br />
Cor: Barely.</p>
<p>[Cor gets up from his seat]<br />
Cor: Let&#8217;s move.</p>
<p>[The scene transitions to Cor and Gladio standing along the path leading into the Tempering Grounds]<br />
Cor: Did you tell your friends why you were taking off?<br />
Gladiolus: Just said it was &#8220;business.&#8221; Didn&#8217;t want &#8217;em getting all worried about me.<br />
Cor: Or knowing your pride took a beating.</p>
<p>[Gladio and Cor proceed into the Tempering Grounds; almost immediately, they&#8217;re greeted by the sight of corpses of long-dead warriors littering the gorge; and almost immediately after that, they witness smoke-like azure-colored energy float down into the corpses, followed by the cadavers rising to their feet]<br />
Gladiolus: They&#8217;re alive!?<br />
Cor: Not for long!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as Gladio and Cor battle the dead warriors)<br />
[One of the spirits here in the ruins projects its voice to Gladio]<br />
Soul: Have you come to prove your might?<br />
Gladiolus: Who are you?<br />
Soul: One of many who haunt these grounds, following our leader in death as in life. Naught but our souls remain, clinging to the vestiges of our past.<br />
Gladiolus: Why?<br />
Soul: To test those determined to become the King&#8217;s Shield, and prepare them to inherit the power they pursue.<br />
Cor: The Blademaster&#8217;s men have sworn their loyalty both before and beyond the grave, scaring off the unworthy.<br />
Gladiolus: Then they&#8217;d better prepare for disappointment. I don&#8217;t scare easy.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[As Gladio and Cor proceed into the crevasse, they soon come to a cavern entrance requiring they crouch to gain entry; a short distance within, they come to a rapidly running brook running down a slope]<br />
Gladiolus: Only way to go is down&#8230;</p>
<p>[Gladio gets into the water and lets it carry him down into the depths of the cavern, landing in an area filled with water slightly higher than ankle-deep; suddenly, an enormous snake called a brunnrsomr emerges from the water and begins to attack]<br />
Gladiolus: He ain&#8217;t going down without a fight.</p>
<p>(after Gladio and Cor kill the brunnrsomr)<br />
[The cavern begins to take on an eerie green hue; Gladio looks around to find himself alone, Cor nowhere in sight; suddenly, a tall, hooded humanoid figure materializes from azure smoke; the figure holds a katana in its right hand; its left arm is missing]<br />
Giglamesh: You come to prove yourself worthy of my mantle?<br />
Gladiolus: I do. I am here to undertake the Trial of Gilgamesh.<br />
Gilgamesh: And what is it you hope to glean?</p>
<p>[Gladio raises his hand and clenches it into a fist]<br />
Gladiolus: Power—and you&#8217;re gonna give it to me.</p>
<p>[Gilgamesh dispells his katana]<br />
Gilgamesh: Is that so?</p>
<p>[Gilgamesh replaces the katana with a large broadsword, then quickly charges at Gladiolus]<br />
Gladiolus: Ready or not!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the battle ends)<br />
[Gladio finds his sword locked with Gilgamesh&#8217;s in a recreation of the position he was in when he fought Ravus]<br />
Gilgamesh: Brute force alone does little to impress. Only he who possesses both muscle and mettle of equal caliber deserves the honor of fighting beside the Chosen King as his sworn Shield.</p>
<p>[Gladio briefly flashes back to his confrontation with Ravus]<br />
Gladiolus: You saying I don&#8217;t?</p>
<p>[Gilgamesh breaks their sword lock, knocking Gladiolus to the ground]<br />
Gilgamesh: A great evil threatens the people of your world. It is but the King of Kings and his Shield who can safeguard their lives. All those unworthy or unwilling to rise to the task meet their end here, by my blade.<br />
Gladiolus: I ain&#8217;t meeting mine any time soon. This &#8220;trial&#8221; hasn&#8217;t even begun.<br />
Gilgamesh: If you do not fear death, then go forth with reckless abandon and prove your worth.</p>
<p>[Gilgamesh turns and vanishes in more azure smoke; the lighting of the cave returns to normal; after a silent moment alone, Gladio speaks aloud to himself]<br />
Gladiolus: You are ready for this.</p>
<p>[Cor suddenly returns at that moment]<br />
Cor: In that case, let the trials begin.<br />
Gladiolus: So, the Blademaster&#8230;<br />
Cor: He&#8217;s a master of blades. What—were you expecting something profound?</p>
<p>[The two continue on, scaling a small ledge and ascending a stone stairway that begins to lead them up out of the cavern; before long, they come to a campsite]<br />
Gladiolus: Better rest here while I can.<br />

(while resting by the fire at the campsite)<br />
Cor: The Blademaster isn&#8217;t here to train you; he&#8217;s here to test you. He won&#8217;t go easy on you just because you joined the Crownsguard.<br />
Gladiolus: So, no mercy for newbies like me.</p>
<p>[A prompt appears to select either &#8220;Tell me more&#8221; or &#8220;That&#8217;s enough&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Tell me more<br />
Gladiolus: So what—the weak aren&#8217;t worthy of serving as Shield?<br />
Cor: In his eyes, the weak aren&#8217;t worthy of living. All of them are fools, punished for aspiring beyond their station. I was a fool back then, too—and I was punished.<br />
Gladiolus: But you weren&#8217;t killed. Maybe you weren&#8217;t worthy of serving as Shield, but he must&#8217;ve seen you as worthy of living.<br />
Cor: Maybe he did, maybe he didn&#8217;t.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
That&#8217;s enough<br />
Gladiolus: No point in overthinking it.<br />
Cor: But don&#8217;t forget it.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;</p>

<p>(as the two leave camp behind)<br />
Cor: Keep your eyes and ears open.<br />
Gladiolus: Done and done.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as they continue making their way through the cavern)<br />
[The spirit from before continues projecting its voice to Gladio]<br />
Soul: Your skill is impressive. You may have the strength to defeat the darkness&#8230; &#8230;but do you have the spirit to survive these trials?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as Gladio and Cor run into yet another battle)<br />
Gladiolus: Not good—they keep on coming!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as this battle progresses)<br />
Cor: Just like I taught you. Ready?<br />
Gladiolus: And raring to go!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as they progress a short way past the previous battle)<br />
[Gladio and Cor come to a wall made of rock formations curved inward on one another; it is also seemingly sealed by a magical talisman consisting of a sword stuck in the ground with several ropes tied to it; the sword&#8217;s blade glows with blue energy]<br />
Gladiolus: What&#8217;s this?<br />
Cor: A trial chamber. The hand-holding stops here—good luck.</p>
<p>[Gladio grabs the grip of the sword, and the ropes vanish in a flash of light; he pulls the blade from the ground and the entire weapon then vanishes in a burst of light; the rock wall crumbles away, revealing a small cave; Gladiolus enters and is confronted by a host of skeletons and a wraith-like entity called a nergal as the cave wall behind him becomes sealed once again]<br />
Soul: Prepare yourself, Young Warrior, for the trial that awaits. Prove your might, and our power shall be yours.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after Gladio defeats the nergal)<br />
[He approaches a small shrine made from rocks within the chamber; inside burns a blue flame; Gladio places his hand on the flame and endures the subsequent winds and energy that buffet him from within the shrine; he then pulls his hand out of the shrine; his hand now briefly burns with the blue flame]<br />
Soul: Our power goes with you now, Young Warrior.</p>
<p>[The rocks the shrine is made from turn to light and vanish as the wall behind the shrine splits and slides open to allow Gladio further passage]</p>
<p>Gladiolus has completed the first of the souls&#8217; trials.<br />
He can now perform blocks capable of withstanding the mightiest of blows—even those dealt by the Blademaster himself.</p>
<p>Soul: Stand tall, for the Shield of the King must kneel in subjugation before no man.</p>
<p>[Cor rejoins Gladio at this point]<br />
Gladiolus: Thanks for the advice—and for the pick-me-up.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as Gladio and Cor proceed through the next passageway)<br />
Cor: Well, you made it out alive. Your first trial may have ended, but many more await you on your road to an audience with the Blademaster. Prepare yourself.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Gladio and Cor soon emerge from the cavern onto a ledge along the cliffside within the Talepar Crag; there&#8217;s a campsite here]</p>

Gladiolus: My father never undertook the Trial of Gilgamesh, did he?<br />
Cor: No. You wanna know why?</p>
<p>[A prompt appears to select either &#8220;Yeah&#8221; or &#8220;Not really&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Yeah<br />
Gladiolus: I do. I mean, it can&#8217;t be because he was scared, right?<br />
Cor: Not of the Trial. He was scared of failing as leader of the Crownsguard—and as Shield of the King. He couldn&#8217;t leave His Majesty alone, weakened by the Wall as he was. After all, what good is a Shield with no one to protect? What about you? Worried about leaving Your Majesty alone?<br />
Gladiolus: A little, but I&#8217;m gonna do what&#8217;s right for me like my father did what was right for him.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Not really<br />
Gladiolus: He never pried into my business, so I won&#8217;t dig into his.<br />

<p>[From the ledge with the campsite, the path ahead is a ramp running up the face of the cliffside; the ramp appears to be made of wood that has long-since rotted, but it holds; it also leads to two other such ramps, which allow the two warriors to gradually ascend along the cliffside]</p>
<p>(as they proceed up the ramps)<br />
Gladiolus: How long has it been since you undertook the Trial? Thirty years or so?<br />
Cor: Give or take. I was a lot younger than you are—and far less experienced. It&#8217;s a wonder I even made it out alive.<br />
Gladiolus: This place look familiar to you?<br />
Cor: Vaguely. The younger me had little mind for taking in the sights.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Before long, Gladio and Cor reach additional wooden pathways, which they follow to an actual stone path along the cliffside; from there, they reach the entrance to another cavern within the cliff wall; after disposing of the creatures that attack them by the entrance, they proceed into the cavern]</p>
<p>(a short distance into the cave)<br />
[Gladio and Cor come across a talisman and wall similar to the one from earlier]<br />
Gladiolus: Another trial chamber.<br />
Cor: And another chance for the warriors to impart their wisdom. It won&#8217;t come easy, though—you&#8217;ll have to earn it.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Gladio proceeds to the new trial chamber in the same manner as the first, only this one is actually a stone bridge spanning the divide of the Taelpar Crag; as Gladio walks out onto the stone bridge, he looks up to find himself being targeted by a fiery winged creature called an enkidu]</p>
<p>(as Gladio&#8217;s battle with the enkidu begins)<br />
Soul (1): How many moons has it been?<br />
Soul (2): Since our last visitor? Far more than I can count.<br />
Soul (1): Let us see how our latest challenger will fare.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(once Gladio defeats the enkidu, he proceeds across the bridge and climbs through a fissure in the cliff wall to enter a stone chamber housing the next power shrine; akin in design to the first, Gladio proceeds in like manner]</p>
<p>(after acquiring the power within the second shrine)<br />
Soul: Venture forth, Young Warrior, bearing our hopes and dreams.</p>
<p>[This shrine vanishes in the same fashion as the first, and the wall beyond it likewise splits and slides open as before]</p>
<p>Gladiolus has completed the second of the souls&#8217; trials.<br />
He can now perform the Maelstrom Glaive Art when his valor is high.</p>
<p>Soul: Look ahead, for the Shield of the King must safeguard our future.<br />
Gladiolus: Leave it to me.</p>
<p>[He&#8217;s now rejoined by Cor]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the two proceed on ahead and battle more spirits dwelling here)<br />
Soul: The skills shared by these souls have been passed down for generations. The Shield of the King would do well to put them to good use.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while clearing another room of enemies)<br />
Gladiolus: Gotta say, this place ain&#8217;t like anywhere else in Lucis.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[After defeating all the enemies in this room, an exit back to the cliffside is revealed as part of the wall splits and slides open]</p>
<p>(as Gladio and Cor step out onto a ledge within the gorge)<br />
Soul: Thousands set foot on these grounds, all of them fools unprepared for the dangers lurking within. They all meet with the same fate—as will you.<br />
Gladiolus: I don&#8217;t think so.<br />
Soul: Think what you may, but I know otherwise. The Lucis you call home is nothing like the Lucis I once served. Your age has forgotten the horrors of war, coddled by the king and drunk off the complacency of peace. No Shield worthy of defending the True King could be born from such depravity.<br />
Gladiolus: Thanks for the vote of confidence.<br />
Cor: Look at the bright side: everyone loves an underdog.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Gladio and Cor proceed across another wooden path, then down another series of wooden ramps, eventually coming to a second stone bridge spanning the chasm; several large creatures are on the bridge]</p>
<p>Gladiolus: Aww. A warm welcome, just for me.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as Gladio and Cor make their way up the stone staircase on the other side of the bridge, then climb to a ledge above)<br />
Soul: Will you stand tall, even when your flesh fails you, or will you fall to your knees?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[After reaching a higher ledge, battling some more large creatures, and then ascending more wooden ramps, Gladio and Cor find another campsite on a ledge]</p>
<p>Gladiolus: Time to take a load off.<br />

(while resting by the fire at the campsite)<br />
Cor: Never thought I&#8217;d make my way back to the Tempering Grounds.<br />
Gladiolus: You said it&#8217;s been thirty years. Were you as &#8220;immortal&#8221; then as you are now?<br />
Cor: If you wanna know, I&#8217;ll talk.</p>
<p>[A prompt appears to select either &#8220;Yeah&#8221; or &#8220;Not really&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Yeah<br />
Gladiolus: The Blademaster—what was he like?<br />
Cor: I don&#8217;t remember much&#8230;except for those eyes. They pierced my heart and peered right into my soul. It was like he knew my every move even before I did. Try as you may, there&#8217;s no fooling those eyes.<br />
Gladiolus: We&#8217;ll see about that.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Not really<br />
Gladiolus: Nah, I&#8217;m fine not knowing.<br />
Cor: Some stories are better left untold.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<div class="spdiv">[collapse]</div>

</div>

<p>[From the campsite, Gladio and Cor enter another cavern passageway within the cliff face]</p>
<p>(as they continue on)<br />
Soul: He who protects the king&#8230; &#8230;must boast muscle and mettle, both finely tempered. Should he lack either, the Shield will shatter.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Shortly thereafter, the two warriors come to a wall upon which a demonwall-like entity manifests; this being is called an inannaduru, and is accompanied by soul of fortitude enemies]</p>
<p>(after defeating the inannaduru)<br />
[The creature discorporates and the wall it had been bonded to shatters]<br />
Cor: The penultimate trial awaits. Prove to them you&#8217;re prepared to serve as the Shield of the Chosen King.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Soon thereafter, Gladio and Cor find the next trial chamber, one much like the first]</p>
<p>(as Gladio unseals the trial chamber)<br />
Soul: Be true, for the Shield of the King must deceive none—not even himself.<br />
Gladiolus: Yeah, easier said than done.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Gladio enters the trial chamber, emerging into a short cavern passageway; after making his way down a couple of stone stairways, he finds himself in a room with another shrine; suddenly, a large creature resembling the red giant daemons begins to manifest; called a humbaba, it also manifests in the same manner as those daemons]<br />
Soul: The Shield is bold, shrinking before none. Waste not the arsenal at your behest.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[When Gladio defeats the humbaba, it discorporates like a red giant daemon as well; Gladiolus then claims the power in the nearby shrine as he has during previous trials]<br />
Soul: Now, naught but the final trial awaits you.</p>
<p>[As has been the case after claiming the power at previous shrines, the wall behind this one likewise splits and slides open]</p>
<p>Gladiolus has completed the third of the souls&#8217; trials.<br />
An aura envelops his blade, allowing him to deal damage to Gilgamesh.</p>
<p>[Gladio is rejoined by Cor]<br />
Cor: Nice work. Maybe you&#8217;ve got what it takes after all.<br />
Gladiolus: Maybe, but it ain&#8217;t for you or me to decide.<br />
Cor: True—and the Blademaster is a more formidable foe than any you&#8217;ve faced thus far.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Venturing through the new opening, Gladio and Cor find another campsite]</p>

(while resting by the fire at the campsite)<br />
Gladiolus: Well, what about you? I wanna know what was going through your head back then.<br />
Cor: You that interested in me?</p>
<p>[A prompt appears to select either &#8220;Yeah&#8221; or &#8220;Not really&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Yeah<br />
Gladiolus: I mean, you were a lot younger than I am.<br />
Cor: And a lot brasher too, if you can believe it. Wouldn&#8217;t listen to a single word anyone said. I thought I was invincible. No one could stop me&#8230;until he cut me down to size. I was cast out in defeat, my hubris laid bare for all to see. &#8220;You really are immortal,&#8221; they said—and it stuck.<br />
Gladiolus: That&#8217;s rough&#8230; Still, you made it back alive—something no one else has ever done—and I respect that.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Not really<br />
Gladiolus: Don&#8217;t flatter yourself. Forget I even asked.<br />
Cor: It would be my pleasure.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;</p>

<p>(as Gladio and Cor continue on down another series of wooden ramps)<br />
Soul: Come here to die, have you?<br />
Gladiolus: You looking to die again?<br />
Soul: You amuse but do not impress. You lack his conviction.<br />
Gladiolus: Whose?<br />
Soul: He who traversed these caves some thirty years ago. Turning a deaf ear to our wails and wishes, he proceeded unfazed, eyes ever forward. Yet he proved powerless before the general, cast out in defeat. If even he could not succeed, I see no hope for you.<br />
Cor: That guy must&#8217;ve left quite an impression&#8230; &#8230;when he landed flat on his face.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Making their way down to yet one more ledge, Gladio and Cor soon find themselves at a sealed wall in the cliff face; unlike previous trial chambers, this one is not sealed by a talisman, just rock growth; Cor stands before the wall, and raises his katana, still in its sheath; he unsheathes the blade a foot or so; the rock growth barring Gladio&#8217;s entry dissipates; Cor sheathes his katana once more and lowers the weapon; he speaks to Gladio without turning to look at him]</p>
<p>Cor: Clarus would&#8217;ve tried to stop you, you know—just like he tried to stop me all those years ago.<br />
Gladiolus: How come?<br />
Cor: Because one aspiring to the role of King&#8217;s Shield can stake his life for none but his liege—not even for himself.</p>
<p>[Cor looks at Gladio]<br />
&#8220;Do you dare risk all for naught in return?&#8221; His words stayed with me. And he was right: I barely made it back with nothing to show for it.<br />
Gladiolus: So, you gonna stop me?<br />
Cor: No, I won&#8217;t. But I will warn you one last time of the danger you&#8217;re about to face—just like your father warned me. Once you set foot through that door, there&#8217;s no turning back—and no one to help you if you fall. One false step, and it may prove your last.</p>
<p>[Gladio takes a couple of steps forward]<br />
Gladiolus: I&#8217;ll be fine. Maybe I&#8217;ll come back with a souvenir.</p>
<p>[He smiles at Cor, then proceeds on ahead]</p>
<p>Cor: Just come back alive. Be safe, Gladio.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as Gladio makes his way through the final passage)<br />
Gladiolus: There&#8217;s a chill in the air&#8230; I can feel his presence. He&#8217;d better be ready for me.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[He comes to a final stone bridge spanning the Talepar Crag; embedded in the stone bridge on either side along its full length are a great multitude of swords; Gilgamesh stands at the other end of the bridge, his back turned; Gladio approaches and announces himself]<br />
Gladiolus: I&#8217;m here.</p>
<p>[Gilgamesh slowly turns his head]<br />
Gilgamesh: Brandishing your brute force?<br />
Gladiolus: Yeah. Let&#8217;s see if you can handle it.</p>
<p>[Their battle begins; Gilgamesh wields a broadsword in the hand of his only remaining arm]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the battle continues)<br />
Gilgamesh: You only delay the inevitable, O Unworthy One. Look how you tremble!<br />
Gladiolus: I ain&#8217;t afraid of you.<br />
Gilgamesh: With every passing second, the fear in your heart grows greater still.<br />
Gladiolus: So what do I do? Just roll over and die?<br />
Gilgamesh: Yes. Why else would you have come here, if not to join the other lost souls?<br />
Gladiolus: Because I&#8217;ve got what it takes—and I&#8217;m gonna prove it!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[At a certain point in the battle, Gilgamesh parries Gladio&#8217;s sword, then simply stands and stares]<br />
Gilgamesh: Blind reliance on strength alone reveals your weakness of will.</p>
<p>[As Gilgamesh utters his next line, Gladio turns to look across the many blades found here]<br />
Gilgamesh: Countless disappointments met their end here, and so shall you!<br />
Gladiolus; No. I didn&#8217;t come here to die. I came here to prove to you I&#8217;m worthy!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[At a certain point, Gladio seemingly has Gilgamesh defeated and brings his blade down for a bisecting swing intended to finish him off; Gilgamesh forms a fiery left arm from his energy, however, and catches Gladio&#8217;s blade]</p>
<p>Gilgamesh: You are strong—yet so long as fear binds your heart&#8230; &#8230;the power you possess is wasted on you.</p>
<p>[Gilgamesh dispells the broadsword in his right hand and replaces it with a katana that he begins to wield in both hands]<br />
Gladiolus: I&#8217;ve still got a few tricks up my sleeve, too. Ain&#8217;t no way I&#8217;m backing down now!<br />
[Note: The audio here has Gladiolus say &#8220;I&#8217;ve still got some tricks up my sleeve, too.&#8221;]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[After depleting half of Gilgamesh&#8217;s remaining energy, Gladio will attempt a horizontal slash across Gilgamesh&#8217;s midsection; Gilgamesh blocks the attack, however, and counters with a slash that cuts Gladio across his forehead; this is the origin of the new scar Gladio carries when he returns to Noctis and the others in Chapter 8 of the main game; eventually, Gladio is able to defeat Gilgamesh, delivering a strike that throws Gilgamesh off balance and down onto one knee; his fiery left arm dissipates as he falls]<br />
Gladiolus: I kneel before no man!</p>
<p>[Gladio just stares at Gilgamesh for a moment, then seems to become aware of the pain in his forehead, grunting a couple of times and placing his hand there; he lets out a chuckle]<br />
Gladiolus: Not exactly the &#8220;souvenir&#8221; I had in mind. It took me a while, but I realized something: you&#8217;re right—I am afraid. Afraid of accepting the fact that maybe I&#8217;m not really cut out for the job I&#8217;m expected to do. But hey, at least I&#8217;m not walking away empty-handed. I&#8217;d better get going. I may be all muscle and no mettle, but I&#8217;m gonna keep protecting Noct the only way I know how.</p>
<p>[Gladio turns and starts walking away; Gilgamesh rises back to his feet and addresses him]<br />
Gilgamesh: Spoken like a true Shield of the King.</p>
<p>[Gladio stops and turns back to face the undead warrior]<br />
Gilgamesh: Fear and doubt beget death alone. He who averts his gaze from his own faults cannot himself a true Shield call, but you—having made peace with your inner self—have proven you are worthy. The Chosen King should be so fortunate as to have a man like yourself serving at his side.<br />
Gladiolus: You mean&#8230;?</p>
<p>[Gilgamesh looks at his katana, then holds its grip out to Gladio]<br />
Gilgamesh: And with this glaive, I entrust my power to you.</p>
<p>[Gladio stabs his own sword into the ground, then approaches Gilgamesh to receive his gift, the Genji Blade; as he takes the weapon into his hands, Gladio notices a medallion bearing the Crownsguard symbol hanging from the katana]<br />
Gladiolus: Where did you&#8230;?<br />
Gilgamesh: Taken from the young man who impressed me with his strength of will. It was with this very blade he stole from me my arm.<br />
Gladiolus: But&#8230;I can&#8217;t accept this.<br />
Gilgamesh: If he still walks among the living, a man of his mettle will have doubtless transcended attachment to mere material possessions.<br />
Gladiolus: You&#8217;re probably right. In that case, don&#8217;t mind if I do.<br />
Gilgamesh: Now, hasten forth—with mind unclouded by doubt and will unmoved by fear. The Last King of Lucis is ill fit to fight without his Shield.</p>
<p>[Gladio nods and smiles]<br />
Gladiolus: Thanks again.</p>
<p>[He turns and leaves, carrying the Genji Blade at his side]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as Gladio exits from the final trial chamber)<br />
Cor: You made it.<br />
Gladiolus: Sure did.<br />
Cor: And so quickly. I&#8217;m impressed.</p>
<p>[Gladio raises the Genji Blade, and shows it to Cor]<br />
Gladiolus: Brought this back with me, too. Figured you might get a kick out of it.<br />
Cor: I wondered where I put that thing.</p>
<p>[Cor stares at it for a moment, then realizes Gladio is presenting it to him]<br />
Cor: Keep it. Makes for a better souvenir than that scar.</p>
<p>[Cor turns and begins to walk away; Gladio follows after; the scene transitions to the two walking back down the path they took into the Tempering Grounds]<br />
Gladiolus: Y&#8217;know, he mentioned he lost his arm in battle with a real hot-headed young guy back in the day.<br />
Cor: That so?<br />
Gladiolus: Whoever it was left a lasting impression on him. Talked about how the guy had the strongest will he&#8217;d ever seen.<br />
Cor: Takes more than will to complete the trial. You need to wield your weapon with a primal finesse. If you fail to prove your might, you get cast out empty-handed.<br />
Gladiolus: I dunno. He didn&#8217;t seem to think the guy would let it bother him. Said the guy&#8217;s too old to care about material things anymore—if he&#8217;s still alive.</p>
<p>[The scene transitions to the two walking back out into the wider world]<br />
Cor: Gladio.</p>
<p>[Gladio comes to a stop, then turns back to Cor]<br />
Gladiolus: Huh?<br />
Cor: I hope you feel more confident in light of your success today. Few men can lay claim to such an accomplishment—not even Cor the Immortal.<br />
Gladiolus: Yeah, but I didn&#8217;t earn myself a badass nickname like he did. Still, I&#8217;m glad I went through with it.</p>
<p>[Gladio turns back to the outside world]<br />
Gladiolus: I can finally say I&#8217;m truly ready to fulfill my duty.<br />
Cor: Good.</p>
<p>[Gladio stretches his shoulders]<br />
Gladiolus: Well, I guess this Shield better mosey on back to his King. Wouldn&#8217;t want him to get scared without me.</p>
<p>[Gladio and Cor continue on; the screen fades to black for a long moment, then transitions back to the time of Chapter 8 in the main game, with Gladio finishing up his story]<br />
Prompto: So that&#8217;s how you got it.<br />
Gladio: Whaddaya think?<br />
Prompto: Very perpendicular. Really complements the one you got when you saved Noct from that bully.<br />
Gladio: Yeah. Only difference is, this time, I ended up taking a pretty bad beating, too.<br />
Ignis: Not unlike the licking the marshal received back when he was a lad.<br />
Prompto: Musta had a lotta guts to go up against Gilgamesh back then.<br />
Noctis: Yeah, Dad said he used to be a real firecracker.<br />
Prompto: The more you know&#8230;</p>
<p>[Ignis looks down, as though pondering, and makes a &#8220;Hm&#8221; sound]<br />
Ignis: If the Blademaster sequestered himself during the Founder King&#8217;s reign, then he&#8217;s haunted those halls for some two millenia.<br />
Prompto: That&#8217;s a long time.<br />
Gladio: All those years waiting for the Chosen King to arise. You sure know how to take your sweet old time.<br />
Noctis: What can I say? I&#8217;m worth the wait.<br />
Prompto: Gimme a break.<br />
Ignis: And I, as well.<br />
Gladio: Just because you&#8217;ve got a Shield to protect you now doesn&#8217;t mean you get to slack off.</p>
<p>[Gladio leans back in his chair, then looks at the Genji Blade propped up beside him and smiles]<br />
Gladio: But if you do, I&#8217;ll be ready.</p>

<h3>Episode Prompto</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>FINAL FANTASY XV</strong></span><br />
A schism splits the royal retinue when Noctis inadvertently pushes Prompto from atop a speeding freight liner. Seemingly betrayed by his best friend, Prompto suppresses feelings of sadness and trudges through the snow in search of answers.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[The episode opens on Prompto slowly making his way across a snowfield during a blizzard, his left arm raised to shield him from the wind and snow; since being separated from his friends, he&#8217;s also donned attire more appropriate for this environment, such as a fur-lined jacket and boots, as well as a skull cap; even with these measures at protecting himself from the cold, he grunts with each step, and ice has formed on his hair and face; a caption informs us that this is &#8220;Several days later&#8230;&#8221; following his fall from the train in Chapter 11 of the main game]<br />
Prompto: It&#8217;s freezing out here.</p>
<p>[After taking a few more steps, Prompto begins having great difficulty just remaining on his feet]<br />
Prompto: No&#8230;</p>
<p>[After barely making it any further, Prompto gasps and collapses to his knees; after managing to get back up, he continues shuffling forward, more slowly than before]<br />
Prompto: What a way to go.</p>
<p>[Prompto makes it no more than a couple of steps further before collapsing face first into the snow with a weak grunt; as the elements continue their relentless assault upon him and his vision begins to fade, Prompto looks up to see imperial soldiers jumping down onto the snowfield from drop ships above; the soldiers stand over Prompto, examining him as his body succumbs and his awareness fades to white]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[A vision plays of Prompto as a child walking across the courtyard outside the Citadel with his eyes cast down; Prompto&#8217;s voice can be heard]<br />
Prompto: My whole life, all I ever wanted was friends&#8230;</p>
<p>[The vision of Prompto as a child looks up to see Gladio, Ignis and Noct as adults coming down the steps of the Citadel, then walking past him across the courtyard; they seemingly don&#8217;t even notice him]<br />
Prompto: &#8230;but no one ever wanted me back.</p>
<p>[Prompto watches them go, then hangs his head]<br />
Prompto: So when I finally found people who [I]did[/I] want me, I did everything I could to make them stay.</p>
<p>[Young Prompto starts to run after his friends, but they vanish; he hangs his head once more, and turns to walk back toward the Citadel steps once again]<br />
Prompto: And ever since then, I&#8217;ve lived my life in fear:</p>
<p>[Young Prompto sits down on the steps]<br />
Prompto: that, one day, they&#8217;d find out who I really was, and they wouldn&#8217;t want me anymore.</p>
<p>[Young Prompto looks up as this vision fills with memories of Prompto&#8217;s journey with Noct, Gladio and Ignis, culminating in his memory of Noctis attacking him atop the train from which he fell; after a fade to white, Prompto awakens laying face down on the floor in a research lab; he grunts, looks around him, and slowly gets up onto one knee; he also now realizes the bracelet he wore to hide the barcode on the back of his right wrist is missing]<br />
Prompto: It&#8217;s gone.</p>
<p>[He stands]<br />
Prompto: What&#8230; What is this place?<br />

<p>Verstael:<br />
Research log: Year 722, Day 189. I received a proposal regarding a way to improve the infantry&#8217;s performance by leaps and bounds: outfit the troopers with magitek cores. Preliminary tests suggest sublimating daemons for fuel will result in an unstable infantry unfit for the field. If the calculations <em>he</em> provided are correct, though, this could solve all our problems. The Deathless Project marks the advent of a new age. No longer will our soldiers fall on the field of battle. The empire shall rise, and soon, all the world shall bask in our glory!<br />

<p>(upon inspecting a control panel beside a closed set of sliding metal doors)<br />
[Prompto lays his right hand on the panel; a feminine automated voice begins speaking]<br />
Announcement: Scanning production code.</p>
<p>[Prompto gasps and looks around him; he takes a step back as the automated voice continues]<br />
Announcement: Unit 05953234 confirmed.</p>
<p>[The metal doors before him slide open; Prompto looks down at his barcode; the voice speaks once more]<br />
Announcement: Warning: this unit has been compromised. Initiating retrieval of compromised unit.<br />
Prompto: What&#8217;s going on?</p>
<p>[Suddenly, Ardyn&#8217;s voice mockingly chimes in from behind Prompto]<br />
Ardyn: She still remembers you, after all these years.</p>
<p>[Prompto turns to face him]<br />
Prompto: You&#8230;</p>
<p>[Prompto tries to conjure his weapon, but nothing appears; he looks down at his hand]<br />
Prompto: What gives?</p>
<p>[As Ardyn walks toward Prompto, he pulls out the confused younger man&#8217;s gun and waves it aloft]<br />
Ardyn: We can&#8217;t have you spilling blood here.</p>
<p>[Prompto takes a step back]<br />
Ardyn: Although to most this compound is known only as the First Magitek Production Facility, birthplace of the myriad magitek troopers and daemons the empire holds dear, to <em>you</em> this place should have some sentimental value. After all, it is your home sweet home.</p>
<p>[Prompto&#8217;s expression becomes intense]<br />
Prompto: Shut up.<br />
Ardyn: I&#8217;m not the one who almost killed you.<br />
Prompto: You&#8217;re wro—</p>
<p>[Ardyn suddenly lets Prompto&#8217;s gun turn upside down over his finger, and shoves its handle against Prompto&#8217;s chest; Prompto reaches up to grab it and Ardyn releases it into Prompto&#8217;s hand; Ardyn then takes a step back]<br />
Ardyn: You really ought to take a rest.</p>
<p>[Ardyn continues taking steps back]<br />
Ardyn: Perhaps the estimable Chief Besithia will help heal that broken heart of yours.<br />
Prompto: &#8230;Who the hell is that?<br />
Ardyn: Oh, how quickly they forget. But fear not: I&#8217;ve no doubt a reunion would refresh your memory.</p>
<p>[Ardyn turns and begins walking away; Prompto raises his gun and points it after Ardyn, but he&#8217;s already vanished; Prompto lowers and holsters the gun]<br />
Prompto: I&#8217;m gonna find &#8217;em—wherever they are.</p>
<p>[Prompto leaves the room]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[After rounding the corner of the hallway outside the room, Prompto spots a magitek trooper at the other end of another hallway; a message appears]<br />
Imperial soldiers are patrolling the area.<br />

&#8212;</p>
<p>[Upon proceeding through the sliding doors at the end of this hall into a shorter one, Prompto finds windows to his left overlooking a large, open room filled with many dormant magitek troopers]<br />

<p>Verstael:<br />
Research log: Year 722, Day 294. I acted on the proposal mentioned in my log of Day 189. My attempts to infuse the troopers&#8217; magitek cores with daemonic energy proved successful. Only in the most basic sense, however. While the soldiers are indeed deathless, they are far from fit for fighting. Thus, I&#8217;ve decided to take a different approach: rather than relying on daemons to power the magitek infantry, why not use humans instead? Frankly, I had never considered employing my fellow man in any magitek related experiments. But countless men and women succumb to the plasmodia each day. Rather than let them die victims of an ignominious disease, why not help them ascend to nobler heights? I&#8217;ve lost many a comrade on the field of battle, and I&#8217;ve no intention of allowing any more of their deaths to go in vain.</p>
<p>Prompto: How could he even think of using those innocent people for his twisted experiments?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<div class="spdiv">[collapse]</div>

<p>[Proceeding into an even shorter hallway, Prompto spots another magitek trooper at the end]<br />
Prompto: I can&#8217;t let them find me.</p>
<p>[Another strategy message appears]<br />
Approach an enemy undetected to deliver a stealth-kill.</p>
<p>Strategy<br />
Land a stealth-kill.</p>
<p>[After Prompto has performed this stealth-kill, he takes the downed soldier&#8217;s Rapidus SMG, and more messages appear]<br />

<p>Verstael:<br />
Research log: Year 722, Day 339. Another day, another mental breakdown. All my tests so far have resulted in the former soldiers suffering ego deaths. Today, however, I developed a new hypothesis: I will continue to sublimate daemonified humans to harvest the miasma, but, if a sense of self is the source of these snags, why not inject <em>infants</em> with the plasmodia instead? We&#8217;ve little time. If we are to combat the Lucian threat, we must explore new options. I, too, will set aside my personal misgivings and do what I must for the empire.</p>

<p>(upon approaching a staircase leading to the next area)<br />

<p>[Two magitek troopers come into sight at the top of the stairs, and another message appears]<br />

<p>(after eliminating the additional MTs)<br />
Prompto: I&#8217;ve just gotta find my way out.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Making his way out of this large room, Prompto travels a short way down a hall, passes through some sliding doors, then exits the facility onto a snowy cliffside overlooking a mountain range; after a brief walk down the path here, Prompto has to enter the facility once again through another pair of sliding doors; after making his way down a lengthy hall, Prompto finds himself in what appears to be a workplace lounge area]</p>

<p>In order to better monitor the large number of new magitek models entering production, the Imperial Defense Council motions to reform the coding system as follows:</p>

Research log: Year 723, Day 70. I pondered how I might find the necessary number of infants, and then it dawned on me: why not make them myself? If I clone them from my own genes, I can eliminate the pesky process of breeding them. Mass production remains a pipe dream for now, but I&#8217;m confident I can creative a massive infantry once the process picks up. If everything goes according to plan, the empire will boast a million-man army in no time at all.</p>

<p>Verstael:<br />
Research log: Year 736, Day 123. It seems my laboratory is not nearly as secure as I once believed. Some thief―likely a Lucian―made off with one of my experiments. Absconding with a single infant will do nothing to enlighten them of the grandeur of my research. That said, I will see to it such an incident never arises again. I&#8217;ve posted magitek troopers around the facility and instructed them to keep a vigilant watch. It <em>is</em> their home, after all.</p>
<p>Prompto: The kingdom kidnapped one of those infants? Does that mean, I&#8230;? No, it couldn&#8217;t be. There&#8217;s no way.<br />

<p>[When Prompto attempts to exit this room through the sliding doors opposite those he came in through, he&#8217;s immediately greeted by a magitek trooper axeman crackling with leaking energy; the MT swings its weapon at Prompto, who catches it by its haft, sending him over backward with the MT on top of him; Prompto is able to shove the magitek trooper off him, at which point its physical deterioration reaches critical; the magitek trooper breaks down and dies while Prompto gets back to his feet; a moment later, the automated voice from before speaks]<br />
Announcement: Target detected. Eliminate immediately.<br />
Prompto: I can&#8217;t take this anymore.<br />

<p>[Prompto enters another large open room similar to the one he passed through before his exit onto the snowy cliffside from earlier; as he makes his way through this room, several MTs enter]<br />
Prompto: Let&#8217;s do this.</p>
<p>[After eliminating all the MTs in the room, Prompto reaches a circular passageway closed by metallic petals that originate from along the perimeter of the circle and meet at its center; a small control panel similar to the one Prompto activated after waking up earlier sits beside the entrance to the passageway; Prompto looks down at his barcode, grits his teeth and places his wrist over the control panel; the passageway opens]<br />
Prompto: &#8230;Lucky me.</p>
<p>[A moment later, Prompto speaks his thoughts again]<br />
Prompto: &#8230;What the hell am I?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[After making his way down the newly opened passageway, Prompto enters a room containing several large glass cylinders, each holding a human figure resembling Prompto]<br />

Verstael: What&#8217;s the matter? Have you never seen a man turn before?</p>
<p>[Verstael turns to face Prompto; the right side of his face is becoming daemonified, and appears similar to the left side of Ravus&#8217;s face near the end of Chapter 13 in the main game]<br />
Verstael: If those Lucians hadn&#8217;t intervened, <em>you</em> could have turned, too.<br />
Prompto: Why me?<br />
Verstael: Because you were cloned from this genius&#8217;s genes, born of my own flesh and blood. You are but one of millions created to serve our great empire in the magitek infantry.<br />
Prompto: Created&#8230;to serve you?<br />
Verstael: Yes—and now you&#8217;ve finally come home to Niflheim, my son.</p>
<p>[Prompto fires his gun into the air]<br />
Prompto: Shut up!</p>
<p>[Prompto hangs his head, his gun still pointed aloft for a moment before letting it hang by his side]<br />
Prompto: You&#8217;re wrong&#8230; I&#8217;m a Lucian!</p>
<p>[Tears begin to go down Prompto&#8217;s face]<br />
Prompto: I am not one of your experiments!</p>
<p>[Verstael begins slowly walking toward Prompto]<br />
Verstael: Not anymore. Now, you&#8217;re nothing but a <em>failure</em>. I ought to return you whence you came. Perhaps then you might serve some useful purpose.</p>
<p>[Verstael has nearly walked up to Prompto by now; he reaches out to grab him]<br />
Prompto: Never!</p>
<p>[Prompto raises his gun and points it at Verstael, who laughs; he begins speaking with a daemonic echo; as he does, Prompto lowers his gun in horror]<br />
Verstael: With your help, my ascension to divinity is now all but complete. </p>
<p>[He holds his right hand out and grabs Prompto&#8217;s shoulder]<br />
Verstael: Soon, neither the kings of Lucis nor the gods themselves will be able to challenge my reign!</p>
<p>[Verstael reaches out with his left hand and grabs Prompto&#8217;s face; Prompto screams, raises his gun and fires; a cloud of dark smoke emerges from where Prompto&#8217;s shot pierces Verstael&#8217;s chest; Verstael groans and falls onto his back; Prompto looks down at Verstael in shock for a moment before dropping his gun and falling to his knees; after a moment of silence, Ardyn&#8217;s voice can be heard gasping in faux horror]<br />
Ardyn: Look what you&#8217;ve done. You&#8217;ve gone homicidal—no, patricidal!<br />
Prompto: No&#8230;<br />
Ardyn: You lose your friends and murder your family. Now you&#8217;ve no one left!</p>
<p>[Ardyn begins laughing]<br />
Prompto: Shut up!</p>
<p>[Prompto begins beating the floor with each time he repeats himself]<br />
Prompto: Shut up, shut up, shut up!</p>
<p>[The automated voice heard throughout the facility up to now begins speaking once again]<br />
Announcement: Vital functions decreasing. Plasmodium index activity increasing.</p>
<p>[Prompto looks up at Verstael&#8217;s body to see that it has now completely discorporated into the dark smoke that was rising from it, leaving empty clothing behind]<br />
Announcement: Daemonification complete. Initiating transfer to Unit XDA-1002: Immortalis.</p>
<p>[The dark smoke from Verstael enters machinery at the center of the room; the lighting in the room turns red as the machinery begins to move; the room itself begins to shake; Prompto looks around him in confusion; suddenly, the roof caves in about twenty feet from Prompto, the body of an Iron Giant having fallen through from somewhere above; Aranea Highwind stands atop the daemon&#8217;s body, her lance in hand and impaling the daemon]</p>
<p>Aranea: You always play hard to get like this?</p>
<p>[She hops down from the daemon&#8217;s corpse and walks toward Prompto]<br />
Prompto: Aranea&#8230;<br />
Aranea: Save it, Blondie. On your feet!</p>
<p>[Prompto doesn&#8217;t move; after a moment of waiting for him, Aranea puts her hands on her hips, then walks away from Prompto to a countertop with blueprints spread out upon it; she looks them over]</p>
<p>Aranea: So <em>this</em> is that new model they&#8217;re working on.</p>
<p>[After another moment, she turns her attention back to Prompto]<br />
Aranea: I dunno what&#8217;s got you so shook, but you can deal with it later. Let&#8217;s move.</p>
<p>[Prompto just looks at the floor; after a few seconds, Aranea walks over to him, grabs him by the collar of his jacket and pulls him up enough to straighten out his back; she looks him in the eye]<br />
Aranea: I&#8217;m only gonna say this once: </p>
<p>[She jerks him to his feet]<br />
Aranea: Lose your will to live, and you lose all hope of me helping your sorry ass. Got it?</p>
<p>[The facility&#8217;s automated voice speaks again]<br />
Announcement: Target detected. Capture and retrieve immediately.</p>
<p>[Aranea conjures her lance in preparation for battle; the dormant magitek troopers along the wall of the room awaken; several Ice Bomb daemons also appear]<br />
Announcement: Commence capture and retrieval of compromised unit.</p>
<p>[Aranea rushes ahead to clear the way; following her out of the room and down a hall, Prompto finds himself on a platform overlooking a cargo bay; a snowmobile sits below by an exit out of the facility; a timer counting down from three minutes appears along with a message]<br />
Escape the facility before the gate closes.</p>

<p>[The platform becomes swarmed by Snaga and Alberich daemons in addition to whatever other assailants from before remain; Aranea works to help Prompto get past them]<br />

(upon taking out several of the daemons, if Prompto hasn&#8217;t yet reached the snowmobile)<br />
Aranea: They&#8217;re down. Now&#8217;s your chance!</p>
<div class="spdiv">[collapse]</div>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>[Moving down the staircase at the end of the platform, Prompto still has to get past a cargo bay filled with magitek troopers wielding guns, an MA Veles magitek armor and any remaining daemons; when he reaches the snowmobile, Aranea shoves a map against his chest]<br />
Aranea: Head there—I&#8217;ll catch up later.</p>
<p>[Prompto takes the map; Aranea turns and heads back toward their enemies]<br />
Prompto: But what about you?</p>
<p>[She conjures her lance as she&#8217;s confronted by an Ice Bomb and a Snaga, with more daemons still manifesting]<br />
Aranea: I said I&#8217;ll catch up.<br />
Prompto: But what if y—<br />
Aranea: Just go!</p>
<p>[Prompto gets on the snowmobile; a message appears]<br />
Prompto will take damage when hit while riding the snowmobile.<br />
When HP is low, hop off and use a restorative to recover health.</p>
<p>Hop on or off the snowmobile with x.<br />
Hold R2 to speed up, and hold L2 to slow down or back up.<br />

<p>Press L1 to adjust your view.<br />
Tilt [right analog stick] to look around.<br />
Hold  or R1 to fire while driving.</p>
<p>[Prompto rides the snowmobile out of the facility]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Initially, Prompto faces fire from magitek troopers wielding guns while he races across the snowscape, but he&#8217;s soon under fire by missiles launched from drop ships as well, in addition to taking fire from three MA Hoplomachus magitek armors further along the path; after eventually going over a cliff, Prompto falls from the snowmobile and comes to a stop on his side; he slowly rolls onto his back and lay there looking up for a moment at the falling snow and his rising breath; he shuts his eyes]<br />
Prompto: Catch ya later, Aranea&#8230;</p>
<p>[After a quiet moment passes, Prompto pushes himself to his feet and stands silently looking into the sky; he eventually returns to the snowmobile and makes his way to the rendezvous point marked on the map Aranea gave him]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[After nightfall at Decratom Haven, Prompto waits for Aranea by the campfire; he&#8217;s eating food from a can]<br />
Prompto: Almost as good as what Iggy used to make.</p>
<p>[He sets the can down]<br />
Prompto: Well, at least it&#8217;s quiet for a change.</p>
<p>[After a moment, he pulls the sleeve of his jacket back to reveal the barcode on the back of his wrist; he grunts and grits his teeth, then begins frantically trying to scratch the barcode away; it doesn&#8217;t work]<br />
Prompto: Damnit!</p>
<p>[He looks into the fire, reaches down and picks up a burning stick; he looks down at his barcode and begins lowering the stick toward it; he holds the burning wood above his barcode and begins breathing heavily; a prompt appears to select either &#8220;Burn wrist&#8221; or &#8220;Give up&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Burn wrist<br />
[Prompto places the stick onto his wrist and screams as the skin sizzles; he drops the stick after a moment and grips his burned wrist with his other hand; after a moment, he removes his hand and begins chuckling]<br />
Prompto: &#8230;Branded for life.</p>
<p>[He hangs his head; suddenly, Aranea speaks up]<br />
Aranea: Don&#8217;t tell me you thought that would work.</p>
<p>[He looks up at her]<br />
Aranea: &#8220;Prompto,&#8221; right?</p>
<p>[She walks over to him, takes his right hand and uses a potion on his burn; she then sits down by the fire with him]<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Give up<br />
[Prompto hesitates and drops the stick; it rolls away]<br />
Prompto: What the hell am I thinking?</p>
<p>[He hangs his head; suddenly, Aranea speaks up]<br />
Aranea: Don&#8217;t tell me you thought that would work.</p>
<p>[She walks over and sits down by the fire with him]<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>Aranea: You could at least look happy to see me.</p>
<p>[Prompto just looks down, saying nothing]<br />
Aranea: I ran into your buddies in Tenebrae.</p>
<p>[He looks up]<br />
Aranea: You&#8217;ve got &#8217;em worried sick.</p>
<p>[Prompto looks back down]<br />
You gonna go see &#8217;em or what?</p>
<p>[After a brief moment of silence, Prompto finally speaks]<br />
Prompto: I&#8230; I can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>[Aranea stares at him as he goes silent for another moment]<br />
Prompto: I can&#8217;t. &#8230;I&#8217;m not like them. I was born here—in Niflheim. All this time and I&#8217;ve never told them. And that&#8217;s not even the worst part. I wasn&#8217;t born into a happy family. I was <em>made</em>—created in some laboratory. The entire reason I exist is to make Noct and all of them miserable. How could I possibly see them? They&#8217;d never accept the real me.</p>
<p>[Aranea smiles]<br />
Aranea: You spent all that time driving around together and you still don&#8217;t know what kinda guys <em>they</em> really are. In case you forgot, your princely pal and I weren&#8217;t always on such friendly terms. But you know what? He put all that aside and asked me to make sure you were safe.<br />
Prompto: &#8230;He did?<br />
Aranea: Think he&#8217;d do that for someone who &#8220;makes him miserable&#8221;?</p>
<p>[A prompt appears asking &#8220;What should I ask her?&#8221;; the player can select either &#8220;Ask about the guys,&#8221; &#8220;Ask about me&#8221; or &#8220;Nothing&#8221;; choosing &#8220;Nothing&#8221; skips ahead to the next part of the conversation]</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Ask about the guys<br />
Prompto: Is everybody okay?<br />
Aranea: All things considered, I guess. Sounds like they&#8217;ve been through a lot since you left, but they&#8217;re still dead set on getting to the capital.<br />
Prompto: &#8230;Hope they make it.<br />
Aranea: They&#8217;d have a better shot with you around.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Ask about me</p>
<p>Prompto: Did they say anything else about me?<br />
Aranea: Not that I can recall.<br />
Prompto: &#8230;Right.<br />
Aranea: His Highness was so worried about you he could barely speak, but don&#8217;t worry—I whipped him into shape.<br />
Prompto: So&#8230;he doesn&#8217;t hate me after all.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Aranea stands]<br />
Aranea: Look—I can tell you want to get back together with them. So why not let them know?</p>
<p>[She begins walking away]<br />
Prompto: You think they&#8217;d let me back? After all this?</p>
<p>[She stops and turns back toward him; after a brief silence, Prompto speaks again]<br />
Prompto: And even if they did let me back, I&#8217;d probably cause them nothing but trouble. I don&#8217;t know how I could live with myself&#8230;</p>
<p>[Aranea exclaims in frustration and begins walking back toward him]<br />
Aranea: Because you&#8217;re doing such a great job of living with yourself now.</p>
<p>[She kicks him onto his back and crouches down over him]<br />
Aranea: What <em>do</em> you want then? You worry so much about what other people want from you that you don&#8217;t even know what <em>you</em> want anymore! Your life isn&#8217;t yours to live!</p>
<p>[Aranea grabs both sides of his hand in her hands]<br />
Aranea: Forget about what everyone else thinks for a second and figure out what it is you&#8217;re really after here.</p>
<p>[She stands and takes a few steps]<br />
Aranea: I&#8217;m going after that new model in the morning. You&#8217;re on your own now, kid.</p>
<p>[She leaves; Prompto remains on his back for a long moment before finally pushing himself back up into a huddled position]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[In the morning, Prompto hears barking; following it into a forest, he finds a magitek trooper axeman laying on its back in the snow; he sits down in front of it and closes his eyes; he seemingly falls asleep, and when he awakens, night has fallen and the magitek trooper has gone; realizing someone is behind him, Prompto leaps to his feet and turns, finding what seems to be Noctis conjuring his Engine Blade and walking toward him; Prompto begins stepping back and raises his hand to ask Noctis to stop; through Prompto&#8217;s eyes, however, the hand he&#8217;s holding up appears to be that of a magitek trooper; Prompto begins to run away while Noctis warp-strikes after him and swings his blade at him]<br />
Noctis: This&#8217;ll be quick.</p>
<p>[After getting away from &#8220;Noctis,&#8221; Prompto looks down at his hands and sees that they appear to be his own again; suddenly, he hears more barking and turns to see what appears to be Pryna trotting away; he follows her until they emerge into an open snowfield with several magitek troopers scattered about, seemingly dead; one of them, laying on its back, is still somewhat functional, however; it raises its hand toward Prompto, as though pleading for help; Prompto stares into its eyes; suddenly, his eyes widen and he&#8217;s seeing himself laying in the snow reaching out with his hand for help; Prompto shakes off the vision and looks back at the MT, seeing it for what it is once more; he then slowly, shakily raises his gun; briefly, he lowers his weapon and looks away; he then just as quickly finds his resolve, raises the gun once more as he sheds a tear, takes aim and pulls the trigger; the scene cuts to black briefly; when it fades back in, the figure of Prompto as a child is sitting huddled by the now dead magitek trooper; Prompto kneels behind him and places his hand on his child self&#8217;s back; the scene fades to a vision of Prompto as a child sitting on the steps of the Citadel looking up at falling sylleblossom petals; as young Prompto traces a petal toward the ground, he discovers Pryna sitting in front of him with a letter in her mouth; he reaches out and takes the letter from the divine canine, unfolds it and reads it; it&#8217;s from Lunafreya, and we hear her voice]<br />
Lunafreya: All I ask is that you continue to support Noctis, and that you remain ever at his side.</p>
<p>[Young Prompto pulls a few photographs from among the pages of the letter; we then hear the voice of his child self speak his anxieties]<br />
Prompto: How does she expect someone like <em>me</em> to support <em>him</em>? Am I good enough?</p>
<p>[We can now see that the first photograph in the child&#8217;s hands is the photo Cindy took of Prompto, Noctis, Ignis and Gladio at Hammerhead early in their adventure]<br />
Prompto: Does he want me around?</p>
<p>[Young Prompto pulls the top photo aside and the second we see is one of the royal retinue at the Wiz Chocobo Post]<br />
Prompto: Is that really what Noct and everyone else want? For me to be with them?</p>
<p>[Young Prompto pulls this second photo aside, revealing the photo taken at Cape Caem before the royal retinue departed for Altissia; the child then speaks aloud]<br />
Prompto: Wait—but what about <em>me</em>? What do <em>I</em> want?</p>
<p>[Young Prompto stands and becomes his adult self as he does so; adult Prompto also speaks out loud]<br />
Prompto: It took me a while, but I finally found my answer.</p>
<p>[He bends down and picks his camera up off the steps, then looks up at the Citadel]<br />
Prompto: It&#8217;s time.</p>
<p>[Prompto runs up the steps and the scene fades to white; when it fades back in, Prompto opens his eyes; he&#8217;s sitting on the ground with his camera in his hand; he stands and walks on]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[When the next scene begins, Aranea is walking to her snowmobile; Prompto suddenly speaks]<br />
Prompto: Aranea.</p>
<p>[She turns]<br />
Prompto: I&#8217;m ready.</p>
<p>[He walks up to her]<br />
Prompto: I thought about what you said, and I&#8217;ve decided to face my fears once and for all. I can&#8217;t choose where I came from, but I can choose where I&#8217;m going.<br />
Aranea: Alright—but slow me down and you&#8217;re going to get left behind.</p>
<p>[She smiles at him]<br />

<p><em>So thanks to yesterday&#8217;s fiasco, my boss made<br />

ATTN: Research Chief Verstael Besithia<br />
It has come to my attention that the Glacian&#8217;s recent assault was quelled by your magitek infantry. As commendation for your service to our great nation, I have approved your petition to increase funding for your research.<br />

<p>Verstael:<br />
Research log: Year 745, Day 325. Today marks a momentous triumph for our great nation. The Glacian herself graced us with her presence in the Ghorovas Rift, and, through the combined efforts of the magitek infantry and my precious daemons, we killed her. The resulting casualties were great, but these sacrifices afforded us something far more valuable than a few units. With the data I collected, I intend to begin developing a new magitek weapon codenamed &#8220;Godslayer.&#8221; Soon, all the Astrals shall bow before me and the might of my magitek. Soon, they shall know my wrath.</p>
<p>Prompto: What the hell is wrong with this guy?<br />

<center>Proposal for Operation: Countersign<br />
M.E. 755-IX-18th</center></p>
<p>As Deputy High Commander, I hereby propose a large-scale assault on the Lucian capital of Insomnia. Preparations are to begin next month.</p>
<p>Our future is far too precious to entrust to our enemy. We must retrieve the Crystal and Ring of legend; only then shall our world know true peace.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 650px;">Research Log: 724-X-24th</p>
<p>Verstael:<br />
Research log: Year 724, Day 297. Mass production of the magitek infantry was a success. We&#8217;ve overwhelmed the Lucians with our numbers and surrounded Insomnia. But to rest on our laurels now would be unthinkable. On occasion, harvesting the plasmodic miasma produces some &#8220;side effects.&#8221; The daemons born of this process have been disposed of on sight—until now. How foolish I was to let these sublime creatures go to waste! What they lack in adaptability, they make up for in sheer power. I realize now that I ought to channel my efforts into exploring the true potential of these daemons for the sake of the empire. Perhaps this has been my true calling all along.</p>
<p>Prompto: He&#8217;s mad. This guy has completely lost his mind.<br />

<center>Report on Unit SAS-0822<br />
M.E. 756-V-21st</center></p>
<p>After several years of experimentation, we have finally succeeded in fusing mammal and magitek. Although we are still conducting various tests on Codename: Barbarus, the unit should be functional enough to fend off would-be intruders until development finishes on Unit XDA-1002: Immortalis.<br />

<p>Verstael:<br />
Research log: Year 756, Day 190. At long last, my life&#8217;s work is complete. Not only have I found a way to preserve the ego, I&#8217;ve also managed to sustain that consciousness through the sublimation process and transfer it into my magitek troopers. The prototype has proven slightly less powerful than the Diamond Weapon, but this presents no real problem. After all, one&#8217;s consciousness can be transmuted again and again and again. All that remains is to fully surrender myself to my research and become my own final test subject. I will conclude my mortal life by offering a word of thanks. Chancellor Ardyn Izunia, your assistance has proved invaluable. You have my eternal gratitude. It is through your aid that I have completed my work and begun my ascension to an existence beyond divinity.</p>
<p>Prompto: Of course it was Ardyn&#8230; Everywhere we go, his name just keeps coming up. Everything that&#8217;s happened to us, it&#8217;s all his fault.<br />
&#8212;</p>

<p>[Prompto and Aranea enter one more room; here, they are greeted by a large half-mammal, half-magitek creature, the Unit SAS-0822: Barbarus spoken of in the final document found in the hallway outside this room; the remains of dead magitek troopers litter the room; the fusion of mammal and magitek immediately attacks the intruders]<br />
Prompto: Bring it on!</p>
<p>[Aranea and Prompto manage to kill the creature; once they have, they stand a few feet from its crackling remains; Prompto is gasping to catch his breath while Aranea is composed]<br />
Prompto: Made it out alive.</p>
<p>[The room suddenly begins to shake]<br />
Prompto: What&#8217;s going on?</p>
<p>[The facility&#8217;s automated voice speaks one more time]<br />
Announcement: Unit XDA-1002: Immortalis. Plasmodic miasma transfer complete. No psychic obstructions detected. All systems operational. Activating Immortalis.</p>
<p>[Prompto has a realization]<br />
Prompto: It&#8217;s outside!</p>
<p>[He and Aranea run back to the surface; once there, they see what Verstael&#8217;s &#8220;life&#8217;s work&#8221; has amounted to: an enormous magitek-powered worm; in place of a head, it features an enormous cannon with seven rotating components resembling drill bits spinning around the core]<br />
Prompto: It&#8217;s gigantic&#8230;</p>
<p>[Aranea runs off out of sight to acquire something]<br />
Prompto: So that&#8217;s the &#8220;new model&#8221;&#8230; And that means&#8230;<em>he</em> must be inside that thing.</p>
<p>[Aranea pulls up beside Prompto on another snowmobile, this one with a large machine gun mounted on the back]<br />
Aranea: Hop on!</p>
<p>[Prompto hops on as Aranea drives them away from the research facility with the Godslayer in hot pursuit]<br />
Aranea: Ready for round two?</p>
<p>[Prompto grabs hold of the gun&#8217;s firing mechanism]<br />
Prompto: You bet!</p>
<p>[Verstael speaks from within Immortalis as he pursues his &#8220;son&#8221; and Aranea]<br />
Verstael: Long have I waited to smite the world that denied me the glory I rightly deserve—and now, all shall tremble before me, man and maker alike!</p>
<p>[A message appears]<br />
Use the machine gun to take down Unit XDA-1002: Immortalis.<br />
If Prompto is overtaken, the game will be over.</p>
<p>Tilt [left analog stick] or [right analog stick] to take aim.<br />
Hold L1 or L2 to zoom in and out.<br />
Press R1 or R2 to fire.</p>
<p>Prompto: If that&#8217;s really him&#8230;<br />
Aranea: That maniac&#8217;s taken &#8220;biological warfare&#8221; to the next level.<br />
Prompto: &#8230;then I want to be the one to take him down.</p>
<p>[The Godslayer rises from hiding under the ground at one point during its pursuit]<br />
Aranea: Down below!<br />
Prompto: It&#8217;s enormous!</p>
<p>[Verstael maintains his pursuit]<br />
Verstael: Fall to your knees before me!</p>
<p>[Under Prompto&#8217;s unrelenting barrage, a component around the head of Immortalis explodes; soon after, the worm burrows underground]<br />
Aranea: It ain&#8217;t over.</p>
<p>[The Godslayer emerges from the snow once more]<br />
Aranea: Three o&#8217;clock!</p>
<p>[Energy begins building at the tips of the mighty worm&#8217;s drill-like components]<br />
Aranea: Incoming—look out!</p>
<p>[The machine begins firing energy at Prompto and Aranea; Prompto targets these components and begins dismantling them]<br />
Aranea: Sharp shooting, kid. Keep it up!</p>
<p>[After Prompto has disabled all but the last of the Immortalis&#8217;s drill-like components]<br />
Prompto: This ends now.</p>
<p>[When Prompto delivers what appears to be the finishing blow to the last drill-like component, there&#8217;s a violent explosion and the Godslayer lifts high into the air before crumpling across the snowy landscape in a mangled heap; as it lay in the snow, seemingly burnt out, the core of the worm&#8217;s head begins to glow red from within; the drill-like components become illuminated as well; Verstael&#8217;s voice drips out of the machine as Immortalis rises and takes up the pursuit once more]<br />
Verstael: How can this be? I will not allow it!</p>
<p>[Prompto continues firing away at the Godslayer as it begins charging enormous energy to fire at he and Aranea; when half of the machine&#8217;s remaining life has been depleted, it looms over the snowmobile carrying Verstael&#8217;s &#8220;failure&#8221; with its cannon nearly fully charged]<br />
Prompto: This is it!</p>
<p>[When the killing blow lands, explosions rock the Godslayer, and Verstael roars as his creation comes crashing to the ground in shambles; Aranea speeds herself and Prompto away from the machine&#8217;s ruin; some time later, Prompto and Aranea stand in the snow looking out over the remains of the magitek colossus Verstael had fancied capable of challenging the gods]<br />
Aranea: You alright?<br />
Prompto: Yeah. This is what I wanted.<br />
Aranea: Then say it like you mean it. You did good, kid.</p>
<p>[Prompto takes up a whimsical pose, and with an equally whimsical voice points at Aranea while saying his next line]<br />
Prompto: Couldn&#8217;t have done it without <em>you</em>, gurl!</p>
<p>[He takes back up a normal stance and sober voice]<br />
Prompto: &#8230;Seriously, though. Well, I&#8217;d better catch up with Noct and the guys. He&#8217;s got a lot on his plate, and I figure he could probably use a hand taking back the Crystal and all that. And who knows? Maybe <em>I&#8217;ll</em> take it back before <em>he</em> does!</p>
<p>[Prompto runs over to the snowmobile and leans down on it; Aranea walks over to him]<br />
Aranea: Don&#8217;t get ahead of yourself.<br />
Prompto: Honestly, I don&#8217;t know for sure if they&#8217;re going to accept me for who I really am. But I&#8217;ll never know if I don&#8217;t speak up, so I&#8217;m gonna tell &#8217;em.</p>
<p>[Prompto stands and turns back to Aranea]<br />
Prompto: After all, it&#8217;s my life to live.<br />
Aranea: The boy has become a man. Anyway, Gralea&#8217;s straight ahead.</p>
<p>[Prompto gets on the snowmobile and prepares to leave; he stops]<br />
Prompto: Aranea!</p>
<p>[She smiles at him]<br />
Aranea: Yeah?</p>
<p>[He smiles back]<br />
Prompto: Thanks!</p>
<p>[Prompto speeds away; Aranea watches him as he goes; unbeknownst to him, from a nearby cliff, the imperial chancellor is also watching; Ardyn mimics Prompto vocalizing the Final Fantasy victory theme and grins; the scene fades to black; against this black screen, the sound of cell doors clanging shut can be heard; the scene eventually transitions to Prompto awakening in his cell in Zegnautus Keep, struggling vainly to pull his hands free of his manacles, and then giving up; the scene fades to black once more, then fades in again to show Prompto hanging unconscious from the contraption in his cell in the background of the frame while implements of torture occupy the foreground; the scene fades to black again, then fades in once more to Prompto awakening as he is rescued from his cell by Noct and the others during Chapter 13 of the main game; he awakens to see them run into his cell and begin frantically pulling at his manacles; the visuals from the scene of them freeing him in the main game are then shown; after another brief fade to black, the scene fades in to show Prompto sitting on a bed in one of the dormitories of Zegnautus Keep; Noctis approaches, hesitates, then sits down on the opposite side of the bed, leaving the two facing away from one another]<br />
Noctis: Hey, I&#8217;m&#8230;sorry.<br />
Prompto: For what?<br />
Noct: For falling right into his trap&#8230;and for hurting you like that.</p>
<p>[Prompto takes up a wry tone]<br />
Prompto: I know, right? How could you possibly do such a horrible thing—after everything we&#8217;ve been through!?</p>
<p>[Prompto returns to a normal tone]<br />
Prompto: Nah, it&#8217;s okay. You&#8217;re not the only one who fell for it.<br />
Noct: Once this is all over, I say we break down the borders—come together as one nation.</p>
<p>[Prompto turns to look at Noct; the young king crosses his arms and tries to seem nonchalant]<br />
Noctis: I mean, what does it matter where you&#8217;re from anyway?</p>
<p>[Prompto stands and turns to look at Noctis]<br />
Prompto: Y&#8217;know, I never thought I&#8217;d say this, but you sounded like a real king for a second.</p>
<p>[Noct appears surprised by the comment and turns to look at his friend; Prompto grins]<br />
Noct: Better late than never. I&#8217;m gonna make this world a better place. You with me?</p>
<p>[Noct smiles]<br />
Prompto: Uh-huh. Ever at your side.</p>
<p>[Prompto smiles as well]<br />

<h3>Assassin&#8217;s Festival</h3>
<p>In Lestallum, a tale is told: a story about the looming shadow of oppression, and a hero who rose in resistance. Though no historical account exists, the legend nevertheless survives, telling of a nameless hero known as &#8220;the Assassin.&#8221;<br />

<p>[The scene opens on a white-cloaked figure standing atop a wooden tower between the main thoroughfare and the outlook in Lestallum; the camera moves in on the figure&#8217;s face; it&#8217;s Noctis; pigeons fly around him; Noctis looks downward and spots Commander Loqi Tummelt of the Niflheim Empire walking at ground level flanked by two magitek troopers]<br />
Noctis: Gotcha.</p>
<p>[Noctis takes the Leap of Faith from atop the tower into a hay wagon below; Prompto approaches the wagon as Noctis gets out]<br />
Prompto: Well? Did you see him?<br />
Noctis: Yep. This way.<br />
Prompto: Got it!</p>

Noct: Time to take him down.</p>
<p>[Noct and Prompto begin tracking Loqi down the alleyways of Lestallum; he&#8217;s still accompanied by magitek troopers, and the alleyways are teeming with more]<br />
Noct: Ugh, these guys are everywhere.<br />
Prompto: Not over here. C&#8217;mon!</p>
<p>[The camera pans over to a barricaded alleyway in which there are no magitek troopers; Noct climbs the obstacles in the way and proceeds down this alley; from here, he and Prompto continue tailing Loqi and his detail]<br />
Prompto: I bet they wouldn&#8217;t see you up there!</p>
<p>[Noct point-warps to a balcony above the next set of alleys and continues following Loqi from the vantage of the rooftops]<br />
Prompto: Keep going, Noct!</p>

Prompto: Woohoo! Assassin&#8217;s Festival, here we come!<br />
Noct: I&#8217;m so hyped. I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s finally here!<br />
Ignis: Need I remind you there&#8217;s an imperial bounty on your head? Keep it in check.<br />

Prompto: Ooh, look at all these posters!<br />

Gladiolus: What&#8217;s got these two so excited all of a sudden?<br />
Ignis: The two of them happen to be rather fond of the <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em> series.<br />

(quest description for the Assassin&#8217;s Festival)<br />
For generations, Lestallum has held an annual festival in honor of the famous Assassin who saved the town from oppression. As a huge fan of the subculture this local legend inspired, Noctis drags his friends along to take part in the festivities.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[If the player tries to have Noctis proceed up the parking ramp or toward the outlook, two of his friends will call out to him and stop him; each of their lines is transcribed below]<br />
Ignis: Noct!<br />
Gladio: Hey, Noct!<br />
Prompto: Noct!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<div class="spdiv">[collapse]</div>

<p>[Noctis and the others make their way up the stairs from the parking lot area to the main thoroughfare]<br />
Noct: Dude, check it out!</p>
<p>[Noct looks up at the tower from the intro sequence; a cloaked figure stands near the top, preparing to take the Leap of Faith]<br />
Prompto: Oh em gee! Look at &#8217;em go!<br />
Gladio: What kinda crazy stunt is that?<br />
Ignis: The Leap of Faith—one of the Assassins&#8217; most astounding acrobatic feats.</p>
<p>[The cloaked figure takes the leap as the camera pulls back, revealing a wide shot of Lestallum]<br />
Prompto: You wanna do it, don&#8217;t you, Noct?<br />
[Note: The audio here has Prompto say &#8220;Ah, you wanna do it, don&#8217;t you, Noct?&#8221;]</p>
<p>[Still sitting on the wide shot of Lestallum, the Assassin&#8217;s Festival title card appears]<br />
Noct: I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about.<br />
Prompto: Oh, I think you do.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[As the friends proceed forward, Cindy suddenly shouts out to them; she&#8217;s standing with Holly]<br />
Cindy: Howdy, y&#8217;all!</p>
<p>[The Chocobros approach the two women]<br />
Prompto: H-hey, Cindy!</p>
<p>[Holly speaks to Cindy]<br />
Holly: Say, I didn&#8217;t realize you knew my favorite hunters.<br />
Cindy: They also happen to be my favorite customers.<br />
Gladio: And I take it you two are friends?<br />
Cindy: Me an&#8217; Holly? We&#8217;re bosom buddies.<br />
Gladio: So, can you tell me what this Assassin&#8217;s Festival thing is all about?</p>
<p>[Noct jumps in front of Gladio and begins explaining it to him]<br />
Noctis: Well, it all started a long time ago when this guy who eventually became the Assassin of legend—<br />
Gladio: I was asking her.</p>
<p>[Holly laughs]<br />
Holly: Simmer down, now. I&#8217;d be happy to tell you all about it. We&#8217;re also lending out costumes to the festivalgoers. Whether you wear them is up to you, but they&#8217;re perfect for the occasion!<br />
Prompto: Can we wear them, Noct? Can we can we can we?<br />
Ignis: They would certainly serve as an ideal disguise given the current state of the town.</p>
<p>[A prompt appears asking &#8220;What will you do?&#8221;; the player can select either &#8220;Wear my own robes&#8221; or &#8220;Rent robes with my friends&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Wear my own robes<br />
Noct: Actually, it just so happens I have my own costume right here.<br />
Gladio: Go figure.<br />
Prompto: What about us? Friends don&#8217;t let friends cosplay alone!</p>
<p>[The scene fades to black; when it fades back in, Noctis is wearing one of the Assassin&#8217;s Festival costumes; he tries out his costume&#8217;s hidden blade, then strikes a pose]<br />
Noct: Look at me—I&#8217;m a legendary Assassin!<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Rent robes with my friends<br />
Noct: Well, I guess I don&#8217;t have a choice, then.<br />
Prompto: Hah! As if you&#8217;d really say &#8220;no&#8221; to dressing up like an Assassin.</p>
<p>[Gladio rolls his eyes; the scene fades to black; when it fades back in, Noctis is wearing one of the Assassin&#8217;s Festival costumes; he tries out his costume&#8217;s hidden blade, then strikes a pose]<br />
Noct: Check it out, guys—I&#8217;m an Assassin!<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[The other three are looking over their outfits, which they&#8217;ve also changed into]<br />
Prompto: Wow, these look just like the real thing!<br />
Ignis: Is the real thing this revealing?<br />
Gladio: Is somebody shy?</p>
<p>[Ignis makes a &#8220;Pfft&#8221; sound]<br />
Ignis: No, it&#8217;s&#8230;simply a new sensation.</p>
<p>Holly has lent you a set of Medjay Assassin&#8217;s Robes.</p>
<p>You cannot change out of your robes during the festival.<br />
Talk to Holly to switch robes.</p>
<p>Holly: You boys sure wear those costumes well!<br />
Noct: I know.<br />
Cindy: Y&#8217;all are showin&#8217; me a whole &#8216;nother side of yourselves!<br />
Ignis: Not by choice; the outfits are revealing by design.<br />
Holly: They&#8217;re designed to help you get in the spirit. Now go out there and have fun!<br />
Gladio: Well, I&#8217;ll see you guys later. The ladies and I have got some catching up to do.<br />
Prompto: And what are we supposed to do?<br />
Noct: Check out the festival. C&#8217;mon!<br />
Prompto: B-b-but&#8230; Okay&#8230;<br />
Ignis: We&#8217;ll reconvene tonight at the Leville.<br />

Ask about the festival<br />
In a time past, the people of Lestallum suffered cruel tyranny at the hands of a merciless few for what seemed an eternity. Yet, as if in answer to the people&#8217;s prayers, there came a day from which the oppressors began to disappear, one after another, until at last only peace remained.</p>
<p>Knowing nothing of their hero, the people simply called him &#8220;the Assassin,&#8221; and committed his legacy to legend, which claimed that should terror ever befall the city again, the fabled savior would rise once more.</p>
<p>This celebration honors the nameless and faceless liberator of Lestallum.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Change outfits<br />
Holly: You really pull that look off! They both look great on you.<br />
&#8212;<br />

Holly: Need something?</p>
<p>[The same prompt and options as before appear]<br />

Prompto: Hey, Noct? I dunno if you saw it, but there&#8217;s this photo magazine at the prize counter&#8230;<br />
Noctis: Yeah, I saw it. And?<br />
Prompto: And I need it! Can I borrow some medals? Pleeease?<br />

<p>(a note on the shutter at the Coernix station)<br />
Thank you for visiting Coernix Station.<br />
Operations are suspended during the Assassin&#8217;s Festival.<br />
Sorry for the inconvenience.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing a conversation)<br />
Man (1): Did you ever wonder what your ancestors were like? I mean, for all we know, they could&#8217;ve been Assassins.<br />
Man (2): If they were, I bet I&#8217;m related to the legendary Assassin.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing another conversation)<br />
Girl: How come everyone&#8217;s dressed the same, Dad? It&#8217;s scary.<br />
Man: They&#8217;re costumes for the festival. They say it&#8217;s what the legendary Assassin used to wear.<br />
Girl: But if there&#8217;s a real Assassin here, you won&#8217;t be able to find him&#8230;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing another conversation)<br />
Woman: I just met this guy with a wicked cool eagle tattoo. Oh, you should have seen it!<br />
Man: You think he was a real Assassin?<br />
Woman: He looked more like a bodyguard. He even had a crazy scar!<br />
Man: Yikes. Sounds like trouble.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing yet another conversation)<br />
Man (1): Hey. Did you see that stylish blonde walking around town?<br />
Man (2): Did I? He&#8217;s cute and has a nice camera!<br />
Man (1): I know—I&#8217;m so jealous. I wanted to ask where he got it, but just can&#8217;t work up the nerve to talk to him.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing yet another conversation)<br />
Boy: The guy with the glasses kept staring at the people crossing the pipe! He didn&#8217;t even blink!<br />
Woman: Maybe he was just worried.<br />
Boy: No way! He had a fancy notebook and was taking notes on everything. Do you think he&#8217;s a spy?<br />
Woman: Then perhaps he&#8217;s researching the festival.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(and another still)<br />
Man (1): I heard they&#8217;re serving Galadhian food at the cafe. Wanna check it out?<br />
Man (2): Is that even a question? I live for Galadhian food!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing yet one more conversation)<br />
Man: I&#8217;m sweating rivers in this costume.<br />
Woman: Why don&#8217;t you just take off the hood?<br />
Man: You don&#8217;t get it. The hood is a symbol. It&#8217;s what makes the costume great! You&#8217;re not an Assassin without it.<br />
Woman: Uh-huh.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing an NPC)<br />
Man: Did you hear? Someone said they saw the prince and his retinue in town!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while walking around the outlook)<br />
Noctis: Something about this place feels&#8230;different.<br />
Prompto: That&#8217;s &#8217;cause it&#8217;s where the little kids play.<br />
Noctis: Then you must feel right at home.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(when walking into the area for the SQUARE ENIX Café)<br />
Prompto: They say these are all the rage in Galahd.<br />

Prompto: Then let&#8217;s go somewhere a little livelier!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(alternate dialogue for when walking around an area with no festivities)<br />
Noct: Geez, where&#8217;d all the people go?<br />
Prompto: To the heart of town where the action is.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring)<br />
Prompto: How come we don&#8217;t hold any festivals like this back home?<br />
Noctis: I can put it on my royal agenda.<br />
[Note: The audio here has Noct say &#8220;I&#8217;ll put it on my royal agenda&#8221;]<br />

<p>(while exploring)<br />
Prompto: How are you supposed to tell people apart when everyone looks the same?<br />

Noctis: No one&#8217;ll even know it&#8217;s me.<br />
Prompto: Yeah—as long as you don&#8217;t start warping around like crazy.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring)<br />
Prompto: Dinner tonight—what are we thinking?<br />
Noctis: Meh, something edible, I guess.<br />
Prompto: Really? You &#8220;guess&#8221;?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(when passing a cuddling couple while exploring)<br />
Prompto: Ugh&#8230; Why don&#8217;t they get a room?<br />
[Note: The audio here has Prompto say &#8220;Ew&#8221; rather than &#8220;Ugh&#8221;]<br />
Noctis: What? Is somebody jealous?<br />
Prompto: Me? Psh. I definitely don&#8217;t wish I were on a date with Cindy.<br />
Noctis: He doth protest too much, methinks.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(if the player tries to leave town)<br />
Prompto: Noooct, I wanna go back to the festival!<br />

Prompto: Whoa! What do you think they&#8217;re doing?</p>
<p>[Prompto and Noctis look up at two festivalgoers who are walking across pipes stretched between buildings]<br />
Noct: Some kind of contest?<br />
Prompto: All the way up there? Looks a little risky, don&#8217;t you think?<br />

Noct: Can&#8217;t say they wouldn&#8217;t, but let&#8217;s not give &#8217;em a chance to. C&#8217;mon.</p>
<p>Initiating a brawl will put Holly&#8217;s life in danger.<br />
Find a way to reach her without starting trouble.</p>
<p>Noctis will not immediately arouse suspicion while in costume.<br />
However, enemies will grow wary if he runs or jumps in front of them.<br />

<p>[As Noct and Prompto move away from the Leville, it becomes clear the alleyways are blocked by magitek troopers; Noct must point-warp to the top of a nearby building to get around them without raising alarm, then proceed across the rooftops]<br />
Prompto: It&#8217;s like they assassinated our plans of having fun at the festival.<br />
Noctis: And mark my words: I&#8217;m gonna make sure they pay for it.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the two friends continue making their way toward the power plant)<br />
Noctis: Heard anything from Ignis?<br />
Prompto: Yeah. They&#8217;ve got the Regalia surrounded.<br />
Noctis: Give me a break. First we get Holly, then the car.<br />
Prompto: Right. I&#8217;ll tell Iggy we&#8217;ll meet up with &#8217;em later.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[When Noctis and Prompto draw near the power plant, they can see Holly confronting Commander Loqi and numerous magitek troopers]<br />
Holly: If you think I&#8217;d let you leave that hunk of junk in my plant, you&#8217;d better think again. You can&#8217;t come in here and manhandle our power supply! It takes a woman&#8217;s touch.<br />
Loqi: Which is why we require your assistance.<br />
Holly: As if I would agree.</p>
<p>[Loqi chuckles]<br />
Loqi: Your position does not afford you the right to protest.<br />
Holly: Well, if you insist, have your men return my keycards. Can&#8217;t monitor the inner workings of the plant from the outside.<br />
Loqi: You will be permitted access as necessary. Follow my orders, and all will be well. We provide you with peace and yet still you rebel. It is high time you learned to show some gratitude—and to know your place as our lowly subjects.</p>
<p>[Loqi addresses his magitek troopers]<br />
Loqi: Take her away!<br />
Noctis: Let&#8217;s go after her!<br />
Prompto: No! We&#8217;d just be putting her in more danger.<br />
Noctis: Then what are we supposed to do?<br />
Prompto: I never said I had a better idea! But I did hear her say Loqi&#8217;s men stole her keycards. Maybe we could start by stealing them back.<br />
Noctis: Okay. Then let&#8217;s split up and take &#8217;em down.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[While on his way to retrieve a keycard, Noct is suddenly affected by a strange static that seems to fill the air; graphically, this static resembles the glitching effect seen within the Animus in the &#8220;Assassin&#8217;s Creed&#8221; series]<br />
Noctis: What the hell!?</p>
<p>[When Noct runs into a magitek trooper a moment later, he finds his weapons ineffective against the unit]</p>
<p>The empire has installed a jamming device at the plant, weakening Noctis and limiting his magical abilities.</p>
<p>Noctis: Nothing&#8217;s working on these guys! Damn. Time to turn tail!</p>
<p>[Noctis is forced to hide in a dumpster in order to loose the magitek troopers after him]<br />
Noctis: Should be safe here.</p>
<p>[The scene fades to black; when it fades back in, Noct emerges from the dumpster]<br />
Noctis: You okay?<br />
Prompto: Yeah, I think so. I&#8217;m worried about the others.<br />

<p>[Noct point-warps up to the balcony of the hotel room. Ignis and Gladio are waiting inside. After a brief fade to black, all four Chocobros, as well as Cindy, are in the hotel room discussing the situation. Noct and Cindy are sitting on one of the beds while the others stand]<br />
Noctis: &#8230;It was like my attacks just stopped working all of a sudden.<br />
Ignis: It sounds like they employed some sort of jamming device, one that prevents you unleashing your power to its full potential.<br />
Noctis: Great.<br />
Ignis: Our only option is to infiltrate the power plant and interrupt the empire&#8217;s interference.<br />
Gladiolus: Without the power of kings on our side?<br />
Prompto: But, who needs the power of kings&#8230;when you have the power of Assassins?<br />
Noctis: I get to be an Assassin? Well, if I have no other choice.<br />
Ignis: Then it&#8217;s settled. Our first order of business should be to gather a bit more intel. Noct, you and Prompto should scout out Loqi&#8217;s subordinates from the tower in front of the main thoroughfare.</p>
<p>[Cindy stands]<br />
Cindy: Is there anything I can do?<br />
Noctis: Nothing. I can&#8217;t put you in harm&#8217;s way.<br />

Ignis: Indeed.</p>

Assassin: Finally, a real Assassin.<br />
Noctis: &#8220;Finally&#8221;? Look around you—I&#8217;m hardly the only one.<br />
Assassin: Ah, but I have no business with those masquerading imposters. Even if you deny it, I can see you for what you really are.<br />
Noctis: Okay. So what business do you have with the &#8220;real&#8221; me?<br />
Assassin: I need you to take out some troopers. As for how you do it, everything is permitted.<br />
Noctis: Seems pretty dangerous, if you ask me. Why should I?<br />
Assassin: Nothing is true, so I have no answer—but there&#8217;s a reward.<br />
Noctis: Hmm&#8230; Well, I wouldn&#8217;t mind having more medallions. If you can manage that, I&#8217;ll take on the job.<br />
Assassin: A strange request&#8230; But if that is what you desire, then so be it. And with that, the contract is made.</p>
<p>A mysterious man has asked Noctis to put his Assassin skills to the test.</p>
<p>Some magitek troopers will drop broken magitek cores when subdued.<br />
Bring these back to the man to exchange them for medallions.<br />
The number of cores you have is visible at the right of the screen.</p>
<p>Rather than hunting down common troopers&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;try going after powerful troopers instead.</p>
<p>The man has issued a series of Assassin challenges.</p>
<p>Assassinate the troopers using the designated techniques,<br />
then report your success to the man for a reward.</p>

Prompto: You think?<br />
Noctis: I mean, who goes around saying, &#8220;nothing is true&#8221; and &#8220;everything is permitted&#8221;?<br />
Prompto: Maybe real Assassins do. I mean, you just said it too!<br />
Noctis: But actions speak louder than words. Guess it&#8217;s time to prove if I&#8217;m &#8220;really&#8221; an Assassin then.<br />

Prompto: They bring those troopers to life just to let &#8217;em die&#8230; It&#8217;s kinda sad, y&#8217;know?<br />

Woman: I wonder what the legendary Assassin was really like.<br />
Man: According to tales passed down in Lestallum, he was the strongest of &#8217;em all. He even wrote an entire codex about the ways of the Assassin.<br />
Woman: So did anyone ever find the book? I would love to take a look at it. Just imagine how much more we could learn about Assassins—about the world!<br />

Gladiolus: What do you think?</p>
<p>[Gladio begins walking toward the magitek trooper; he looks back over his shoulder and speaks to Noct once more]<br />
Gladiolus: Use that brain of yours. Go!</p>

Gladiolus: Hey, over here!</p>
<p>[The magitek trooper begins to follow after him]<br />
Noctis: H-hey! Just great.</p>
<p>[The MT gives up its pursuit after a moment and just stands looking in the direction Gladio has gone; Noct sneaks up on the imperial puppet in the meantime and skewers it]<br />
Noctis: Rest in peace.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[While making their way around assassinating the magitek troopers holding the keycards, Prompto and Noct come across Ignis]<br />
Ignis: Our target should be posted somewhere in the very back of the marketplace. The soldiers patrolling the area, however, will make procuring the keycard somewhat difficult.<br />
Noctis: But you have a plan, right?<br />
Ignis: Of sorts. I&#8217;ll watch from the rooftop and inform you of their movements.<br />
Noctis: Sounds good.<br />
Ignis: Just be careful not to get caught along the way.<br />
Noctis: I know.</p>
<p>[Ignis will then give Noct various instructions based on the situation at a given moment]<br />
Ignis: On your right, Noct!<br />
Ignis: Now!<br />

Ignis: Up ahead!<br />

Ignis: Hide!<br />

Prompto: I&#8217;m gonna lead all the people away from here. You&#8217;ll slip into the crowd and sneak up on the soldier.</p>
<p>[Prompto begins leading a group of other cloaked figures past the magitek trooper; Noct falls into the throng, and skewers the MT as he walks close to it]<br />

<p>[After Noct acquires the final keycard, the scene transitions back to the hotel room in the Leville; once again, the Chocobros and Cindy are all there; Noctis&#8217;s hood is down]<br />
Noct: So we got this on lock?<br />
Gladio: Not without the last keycard—and that one&#8217;s with Loqi.<br />
Ignis: Then we need to find him. Back to reconnaissance it is.<br />
Noct: I&#8217;m on it. But what do we do once we&#8217;ve got the card?<br />
Cindy: I&#8217;m gonna shut down that contraption.<br />
Prompto: You? All by yourself?<br />
Cindy: It ain&#8217;t my first time at the rodeo. I know my way around the plant and the gizmos inside. My best friend&#8217;s in trouble. I can&#8217;t just sit around twiddlin&#8217; my thumbs when I could be out there helpin&#8217; her.</p>

Loqi: They&#8217;ll show up eventually. After all, I&#8217;ve got what they&#8217;re looking for.</p>

Loqi: I haven&#8217;t forgotten the humiliating defeat I endured in Duscae. In the name of House Tummelt and the Niflheim Empire, I will have my revenge.</p>
<p>[In addition to the two magitek troopers accompanying Loqi, the alleyways are teeming with more]<br />
Noct: Ugh, these guys are everywhere.<br />
Prompto: Not over here. C&#8217;mon!</p>
<p>[Noct climbs the obstacles barricading a nearby alleyway, and proceeds after Loqi and his detail]<br />
Prompto: I bet they wouldn&#8217;t see you up there!</p>
<p>[Noct point-warps to a balcony above the next set of alleys and continues following Loqi from the vantage of the rooftops; Loqi speaks to his guards again]<br />
Loqi: The poor prince should be all but powerless now thanks to our jamming device. It would be a pity if he were to hurt himself, but&#8230;accidents do happen. Taking his life now would in turn save countless lives in the future.</p>
<p>[When Loqi nears the power plant, as in the DLC&#8217;s opening sequence, Noct leaps from atop the nearest building and performs an assassination maneuver on one of the magitek troopers; Loqi makes his way past a throng of magitek troopers on guard toward the bridge leading into the power plant; the two magitek troopers that have been guarding him up to now stop and stand with the others; when Loqi reaches the bridge in front of the power plant, he comes to a stop himself]<br />
Loqi: I&#8217;ll kill him myself. I will be the one to bring true peace to our world.</p>
<p>[Loqi then begins making his way alone down the alleyway running to the left of the bridge; numerous magitek troopers stand between him and Noctis&#8217;s position]<br />
Noct: I can&#8217;t let him get away!<br />
Prompto: And I can&#8217;t let myself hold you back. Go on without me. Good luck.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Noct point-warps to the top of the building to his left, climbs up, and then sneaks up on Loqi in the alleyway on the other side; as Noctis attempts to grab him, however, Loqi performs a spinning evasion maneuver and faces Noct]<br />
Loqi: Who are you?<br />
Noct: Your friendly neighborhood Assassin.</p>
<p>[Loqi chuckles a little]<br />
Loqi: Don&#8217;t make me laugh. Now! Kill him!</p>
<p>[Loqi turns and runs as one of his magitek troopers seemingly emerges from the ground, grabs Noctis, and begins electrocuting him; Noct breaks free after a moment and kills the magitek trooper, but more are already arriving, dropping in from above]<br />
Noct: You can&#8217;t escape! But you sure can run. Hey!</p>
<p>[As Noct pursues Loqi through the streets and alleyways, an announcement is broadcast]<br />
Broadcast: Attention: this is an emergency. All civilians should evacuate immediately.</p>
<p>[In addition to the magitek troopers zeroing in on Noctis as he chases after Loqi, an MA Veles magitek armor is dropped in at one point as well; shortly after the magitek armor&#8217;s arrival, Noctis realizes he has lost his quarry]<br />
Noct: Damn, I lost him.</p>
<p>[Continuing on, however, he catches sight of Loqi once more]<br />
Noct: Gotcha!</p>
<p>[Pursuing Loqi once more, Noct follows him down one more alleyway; Loqi soon runs into a dead end; here, he turns just in time to be tackled to the ground by Noctis, who remains on top of him as they fall]<br />
Noctis: I&#8217;ve got what I need. Now you need to get out of here.<br />
Loqi: Oh, spare me. Are you finished playing at Assassin yet, Your Highness?<br />
Noctis: You&#8217;re sharper than I thought.<br />
Loqi: Sharp enough to know you&#8217;d come for the keycard.</p>
<p>[Noct realizes someone is behind him and looks to see a multitude of magitek troopers have him cornered; Loqi grabs Noct and throws him off of him]<br />
Loqi: And now my men are coming for you.</p>
<p>[Both men stand]<br />
Loqi: Any last words?</p>
<p>[Loqi raises his hand]<br />
Loqi: Get him!<br />
Noctis: Shit&#8230; I&#8217;m trapped!</p>
<p>[A feather suddenly floats down by Noctis&#8217;s head; he turns and looks up]<br />
Noctis: Feathers?</p>
<p>[He then point-warps up toward the top of a rather high building above him to escape; there are already several magitek troopers here as well, however, and they immediately begin their attack; Noct runs]<br />
Noctis: I can&#8217;t let him get inside the power plant! Alright. Headin&#8217; back.</p>
<p>[Noct leaps from this building to a lower position and continues to run]<br />
Noctis: Which way did he go?</p>
<p>[Small missiles suddenly begin flying in from above, hitting the buildings all around Noctis]<br />
Noctis: They&#8217;re gonna level the whole city!</p>
<p>[An imperial drop ship flies overhead and releases more magitek troopers in Noct&#8217;s path]<br />
Noctis: Can&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m busy?</p>
<p>[Noctis continues making his break for the power plant as incoming missiles continue to fly and magitek troopers continue pursuing him; on one building, yet another group of magitek troopers already await his approach]<br />
Noctis: Give it a rest!</p>
<p>[As Noctis continues running across the rooftops, he comments on the situation again]<br />
Noctis: Bustin&#8217; out the big guns for little old me.</p>
<p>[As Noctis begins to point-warp from one building to another to escape the volleys of missiles headed for him, he spots a cable car making its way over the city]<br />
Noctis: Just in time!</p>
<p>[Noct point-warps to the cable car; a moment later, he hears a familiar voice shout out to him]<br />
Cindy: Over here!<br />
Noctis: Cindy?</p>
<p>[From his position on the side of the cable car, Noct can see Cindy, Prompto, Ignis and Gladio outside the power plant below; he point-warps down to ground level in front of them, and then faces Cindy]<br />
Noctis: This is it. You ready?<br />
Cindy: You bet. Let&#8217;s mosey!<br />
Ignis: And which of us will be providing backup?</p>
<p>[A prompt appears to select either Ignis, Gladiolus or Prompto]</p>

<p>Cindy: Well, keep an eye out for me, will ya?</p>
<p>[As Cindy and her escort head into the power plant, Noctis turns to find himself confronted by Loqi once again piloting a magitek armor, this time an MA Hoplomachus]<br />
Loqi: Requiescat in pace, Your Highness!</p>
<p>[Loqi cackles maniacally and begins firing an enormous flamethrower at Noctis and the others]<br />
Noctis: So much for having a fair fight.</p>
<p>[As the battle continues, Loqi issues a taunt]<br />
Loqi: Not so tough now, are you?</p>
<p>[A moment later, Loqi offers up another taunt]<br />
Loqi: Looks like you&#8217;re having a little trouble there.</p>
<p>[Following Loqi&#8217;s second taunt, one of three exchanges will follow, depending on who was sent with Cindy)</p>
<p>(if Gladio went with Cindy)<br />
Prompto: We can&#8217;t keep this up!<br />
Noctis: Not if Gladio and Cindy don&#8217;t get their asses in gear!<br />
Ignis: Patience! We only need to hold out a bit longer!</p>
<p>(if Ignis went with Cindy)<br />
Prompto: I can&#8217;t take this much longer!<br />
Gladio: We should&#8217;ve asked Iggy for a plan!<br />
Noctis: I&#8217;ve got one: don&#8217;t die!</p>
<p>(if Prompto went with Cindy)<br />
Gladio: We shouldn&#8217;t have sent him with her.<br />
Ignis: Have a little faith.<br />
Noctis: It may take him a while, but he always comes through in the end.</p>
<p>[Feeling assured of his victory, Loqi declares as much]<br />
Loqi: Today, I will have my revenge!</p>
<p>[At the same instant, however, the static in the air intensifies briefly, then disappears]<br />
Noctis: They did it!</p>
<p>[Noctis&#8217;s attacks begin damaging Loqi&#8217;s magitek armor]<br />
Loqi: The jamming device went offline! But how?<br />
Noctis: Maybe the Assassins decided to mess with you. Now it&#8217;s my turn.</p>
<p>[Noctis continues tearing into Loqi&#8217;s magitek armor until it is wrecked]<br />
Loqi: If I am fated to die here, then I&#8217;ll take you with me! Glory be to the Niflheim Empire!</p>
<p>[Loqi&#8217;s magitek armor explodes, seemingly finally killing him; the scene fades to black]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[The scene fades in on fireworks going off in the night sky over Lestallum; the Chocobros, Holly and Cindy are gathered in the parking area]<br />
Cindy: Thanks, boys. You really saved the day!<br />
Noct: Least we could do after getting you involved in all this. You&#8217;re the real hero. We couldn&#8217;t have done it without you.<br />
Cindy: Shucks, it was nothin&#8217;. I&#8217;m just glad Holly made it back right as rain.<br />
Gladio: Word on the street is the Assassins are the ones who sent the empire packing.<br />
Ignis: That &#8220;word&#8221; should save us a world of hassle.<br />
Prompto: I can see the headlines: &#8220;The Assassins are out there!&#8221; Man, at this point, even I want to believe.<br />
Noct: Why believe anything if nothing is real? And why not chase every desire you have if everything is allowed? As we say in the Brotherhood, &#8220;Nothing is true; everything is permitted.&#8221;<br />
Prompto: &#8220;We&#8221;? I think all that cosplay has gone to your head.</p>
<p>[They all look up at the fireworks, which now include a design in the shape of the &#8220;Assasin&#8217;s Creed&#8221; logo]<br />
Noct: Maybe so. But my time as an Assassin taught me to take pride in doing good deeds—even if they go unseen.</p>
<p>[The camera then transitions to a cloaked figure standing atop a cable car platform high above the city; the figure dives over the edge and vanishes as an eagle flies by and releases a screech; fade to black]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Following the credits, two notifications then appear]<br />
Congratulations—you have saved the Assassin&#8217;s Festival!<br />
Enjoy the festivities, and watch out for imperial soldiers.</p>
<p>As a token of her thanks, Holly has given you a set of Medjay Assassin&#8217;s Robes.<br />
Speak to her to change into them for the festival, or wear them in the main game.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[The screen fades from black to Noctis and Prompto back in the parking area; a series of notifications now appear]<br />
A new reward is available at the prize counter.</p>
<p>The chocobo racetrack is now open.</p>
<p>The Assassin&#8217;s treasure hunt has begun.</p>
<p>Thanks for playing, and enjoy the Assassin&#8217;s Festival!</p>

(quest description for &#8220;Party Like an Assassin&#8221;)<br />
The empire has been run out of Lestallum, and the festival-goers are finally free to have fun without fear of an imperial assault. Don your Assassin&#8217;s robes and enjoy the festivities!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Holly)<br />
Holly: I can&#8217;t thank you enough, Mister Hunter.</p>
<p>[The same prompt and options as before appear]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Holly again)<br />
Holly: Hope you enjoy the festival!</p>
<p>[The same prompt and options as before appear]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Cindy)<br />
Cindy: Now we ain&#8217;t got nothin&#8217; to worry &#8217;bout but havin&#8217; fun!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(when taking the Leap of Faith again)<br />
Noct: Did you get a good shot!?<br />
Prompto: Uh, nope.</p>
<p>[Noct groans in frustration]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Ignis)<br />
Noctis: So, you gonna take that walk or what?<br />
Ignis: As it were&#8230;I already did.<br />
Noctis: Why didn&#8217;t you say something?<br />
Ignis: Didn&#8217;t want to distract with my sideshow-of-sorts. My apologies.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Ignis once more)<br />
Ignis: It would appear the key is finding your center of balance.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Gladio after coming across him talking to a woman outside the Leville)<br />
Gladio: What&#8217;re you doing here?<br />
Woman: Who&#8217;s Mr. Tall-Dark-and-Handsome?<br />
Gladio: Him? Just a buddy of mine.<br />
Woman: Hunks of a feather really do flock together.<br />
Noct: What did I get myself into?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Gladio again)<br />
Gladio: Can&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m busy here?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after walking away from Gladio and the woman)<br />
Noct: Gladio is really something else.<br />
Prompto: I could never be like him.<br />
Noct: I&#8217;d never want to.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(coming across Gladio talking to another woman in one of the alleyways)<br />
Prompto: Now he&#8217;s flirting with another girl!</p>
<p>[Gladio continues speaking to the woman without giving any acknowledgement to Prompto and Noctis]<br />
Gladio: I asked some guy for directions, but I ended up getting turned right back around. Sorry for the trouble.<br />
Woman: No trouble at all! This place is like a maze.<br />
Gladio: Well, I may have lost my way, but I found something even better: you.<br />
Woman: Aren&#8217;t you the smooth talker! I bet you use that line on all the girls.<br />
Gladio: Only the pretty ones.</p>
<p>[The woman sighs with an air of delight in her voice]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Gladio while he&#8217;s talking to this second woman)<br />
Gladiolus: You kids run along and play.<br />
[Note: The audio here has Gladio say &#8220;Yeah, you kids run along and play.&#8221;]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after walking away from Gladio and this second woman)<br />
Prompto: I am disgusted.<br />
Noct: You and me both.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after purchasing the Magitek Wrench at the prize counter)<br />
Prompto: You should offer that as a tribute to Our Goddess.</p>
<p>[A prompt appears asking &#8220;Who will you give it to?&#8221;; the player can select either &#8220;Prompto&#8221; or &#8220;Cindy&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Prompto<br />
Noct: No—you take it.<br />
Prompto: You sure about this, Noct?<br />
Noct: Why shouldn&#8217;t I be? She&#8217;s your &#8220;goddess&#8221; after all. Give it to her and ask her for a picture.<br />
Prompto: Well, I mean, if you&#8217;re absolutely sure—<br />
Noct: I am. So get on with it, will you?<br />
Prompto: Okay. Thanks so much, Noct. I owe you one! It&#8217;s gonna be my greatest picture yet. You&#8217;ll see!</p>
<p>[The screen briefly fades to black; as it fades back in, Prompto is walking up to Noctis, having returned from seeing Cindy; Noct chuckles]<br />
Noct: I guess that means things went well.</p>
<p>[The player looks at the picture]<br />
Noct: Kinda glad I wasn&#8217;t.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Cindy<br />
Noct: Right. It&#8217;s no use in our hands anyway.<br />
Prompto: I can&#8217;t wait to see her smiling face!</p>
<p>(when speaking with Cindy)<br />
[A prompt appears asking &#8220;What will you do?&#8221;; the player can select either &#8220;Give her a present&#8221; or &#8220;Make conversation&#8221;]</p>
<p>(upon selecting &#8220;Give her a present&#8221;)<br />
Noct: Hey. I found this earlier. I don&#8217;t know if you need one, but if you want it, it&#8217;s yours.<br />
Cindy: A gift? For me? These are mighty hard to come by, y&#8217;know. I was startin&#8217; to think they were the stuff of legends. I&#8217;d be glad to take it off your hands, but is there anything I can do to repay you?<br />
Noct: Well, if you insist, I&#8217;ll trade it for a photo with you.<br />
Cindy: I&#8217;d hardly call that a trade, but you got yourself a deal.</p>
<p>[The screen fades to black and Prompto&#8217;s deflated voice can then be heard as he prepares to take the picture]<br />
Prompto: Say &#8220;cheese&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>[The camera shutter clicks; after the player examines the picture, the scene fades back in near the photo stand-in]<br />
Prompto: No fair. I wanted to take a picture with Cindy, too. Where can we get more of those wrenches?<br />
[Note: The audio here has Prompto say &#8220;Where can we get some more of those wrenches?&#8221;]<br />
Noct: Don&#8217;t need a wrench to ask her for a picture.<br />
Prompto: If only it were that easy, Noct&#8230;<br />

<h3>Incidental conversations from Episode Duscae and the main game</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>• Episode Duscae</strong></span><br />
(as an imperial drop ship arrives)<br />
Ignis: MTs.<br />
Prompto: Why do you call &#8217;em that?<br />
Noctis: Magitek troops. Empty inside.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring)<br />
Noctis: Gas stations are the same wherever you go.<br />
Gladiolus: That one looks more like the gas station that time forgot.<br />
Ignis: Would look a tad out of place in the crown city.<br />
Prompto: Gotta love that smell though, right?</p>
<p>[Note: This exchange also appears in &#8220;Final Fantasy XV: Pocket Edition,&#8221; with Ignis&#8217;s line rendered as &#8220;Would look a tad out of place in the Crown City.&#8221;]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring)<br />
Gladiolus: Let&#8217;s go grab something that sticks to your ribs.<br />
Ignis: &#8220;Nutrition,&#8221; gentlemen. His Highness could certainly do with some green in his diet.<br />
Noctis: We&#8217;ll see about that.<br />
Prompto: First let&#8217;s see if we can score some spicy food.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring)<br />
Gladiolus: Ooooooh.<br />
[Note: The audio here makes clear that this is a painful grunt]<br />
Noctis: Feeling your age?<br />
Gladiolus: You&#8217;ll know how it feels in five years.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring)<br />
Ignis: I could do with a bath.<br />
Gladiolus: Well, about time we found a place to hole up.<br />
Prompto: Oh yeah, we better. Wouldn&#8217;t want Ignis to feel &#8220;unkempt.&#8221;<br />
Ignis: You take pride in your poor hygiene?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring)<br />
Prompto: Whole lotta land out there.<br />
Noctis: Bet we could cover it quicker with some chocobos.<br />
Prompto: It would sure beat the hell out of walking.</p>
<p>[Note: This exchange also appears in &#8220;Final Fantasy XV: Pocket Edition&#8221;]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring)<br />
Gladiolus: No doubt about it: &#8220;chunky&#8221; is the only way to go.<br />
Noctis: No. &#8220;Smooth&#8221; is so much better.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring)<br />
Gladiolus: Amazing how free we are out here.<br />
[Note: The audio here first has Prompto say &#8220;Yep&#8221;]<br />
Prompto: Far cry from life back home.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring at night)<br />
Gladiolus: Whoa, look up! Check it out.<br />
Noctis: Hm? Aaah.<br />
[Note: The audio here has Prompto first say &#8220;Yeah&#8221;]<br />
Prompto: Ever see so many stars?<br />
Ignis: Not over the crown city, to be sure.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring at night)<br />
[Note: The audio here first has Prompto say &#8220;Hmm&#8221;]<br />
Prompto: Real quiet out here, far removed from the hustle and bustle of the crown city.<br />
Noctis: That&#8217;s what makes it hard to stay awake.</p>
<p>[Note: This exchange also appears in &#8220;Final Fantasy XV: Pocket Edition,&#8221; with Prompto&#8217;s line rendered as &#8220;Hm, real quiet out here. Far removed from the hustle and bustle of the Crown City.&#8221;]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>Prompto: Couldn&#8217;t sleep at all last night, but then I had the weirdest dream.<br />
Noctis: Never knew you to be a dreamer.<br />
Prompto: Always wake up before I can remember anything.<br />
Noctis: What I wouldn&#8217;t give for that.<br />
Prompto: You are a pretty deep sleeper&#8230;like under the ground deep.</p>
<p>[Note: This exchange also appears in &#8220;Final Fantasy XV: Pocket Edition,&#8221; with Prompto&#8217;s second line rendered as &#8220;You are a pretty deep sleeper&#8230;like under-the-ground deep.&#8221;]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>Noctis: I remember thinking afternoons were the worst.<br />
Prompto: That&#8217;s life in the crown city, waiting for the night to set you free.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>• Main game</strong></span><br />
(while exploring)<br />
Prompto: You reckon Cindy&#8217;s taken?<br />
Gladiolus: Don&#8217;t think so.<br />
Noctis: And you&#8217;d know.<br />
Gladiolus: Not exactly hard to tell. A guard like hers doesn&#8217;t come down easily.<br />
Prompto: Even to a Casanova like you?<br />
Gladiolus: Curious as I am to see, my priority&#8217;s keeping His Highness safe.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring)<br />
Ignis: You look a bit out of sorts, Noct.<br />
Gladiolus: You need to take better care of yourself.<br />
Noctis: Thought that&#8217;s what you two were for.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after a random battle)<br />
Prompto: It just occurred to me, but this is totally like King&#8217;s Knight.<br />
Noctis: Huh?<br />
Prompto: There&#8217;s four of us, just like in the game!<br />
Noctis: Well, then I gotta be a <em>five</em>-star character.<br />
Gladiolus: Hell no. If anyone here&#8217;s a &#8220;Rare,&#8221; it&#8217;s me.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring)<br />
Prompto: Oh, right—King&#8217;s Knight! I bet my Zell tree&#8217;s almost full.<br />
Noctis: Damn, I forgot to harvest!<br />
Prompto: Man, wouldn&#8217;t it be great if money grew on trees in real life?<br />
Noctis: Sure would be. Maybe there&#8217;s one out there.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(entering a random battle)<br />
Ignis: Any plan of attack?<br />
Noctis: Plow right through &#8217;em.<br />
Ignis: I&#8217;ll circle around then.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(entering a random battle)<br />
Ignis: Let me give the orders this time.<br />
Noct: Just keep it short.<br />
Prompto: And simple.<br />
Ignis: &#8230;Attack.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(entering a random battle)<br />
Gladio: A big weapon like that&#8217;ll leave you wide open. Try another.<br />
Noctis: Ever thought about taking your own advice?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(during a random battle)<br />
Ignis: Let nothing stand in your way.<br />
Noctis: You&#8217;ve got my back?<br />
Ignis: Always.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(entering a random battle with daemons)<br />
Gladiolus: UGH. Ugliest things I&#8217;ve ever seen.<br />
Noctis: I don&#8217;t wanna go anywhere near &#8217;em.<br />
Prompto: Ha! I don&#8217;t even wanna look at &#8217;em!<br />
Ignis: Hmph. I feel the same about you lot.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(when entering battle with either a tonberry, master tonberry or sir tonberry)<br />
Prompto: He&#8217;s got a knife! Maybe it&#8217;s for cooking?<br />
Gladio: Don&#8217;t bet on it.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(when entering battle with either a tonberry, master tonberry or sir tonberry)<br />
Ignis: A kitchen knife&#8230; Wonder if it&#8217;s a culinary battle he wants.<br />
Noctis: I somehow doubt that.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as an imperial drop ship arrives)<br />
Ignis: MTs!<br />
Prompto: Time to cut and run?<br />
Noctis: Time to cut and cut.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon Gladiolus being petrified during battle)<br />
Ignis: Gladio&#8217;s hard as a rock.<br />
Noctis: The hell are you talking about!?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon Prompto being turned into a frog during battle)<br />
Ignis: Seems Prompto&#8217;s turned into a frog.<br />
Noctis: Again?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon Prompto recovering from Confusion status)<br />
Prompto: Boy, am I glad to have my voice back!<br />
Noctis: I kinda liked the quiet.<br />
Prompto: Heyyy!<br />
Noctis: Lighten up.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while stopping at a gas station)<br />
Gladio: Hey, I&#8217;m gonna hit the shop.<br />
Prompto: Yeah, let&#8217;s stock up on everything!<br />
Ignis: We can make room by leaving you behind.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon returning to the surface from a dungeon)<br />
Prompto: Smell that fresh air—makes you feel alive!<br />
Noct: Yeah, don&#8217;t get used to it.<br />
Gladiolus: Why is everything such a big deal with you?<br />
Ignis: Let him have his fun, while he&#8217;s still alive.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after a random battle)<br />
Prompto: Wonder if I&#8217;ll ever get the hang of all this fighting.<br />
Gladio: Sure you will, if you live long enough.<br />
Ignis: I wouldn&#8217;t count on that myself.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after Ignis uses Sagefire on an enemy during a battle)<br />
Noctis: You always come through.<br />
[Ignis makes a &#8220;Hm&#8221; sound]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(during a random battle)<br />
Prompto: Knock &#8217;em dead, Noct! I&#8217;ll be sure to get lots of pics!<br />
Noctis: How about you fight instead?<br />
Prompto: Nah, I think I&#8217;m okay!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after Prompto uses Piercer on an enemy fighting Gladio)<br />
Gladiolus: Knew you weren&#8217;t completely useless!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(during a random battle)<br />
Ignis: Is Prompto alright?<br />
Gladiolus: He&#8217;s a big boy—he&#8217;ll be fine.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(during a random battle)<br />
Gladiolus: You&#8217;ve come a long way, Prompto.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(during a random battle)<br />
Ignis: Impressive, Noct. You&#8217;ve grown stronger.<br />
Noctis: Must be thanks to my balanced diet.<br />
Ignis: The one that excludes vegetables?<br />
Noctis: Yep, that&#8217;s the one.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(during a random battle)<br />
Prompto: Don&#8217;t you feel any jitters here on the front lines, Noct?<br />
Noctis: Nah, I leave the worrying to you.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(during a random battle)<br />
Ignis: It&#8217;s an eat-or-be-eaten world.<br />
Noct: I say &#8220;eat.&#8221;<br />
Ignis: Then let&#8217;s dig in, shall we?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(during a random battle)<br />
Gladio: Pull it together, Prompto! Wouldn&#8217;t want to make a fool of yourself with Cindy watching.<br />
Prompto: C-Cindy!? Where?<br />
Noct: Gimme a break.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(during a battle with Treant-type enemies)<br />
Prompto: Those plants seem to have legs.<br />
Ignis: And they&#8217;re legging it towards us.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(entering a battle with a coeurl)<br />
Ignis: The coeurl acquires charge from particles in the air. If you see it seated on its haunches, stay back.<br />
[Note: The audio here has Ignis say &#8220;The coeurl acquires charge from the particles in the air&#8221;]<br />
Prompto: And what if we don&#8217;t?<br />
Ignis: You die.<br />
Prompto: Me-owch! That is one ferocious feline.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after a battle with chickatrice or regaltrice enemies)<br />
Prompto: Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but I feel kinda bad taking those things down.<br />
Ignis: You&#8217;re not alone, but out in the wild it&#8217;s kill-or-be-killed.<br />
Noct: And personally, I&#8217;d prefer the former.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after a random battle while Iris is a guest party member)<br />
Iris: You guys kick ass.<br />
Prompto: You mean it?<br />
Iris: Yeah! You look cool doing it too.<br />
Prompto: Yeah, we get that a lot.<br />
Gladiolus: Don&#8217;t take it to heart.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after Iris performs Eclipse during a battle where she is a guest party member)<br />
Noctis: Damn, Iris—didn&#8217;t know you had it in ya.<br />
Iris: Never underestimate an Amicitia.<br />
Noctis: Lesson learned.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after Iris performs Eclipse during a battle where she is a guest party member)<br />
Prompto: You two are a couple of beasts!<br />
Gladio: Sure are.<br />
Iris: Speak for yourself.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(Ignis bringing Gladiolus back from the brink during a battle)<br />
Ignis: We&#8217;ve no one to protect the king with his shield out of commission.<br />
Gladiolus: And since when is there a king worthy of my protection?<br />
Noctis: You say something?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(Ignis bringing Noctis back from the brink during a battle)<br />
Ignis: Feeling alright?<br />
Noctis: I&#8217;ve had worse near-death experiences.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(Noctis bringing Ignis back from the brink during a battle)<br />
Noctis: You can&#8217;t die. You&#8217;ve got hungry mouths to feed.<br />
Ignis: Yours, namely?<br />
Noctis: Yeah, for one.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(Prompto bringing Ignis back from the brink during a battle)<br />
Prompto: Wouldn&#8217;t be the same without you, Ignis.<br />
Ignis: Thank you.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(Prompto bringing Gladiolus back from the brink during a battle)<br />
Prompto: Guuuh! Gladio! No no no! Don&#8217;t even think about dying!<br />
Gladiolus: <em>You</em> are worried about <em>me</em??

(Ignis bringing Aranea back from the brink during a battle where she has shown up to help)
Ignis: Are you hurt?
Aranea: You always this kind to enemies?
Ignis: No, but I am to my allies.
[Aranea gasps a little, then sighs and chuckles]

(during a random battle where Aranea has shown up to help)
Gladiolus: You really know how to work a lance.
Aranea: I'm not touchin' that.

(while exploring after having cooked freshly caught fish at camp the previous evening)
Prompto: I can't get over last night's fish. So flaky and moist...
Ignis: The freshness made all the difference.
Noctis: That settles it: more fishing!
Prompto: If only you had the same passion for other things.
---

(while exploring)
Prompto: Dude, what you cooked the other day? That was really good.
Ignis: Ah, yes. I used Galdin sea salt, which boasts unique properties. Its mineral composition closely resembles—are you listening?
Prompto: Uh...yeah! Yeah, salt! Love the stuff.
Gladio: How did you manage to graduate?
---

(overhearing a conversation in Takka's Pit Stop)
Man (1): If you're hankerin' to see the Disc, you can't beat the outlook at Lestallum.
Man (2): That's all well an' good, but first we need to get there. It ain't exactly up the road.
---

(when some daemons emerge while driving at night)
Gladiolus: More daemons!
Noct: That time already?
Gladiolus: I'm not in the mood for these horror film rejects.
---

(coming up on an outpost while driving as the sun is setting)
Prompto: Hey, Noct. Why don't we sleep there?
Noctis: They got somethin' special?
Prompto: A safe place to spend the night? The daemons'll be coming out any minute!

[A prompt appears to select either "Call it a night" or "Keep going"]

(upon selecting "Keep going")
Noct: As long as we keep moving, we'll be fine.
Prompto: But how can you be sure?
Gladiolus: What—the monsters got you scared?
Prompto: Nah. Monsters don't scare me. I ride with one every day.
Gladiolus: You wanna run that by me again?
---

(while exploring as darkness falls)
Prompto: Illuminate!
Noctis: You're such a nerd.
---

(while exploring)
Prompto: Woke up on the wrong side of the bed again, huh?
Gladiolus: Well, a cup of Ebony will wake him up.
Ignis: We mustn't deplete the stock!
Gladiolus: You really love that stuff, don't you.
---

(while exploring)
Noctis: I might have asked before, but is Ebony really all that good?
Ignis: I might have answered before, but yes, it is.
---

(while exploring)
Prompto: Hey! You remember what you wanted to be growing up, Ignis?
Ignis: My childhood aspirations? Hmm...
Prompto: No need to, uh, go into depth, really...
---

Noct: Can't forget the skewers we had in Lestallum.
Ignis: Ah, yes. We must return for more.
Prompto: What? I didn't think you were into street food.
Ignis: Tasty, cheap, convenient—what's not to like?
---

(while exploring)
Prompto: You're startin' to get the hang of it.
Noctis: The hang of what?
Prompto: You know, looking after yourself, being one of the common folk.
Noctis: Well, in a lot of ways it's easier than being royalty.
---

(after a random battle)
Noctis: I could go for a bite.
Gladiolus: Wanna set up camp?
Prompto: Aw, can't we stay a hotel instead?
Ignis: If you're willing to pay for one.
---

(during a random battle in a dungeon)
Ignis: Not good to throw daggers in the dark.
Noctis: Be nice to brighten things up in here.
---

(alternate version of the previous exchange)
Ignis: Not good to throw daggers in the dark.
Prompto: Now imagine you were using a gun.
---

(while exploring near the Chocobo Post)
Prompto: Y'know how chocobos smell really bad, but it's like a good kind of bad smell?
Gladiolus: If you really feel that way, they could probably use you in the stables.
---

(while exploring near the Chocobo Post)
Ignis: You'll observe the eccentric behavior.
Gladio: I'm sensing some aggression.
Noct: The chocobos, right?
---

(while exploring)
Prompto: Ah, sweet chocobos. You always set my soul at ease.
Noctis: Never realized you were so into chocobos.
Prompto: I'm toootally into chocobos. ...Don't take that the wrong way.
Noctis: There's no wrong way to love a chocobo.
---

(while parking the Regalia)
Prompto: Old girl could really use a car wash.
Ignis: Then we'd best stop at the nearest petrol station.
---

(taking flight in the Regalia Type-F for the first time)
Gladiolus: Whoa, this is awesome!
Ignis: Taking the high road.
Noctis: Where we're going, we don't need roads.
---

(as Noctis casts his fishing line)
Prompto: I wonder if His Majesty fished as well.
Noctis: Don't think so, far as I know.
---

(when leaving Galdin Quay)
Gladiolus: The eats at the quay left me with a hankering for seafood.
Ignis: The shoreline's always a sure bet. Won't find fresher fish elsewhere.
---

(while exploring either Galdin Quay or Altissia)
Prompto: Wow, this place is so romantic.
Gladiolus: And you get to enjoy it with us.
Noctis: All three of us.
Ignis: You are a lucky man.
---

(while perusing Prompto's photos at camp and passing one of Noctis getting hurt in battle)
Gladiolus: Roughed up pretty good there.
Ignis: You're lucky to survive that.
Noct: Yeah, what with Prompto busy with the camera.
---

(while perusing Prompto's photos at camp and coming across one of him taking a selfie)
Noctis: I swear, half of your photos are selfies.
Prompto: Hashtag "sorry not sorry."
---

(while perusing Prompto's photos at camp)
Ignis: Well taken.
Prompto: Maybe I could make a living out of this.
---

(while perusing Prompto's photos at camp)
Noctis: Nice shot, Prompto.
Prompto: Maybe I could make a living out of this.
---

(coming across a photo of Gladiolus with Cindy or Aranea while perusing Prompto's photos at camp)
Noctis: Gettin' a little cozy, aren't we?
Gladiolus: What? This is normal.
Prompto: It should have been meeeeee!
---

(coming across a photo of an imperial trooper or magitek armor taken during battle while perusing Prompto's photos at camp)
Ignis: An unsettling place, the empire.
---

(the first time Gentiana appears in one of Prompto's photos)
Noctis: Isn't this Gentiana?
Gladiolus: Yeah. She was here, huh?
Prompto: She was.
Ignis: The photo would suggest so.
Prompto: I guess. Memory must be playing tricks.
---

(the second time Gentiana appears in one of Prompto's photos)
Noctis: Huh, Gentiana again.
Gladio: What? When was she here?
Prompto: She wasn't. This time I'm sure of it.
Ignis: The plot thickens.
---

(the third time Gentiana appears in one of Prompto's photos)
Noctis: Gentiana's back.
---

(while exploring)
Prompto: Ahhh, the breeze feels good!
Ignis: Indeed.
---

(while exploring)
Ignis: Rather sultry.
Noctis: Yeah.
---

(as strong winds begin to blow while exploring)
Noctis: Wind's picked up.
Prompto: Storm's gonna ruin my hair.
Ignis: I'm not sure whether it's a storm front or just the terrain.
Gladio: Yeah, just worry about your stuff blowin' away.
---

(while exploring when it's especially windy)
Noctis: Damn, this wind's strong.
Prompto: Nooo, my perfectly groomed hair!
Noctis: Think you got it bad? Check out Ignis.
Prompto: Whoa, you're right.
Ignis: It's rude to stare.
---

(as rain begins to fall while exploring)
Gladiolus: Sky's opening up.
---

(as rain begins to fall while exploring)
Prompto: I felt a drop!
Ignis: Bit of precipitation.
---

(as rain begins to fall while exploring)
Prompto: Starting to come down.
Noct: Ugh, perfect.
Gladio: A little rain never hurt anybody.
Prompto: Makes me feel like a kid again.
Noctis: You haven't changed much.
---

(while exploring in the rain)
Ignis: A dreary day.
Noct: Yeah.
---

(while exploring in the rain)
Prompto: What if the rain out here is poisonous?
Ignis: If it were, I imagine we'd know by now.
Prompto: Well, you can never be too safe outside the city walls.
---

(while exploring in the rain)
Ignis: Hmmm...
Gladio: What?
Ignis: The distance disappears on a rainy night.
Noct: Can you see what's right in front of us?
Ignis: More or less.
---

(as the rain ends)
Gladio: Finally cleared up?
Ignis: Familiar and fair is the scent of fresh rain.
Gladio: Yeah, I like it, too.
---

(while exploring)
Noctis: What's the forecast?
Ignis: Clear skies, with the temperature rising.
Noctis: Nice.
