<h1>A FINAL FANTASY for Fans and First-Timers</h1>
<p>[Beginning a new game at the title screen]</p>
<h1>FINAL FANTASY XV</h1>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">In a time unknown, only a prophecy keeps hope alive in people&#8217;s hearts: &#8220;When darkness veils the world, the King of Light shall come.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 20px;">Now, four brave warriors begin their journey, prepared to fight. What awaits the four, however, they do not know.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<h2>The Tale of the Chosen King,<br />
Savior to the Star</h2>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>[The scene fades in from black to Noctis Lucis Caelum dressed in the Kingly Raiment, &#8220;the clothing of the Chosen King&#8221; as it&#8217;s described; his face illuminated by flames, he wipes sweat from his brow with the back of his sleeve; he&#8217;s grunting from the intense heat sweltering around him; after a moment longer, he charges forward to face the demonic-looking Ifrit, who sits upon a throne of bones looking bored; other young men are already attacking the god of fire; as Noctis nears Ifrit, a pillar of flame erupts from the air in front of the fiery entity, enveloping Noctis; the royal protagonist is launched away, landing on his back with sections of his clothing on fire; Noctis&#8217;s friend, Prompto Argentum, gets down on his knees beside Noctis, and quickly pats out the flames with his hands]</p>
<p>[Note: The audio here has Prompto say &#8220;Noct! Hang in there, buddy!&#8221; at this point]<br />
Prompto: Stay down. We&#8217;ll keep him busy.</p>
<p>[Prompto rejoins the battle; Noctis gets back to his feet; once he does so, another voice calls out to him: that of another close friend and retainer, Ignis Scientia, who is kneeling behind cover near Ifrit&#8217;s throne]<br />
Ignis: Noct! Over here!</p>
<p>[Noctis begins to go toward Ignis, but is moving slowly due to his wounds]<br />
Ignis: Quickly, before he strikes again!</p>
<p>[Suddenly, Noctis is tackled from behind by a third friend &#8212; self-appointed Shield of the King, Gladiolus Amicitia &#8212; and pulled into cover where Ignis is; Prompto joins the other three within a second]<br />
Prompto: Here it comes!</p>
<p>[Another pillar of flame from Ifrit washes around the four as they huddle together and use their cover for protection; when the flames pass, Prompto and Gladiolus immediately break from cover and charge at Ifrit]</p>
<p>[Note: The audio here has Prompto say &#8220;Got your back!&#8221; as they go]</p>
<p>[Ignis stands and holds out a curative item to heal Noctis]</p>
<p>[Note: The audio here has Ignis say &#8220;Here you go&#8221;]</p>
<p>[The heir to the throne of Lucis rises once more and continues the charge alongside his friends]<br />
Noctis: Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<p>[The screen fades out to white]</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Before the Fall&#8230;</strong></span><br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[An establishing shot of Insomnia is shown; the Wall that has protected the city for generations shimmers across the cityscape; the scene cuts to the throne room of the Citadel; a younger Noctis, Prompto, Ignis and Gladiolus stand before King Regis &#8212; Noctis&#8217;s father]<br />
Regis: The decreed hour is come. Set forth with my blessing, Prince Noctis.</p>
<p>[Noctis bows]<br />
Noctis: Thank you&#8230; Your Majesty.<br />
Regis: Take your leave, and go in the grace of the gods.</p>
<p>[Noctis straightens back up]<br />
Noctis: Right.</p>
<p>[Noctis turns and walks past his friends, who look startled; confused, they quickly turn back to the king and bow before setting off after Noctis; Regis looks unhappy with the proceedings; the scene transitions to the steps of the Citadel; Noctis and the others are descending toward a car where Cor Leonis stands awaiting them]<br />
Prompto: Well, princes will be princes.<br />
Ignis: So much for royal protocol.<br />
Gladiolus: Not like you had to deliver a formal address&#8230;</p>
<p>[A voice suddenly calls out from behind them]<br />
Drautos: Your Highness!</p>
<p>[Noctis stops and turns; his father is at the top of the steps, accompanied by Captain Drautos; despite his braced leg and dependence on a walking stick, Regis begins descending the steps to catch up to Noctis]<br />
Noctis: What now?</p>
<p>[Noctis walks back up some steps to meet his dad halfway]<br />
Regis: I fear I have left too much unsaid. You place a great burden on those who would bear with you.<br />
Noctis: You&#8217;re one to talk.</p>
<p>[Regis looks at Noctis&#8217;s friends and begins to address them]<br />
Regis: I ask not that you guide my wayward son, merely that you remain at his side.</p>
<p>[Ignis bows]<br />
Ignis: Indeed, Your Grace.<br />
Gladiolus: We&#8217;ll see the prince to Altissia if it&#8217;s the last thing we see.<br />
Prompto: Yeah, what he said.<br />
Noctis: Hate to break this up, but Cor&#8217;s got the motor running.</p>
<p>[Noctis begins walking away]<br />
Noctis: Drautos, he&#8217;s in your hands.<br />
Regis: And another thing.</p>
<p>[Noctis stops once more and turns]<br />
Regis: Do mind your manners around your charming bride-to-be.</p>
<p>[Noctis walks back to Regis and bows with a deliberately exaggerated flourish]<br />
Noctis: Your Majesty, as well. Try to mind yours around our esteemed guests from Niflheim.<br />
Regis: You have no cause for concern.<br />
Noctis: Nor do you.<br />
Regis: Take heed. Once you set forth, you cannot turn back.<br />
Noctis: You think I would?<br />
Regis: I need only know that you are ready to leave home behind.<br />
Noctis: Don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;m ready as I&#8217;ll ever be.</p>
<p>[Noctis turns to leave once again; the king again interrupts his doing so]<br />
Regis: Take care on the long road.</p>
<p>[Noctis stops once more and turns; Regis continues speaking as he walks to Noctis again]<br />
Regis: Wheresoever you should go, the line of Lucis goes with you.</p>
<p>[Regis puts his left hand on Noctis&#8217;s right shoulder]<br />
Regis: Walk tall, my son.</p>
<p>[The scene fades to black]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<h3>A Sworn Promise</h3>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="center;">
<hr size="2" /></div>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>CHAPTER 1 &#8211; Departure</strong></span><br />
Prince Noctis Lucis Caelum sets forth from his homeland with his three-man retinue in tow. His destination: Altissia, capital of Accordo, where he will formalize the union of states through his marriage to Lady Lunafreya of the imperial province of Tenebrae.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[The scene fades in onto a highway; a car is cruising down the road; in the road ahead of the car sits Noctis behind a large, fancy broken-down car; Prompto is on his back a couple of feet away; Gladio is standing beside the car and tries to wave down the approaching vehicle; Ignis is behind the wheel of their broken-down car, the Regalia; the civilian car approaching them just goes around them, honks a couple of times as if in annoyance, and continues on down the highway; Noctis yawns]<br />
Gladiolus: I think we can forget about hitching our way there&#8230; Thought people were friendly outside the city.<br />
Ignis: You can only go so far on the kindness of strangers.<br />
Gladio: Just gonna have to push her all the way.<br />
Prompto: I&#8217;ve already pushed myself&#8230;to the brink of death.</p>
<p>[Gladio smacks Noct on the back to get his attention and walks over to Prompto]<br />
Gladiolus: Oh, get up.</p>
<p>[Gladio kicks Prompto&#8217;s foot]<br />
Gladio: C&#8217;mon, car isn&#8217;t gonna move itself.</p>
<p>[Noct and Prompto get up]</p>
<p>[Note: The audio here has Prompto say &#8220;Sheesh&#8221;]<br />
Prompto: I thought the <em>car</em> was supposed to move <em>us</em>.</p>
<p>[Gladio gets his hands in position on the back of the Regalia while Noctis and Prompto get in place on either side of the car]<br />
Noctis: Wouldn&#8217;t that be nice—<br />
Gladio: Can it. Ready&#8230;</p>
<p>[Noct and Prompto groan]<br />
Gladio: Steady&#8230; Push!</p>
<p>[The Chocobros resume their journey the hard way; &#8220;Stand by Me,&#8221; performed by Florence + the Machine, begins to play; their vehicle being large and heavy, progress is slow]<br />
Noctis: Un. Believable.<br />
Gladiolus: Not exactly a fairy tale beginning, huh, Prince Noctis?<br />
Ignis: We let ourselves get carried away.<br />
Prompto: Look, these things happen!<br />
Gladiolus: Let&#8217;s just hope this isn&#8217;t some omen.<br />
Noctis: Gladio, do me a favor.<br />
Gladio: What?<br />
Noct: Push this thing by yourself.<br />
Gladio: All by myself?<br />
Prompto: You won&#8217;t even notice if we just let go.<br />
Gladio: Prompto, don&#8217;t even think about it.<br />
Ignis: Save some breath for pushing.<br />
Noctis: Ignis, c&#8217;mon—time to switch!<br />
Gladiolus: Nuh-uh! We just switched back there!<br />
Prompto: And it&#8217;s my turn, Noct.<br />
Ignis: His &#8220;turn.&#8221;<br />
Prompto: My hands are killing me.<br />
Gladiolus: You rather I kill you with mine?<br />
Prompto: Easy there, tough guy.<br />
Noctis: Any luck?<br />
Ignis: Only a busy signal.<br />
Prompto: Hold the phone—is it just me, or was it supposed to be way closer?<br />
Ignis: I assure you the map is correct.<br />
Noctis: The map said Hammerhead was right there.<br />
Prompto: Literally next door.<br />
Gladio: Looks that way on a map of the world.</p>
<p>[The four are quiet for a moment as they continue struggling to make their way]<br />
Noctis: The world&#8217;s a big old place.<br />
Ignis: Filled with wonders.</p>
<p>[Note: The audio here has Prompto say &#8220;Tell that to my legs&#8221; followed by Gladio asking &#8220;You guys even pushing?&#8221;; Prompto replies &#8220;Hard as I can!&#8221;]</p>

&#8212;</p>
<p>(once the Chocobros get the car to Hammerhead)<br />
[The scene fades in on the large Hammerhead sign, then slowly pans down to the Chocobros and the car; Prompto is laying on the ground exhausted; the legs of a young woman come into view as she approaches the Regalia; taking notice of her, Prompto quickly gets back up]<br />
Cindy: Hey there, y&#8217;all kept a girl waitin&#8217;!</p>
<p>[She looks around]<br />
Cindy: Now, which one&#8217;s the prince?</p>
<p>[Noctis stands up into view from the other side of the Regalia]<br />
Cindy: Aha! Hello, Your Highness. Congrats on your wedding!<br />
Noctis: Not hitched just yet.<br />
Cindy: Lady Lunafreya&#8217;s groom-to-be, here in Hammerhead.<br />
Ignis: Apologies for taking so long.<br />
Cindy: You&#8217;d best save your apologies for Paw-paw.<br />
Gladiolus: Well, that makes you&#8230;<br />
Cindy: Cindy—Cid&#8217;s grease-monkey granddaughter.</p>
<p>[Cid suddenly shouts out to her]<br />
Cid: Roll &#8216;er in while I&#8217;m still young!</p>
<p>[Cindy&#8217;s grandfather comes walking up to the Regalia now]<br />
Cid: Didn&#8217;t yer daddy tell ya? She&#8217;s a custom classic, not some beat-up ol&#8217; clunker.</p>
<p>[Cid looks the car over, then looks at Noctis]<br />
Cid: Prince Noctis.<br />
Noctis: Uh, yeah.<br />
Cid: &#8220;Prince.&#8221; Like they took your old man and kicked the dignity out of him.<br />
Noctis: What?</p>
<p>[Cid resumes inspecting the Regalia]<br />
Cid: You got a long way to go, son. And that slack jaw&#8217;s gettin&#8217; you nowhere fast. She&#8217;s gonna take a while. Y&#8217;all get her in and run along.</p>
<p>[Cid walks off; Cindy looks after him and sighs before turning back to the others]<br />
Cindy: Y&#8217;all heard him! Let&#8217;s get movin&#8217;. Right this way.</p>
<p>[Cindy motions for the others to follow her and walks off; the scene now transitions to the Chocobros standing outside the garage at Hammerhead, the Regalia inside being fixed; Cindy stands a few feet away]<br />
Ignis: And now we play the waiting game.<br />
Prompto: Never liked that game.<br />
Noctis: Never any good at it, either.</p>

<p>(speaking to Dave once more)<br />
Dave: Well, whatever it is, we oughta take it out before it can spawn any more like it.<br />

<p>(as Noct begins to walk away from the shack, Ignis taps him on the shoulder)<br />
Ignis: It would be wise to rest up before we set out.</p>
<p>A formidable foe awaits.<br />
Prepare for this encounter by resting at the nearby haven.<br />
Ignis will cook a status-boosting meal for the party.</p>
<p>[A prompt appears to select either &#8220;Yeah, good idea.&#8221; or &#8220;Nah, I&#8217;m good.&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Yeah, good idea.<br />
Ignis: In that case, let&#8217;s find a spot to make camp.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Nah, I&#8217;m good.<br />
Ignis: Just remember confidence will only take you so far.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>Gladiolus: The Hunters are really out in full force around here, huh?<br />
Prompto: So, they&#8217;re the new Crownsguard or something?<br />
Ignis: Similar, though technically a civilian outfit.<br />
Gladio: They&#8217;ve definitely seen a lot more action than we have.<br />
Prompto: Uh&#8230; Is it cool that we rock Crownsguard outfits?<br />
Noctis: Be worse not to. They made &#8217;em especially for us.<br />
Gladio: Even got a sweet insignia on &#8217;em.<br />
Ignis: In the Crownsguard, your attire identifies you. So wear it with pride.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(on the way to the bloodhorn)<br />
Prompto: Sometimes I wonder if we&#8217;ll ever sit inside that beautiful car again.<br />
Gladiolus: Sitting most of the day was pretty nice.<br />
Noctis: Napping was even better.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(still on the way to the bloodhorn)<br />
Noctis: There&#8217;s only so far a man can walk.<br />
Prompto: Our Crown City upbringing didn&#8217;t prepare us for this.<br />
Ignis: Pretend you&#8217;re walking to the car.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as Noct and his friends approach the bloodhorn)<br />
Prompto: Over there! That&#8217;s it, right?<br />
Gladio: That&#8217;s a dualhorn?<br />
Ignis: Yes, but not your run-of-the-mill breed. We&#8217;d best make quick work of it.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as they get closer)<br />
[A smoke-like energy can now be observed emanating from the dualhorn&#8217;s horns; the creature paws the ground as though preparing to charge like a bull; Noctis is rushing it head on, but Gladio and Ignis grab him)<br />
Gladio: Wait a sec!<br />
Prompto: What—scared, big guy?<br />
Gladio: You oughta be, too. Thing&#8217;s vicious.</p>
<p>[Gladio gets between the dualhorn and the others, then stabs his sword into the ground]<br />
Prompto: You sure? Looks tame to me.<br />
Noctis: Yeah.</p>
<p>[The dualhorn begins charging toward them]<br />
Ignis: Look out!</p>
<p>[Gladio pulls his sword out of the ground and cuts into one of the large beast&#8217;s front legs as it nears him; it falls down]<br />
Prompto: Yeah! Show him who&#8217;s boss!<br />
Noctis: Nice one.</p>
<p>[The dualhorn gets back up]<br />
Ignis: It&#8217;s not over yet!<br />
Gladio: Ready for round two? Bring it!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon defeating the bloodhorn)<br />
[Noctis&#8217;s phone rings]<br />
Prompto: Ring ring!</p>
<p>[Noctis answers his phone]<br />
Noctis: Hello?<br />
Cindy: Hey! Dave just called an&#8217; said he&#8217;s safe. Thanks for findin&#8217; him.<br />
Noctis: &#8216;Kay.<br />
Cindy: Nice work, y&#8217;all. By the way, the old girl&#8217;s looking good as new. She&#8217;ll be waiting at the garage.<br />
Noctis: Gotcha.</p>

<p>(on the way back to Hammerhead)<br />
Gladio: So, who&#8217;s up next behind the wheel?<br />
Prompto: Ignis should take it and never let go.<br />
Gladio: It helps that he can keep four eyes on the dash.<br />
Prompto: I couldn&#8217;t even keep one.<br />
Noctis: Not sure I&#8217;d do any better.<br />
Ignis: Put me in the driver&#8217;s seat.<br />
Gladio: Good, &#8217;cause I need the legroom in back.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the royal retinue nears Hammerhead)<br />
Prompto: It&#8217;s rude to keep a girl waiting. You&#8217;d better apologi— What is THAT!?</p>
<p>[The four look up to see an enormous bird in flight descend toward them then pull up not far from them and pass on by]<br />
Noctis: A live hurricane!</p>
<p>[They watch as it flies away]<br />
Prompto: That thing&#8217;s like half-bird, half-storm, half-airship!<br />
Gladio: You realize that&#8217;s three halves&#8230;<br />
Ignis: Would explain its size.<br />
Noctis: Awesome in every sense.<br />

<p>(beginning the &#8220;The Errand Prince&#8221; quest upon completing the &#8220;The Mutant Marauder&#8221; quest when speaking to Cindy once again back at Hammerhead)<br />
Cindy: Sorry &#8217;bout the wait. Ain&#8217;t she purdy?<br />
Gladiolus: She&#8217;s almost too pretty for the road.<br />
Prompto: She&#8217;s back! We should all get a picture with her!</p>
<p>[Prompto hands his camera to Cindy; the others all assemble in front of the Regalia and Cindy takes their picture; the scene fades to black, then fades in on Cindy finishing up a conversation with Noctis]<br />
Cindy: All the more reason to ride with care. Oh, and before I forget— Would y&#8217;all mind makin&#8217; a little delivery for me?</p>

<p>Cindy: Thought you&#8217;d say yes, so I already put it in the trunk. There should be a motel on your way to Galdin. If y&#8217;all wouldn&#8217;t mind giving that to the owner, that&#8217;d be swell.<br />

Remodel the Regalia into the Type-D and take your adventure off-road.</p>

<p>(taking the &#8220;Stirred, Not Shaken&#8221; tour with Ignis, which is triggered by camping at Cotisse Haven)<br />
[At camp, Noct is asleep in his chair by the fire; Ignis takes a seat in the chair next to him, and Noctis comes out of his sleep, rubbing his eyes]<br />
Ignis: Trouble you a moment, Noct?<br />
Noctis: Yeah?<br />
Ignis: I could use your help in the morning.<br />
Noctis: Me and mornings don&#8217;t usually get along.<br />

&#8212;<br />
No way<br />

<p>[Ignis gets up from his chair and walks away]<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after selecting &#8220;Sure&#8221;)<br />
Your friend has invited you on a tour.<br />
Join him at dawn tomorrow to undertake a special task.<br />
You must remain in the vicinity of your destination.</p>
<p>[In the morning, Ignis is offering some instruction to Noctis]<br />
Ignis: The key is to let the pot simmer without ever letting it burn.<br />
Noctis: How do I do that?<br />
Ignis: A few stirs here and there should suffice.</p>
<p>[Noctis begins stirring; the two talk while Ignis goes about setting bowls]<br />
Ignis: When&#8217;s the last time you cooked anything?<br />
Noctis: Um, too long ago to remember.<br />
Ignis: Back when you were a part-time cook?<br />
Noctis: Sounds right. But even back then I was pretty much just winging it.<br />
Ignis: Hardly what I&#8217;d call &#8220;cooking,&#8221; I imagine.<br />
Noctis: Just what normal people would.</p>
<p>[Ignis comes over to check on Noct&#8217;s progress]<br />
Ignis: Well, let&#8217;s see how things are stewing. Hmmm&#8230; Could use just a touch longer to thicken, if you don&#8217;t mind stirring.</p>
<p>[The two continue to talk while Noctis resumes stirring and Ignis resumes setting everything else up]<br />
Noctis: Not at all, if you don&#8217;t mind telling me what this cooking class is all about.<br />
Ignis: Oh, I was only hoping to have a fireside chat, see what&#8217;s got you stewing.<br />
Noctis: So you cooked up this little pretense. All these years, you&#8217;ve never stopped worrying about me.<br />
Ignis: My royal duty, per His Majesty.<br />
Noctis: Your hobby.</p>
<p>[Ignis is now watching Noct stir while he drinks a cup of coffee]<br />
Ignis: Now then, time for the taste test.</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
[If the stirring was done improperly]<br />
Ignis: Well. This&#8230;</p>
<p>[Noctis lifts some out with a ladle, sniffs, and makes a repulsed sound]<br />
Noct: Smells terrible. So, breakfast at the diner, then?</p>
<p>[Ignis sighs]<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
[If the stirring was done properly]<br />
Ignis: Mmm. Looks done to a turn, excellent work. Taste for yourself?</p>
<p>[Noct tastes it with a spoon and makes a pleased sound]<br />
Ignis: Sweet are the fruits of one&#8217;s own labor.<br />
Noct: Not half bad.<br />
Ignis: You must be eager to learn more of the culinary arts.<br />
Noct: Actually, I&#8217;m eager to leave the cooking to you.<br />
Ignis: My half-baked scheme, up in smoke.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[After they&#8217;ve finished]<br />
Ignis: How did you fancy returning to the stove?<br />
Noct: Can&#8217;t complain. It&#8217;s not so bad every once in a while. Just not first thing in the morning.<br />
Ignis: Now, now. The world at dawn is full of wonders.<br />
Noct: Yeah, can&#8217;t wait to marvel at them all.<br />
Ignis: Dawn tomorrow?<br />
Noct: I&#8217;ll marvel at my own pace.</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
[If the stirring was done improperly, the generic scene that plays after failing on a tour with Ignis follows]<br />
Ignis: Well, you gave a good effort.<br />
Noctis: And it still went wrong.</p>

<p>(taking the &#8220;Hallowed Hill of Hammerhead&#8221; tour with Prompto, which can be triggered by camping at Palmaugh Haven)<br />
[At camp, Noctis is crouched by the fire; Prompto comes up behind him and smacks him on his butt to get his attention]<br />
Prompto: Hey, Noct, I&#8217;ve got this&#8230;thing. Be a pal and come with me tomorrow morning? Pretty please?</p>

You must remain in the vicinity of your destination.</p>
<p>[In the morning, Noctis yawns, then he and Prompto set out toward Hammerhead]<br />
Noct: So, what is this &#8220;thing&#8221; you&#8217;ve got anyway?<br />
Prompto: Well, it&#8217;s not a &#8220;thing.&#8221; It&#8217;s a picture.<br />
Noct: Uh-huh.<br />
Prompto: In honor of the grease-monkey goddess&#8230;<br />
Noct: Huh? Who?<br />
Prompto: Cindy! I wanna express my love on film.<br />
Noct: Dude.<br />
Prompto: No, no, no—not like a stalker or something. Just an innocent display of affection.<br />
Noct: &#8220;Innocent.&#8221;<br />
Prompto: So! First we find a spot overlooking Hammerhead. Then, we bow our heads in deference to the Garage of Our Goddess.<br />
Noct: You wanna go all the way to the garage? Why don&#8217;t you just ask her for a picture?<br />
Prompto: No way! That would be creepy!<br />
[Noct sighs]<br />
Noct: Can&#8217;t believe you woke me up early for <em>this</em>.<br />
Prompto: We are on hallowed ground, Noct. And if you don&#8217;t start showing some proper respect, you&#8217;re gonna have a bad time!<br />
Noct: Yeah. Wouldn&#8217;t want that.</p>
<p>[They arrive at the spot overlooking Hammerhead]<br />
Noct: Alright, Photo Boy. Make it snappy.<br />
Prompto: I got this! First, to pay my respects:</p>
<p>[Prompto bows toward the garage]<br />
Prompto: O Great Garage, Home to Our Goddess of the Gears, wha—.</p>
<p>[The camera pans back to show that Cindy is standing behind them]<br />
Cindy: That the prince I see?</p>
<p>[Prompto spins around in surprise]<br />
Prompto: C—Cindy!?<br />
Noct: You&#8217;re not supposed to—<br />
Cindy: Just on one of my early mornin&#8217; hikes. Girl&#8217;s gotta stay fit, y&#8217;know! Ain&#8217;t it beautiful up here? One of my favorite spots. What&#8217;re y&#8217;all doin&#8217; here?<br />

Noct: Bet she&#8217;d look even better with the two of you in the shot. What do you say?<br />
Prompto: I, uh.<br />
Cindy: That&#8217;s a mighty fine idea!</p>

&#8212;</p>
<p>(after camping)<br />
Noctis: &#8230;&#8221;Like a father to her&#8221;?<br />
Gladiolus: Ever since they got back, Cid&#8217;s been the only one looking after her.<br />
Ignis: Rather more than a middling mechanic can handle.<br />
Prompto: All things considered, I&#8217;d say she turned out okay.<br />
Gladiolus: Like any girl, you just need to treat her right.<br />
Prompto: Treat her wrong and Cid&#8217;ll stuff his wrench where the sun don&#8217;t shine!<br />
Ignis: Take care of the car, and it will take care of us.<br />
Noctis: Yeah, the car&#8230;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after camping)<br />
Prompto: Not big on camping out. But can&#8217;t complain about the food.<br />
Ignis: You flatter me.<br />
Prompto: Hey, I&#8217;m serious. Can you imagine what we&#8217;d eat without Iggy to cook for us?<br />
Gladiolus: Well, you can always count on Cup Noodles.<br />
Noctis: You just can&#8217;t get enough.<br />
Gladiolus: You telling me you don&#8217;t &#8217;em?<br />
Noctis: Didn&#8217;t say that.<br />
Prompto: Road food will be a thing of the past once you&#8217;re settled down.<br />
Ignis: As will all this picky eating nonsense.<br />
Gladiolus: No skipping dinner to whip up an instant snack in the middle of the night.<br />
Noctis: I think I can handle it.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after camping)<br />
Noctis: Peaceful out here.<br />
Ignis: Dark and quiet reveal so much hidden by loud city lights.<br />
Prompto: That&#8217;s all well and good, but I&#8217;m more concerned about the things hiding in the dark.<br />
Gladiolus: Well it&#8217;s definitely no place for a moonlight stroll, but it&#8217;s not all bad.<br />
Noctis: Yeah, I kinda like it.<br />
Prompto: Never would&#8217;ve guessed.<br />
Noctis: Why not?<br />
Prompto: Because you&#8217;re a prince?<br />
Noctis: What, princes can&#8217;t enjoy the outdoors?</p>
<p>(after camping)<br />
Gladiolus: Just like my father&#8217;s stories about the big road trip.<br />
Noctis: Even the car&#8217;s the same.<br />
Prompto: Think the king and his men knew how to party like we do?<br />
Ignis: Hard to imagine. It&#8217;s always so much fun.<br />
Gladiolus: And don&#8217;t forget they were in the middle of a war. Not my kind of party.<br />
Prompto: Yeah, war&#8217;ll put a damper on things.<br />
Noct: They had the time of their lives on the road. My dad never would&#8217;ve set this up otherwise.<br />
Prompto: So they DID know how to party!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after camping)<br />
Prompto: Would hate to try and pull off a road trip like this in some old jalopy.<br />
Gladiolus: Oh yeah. That would definitely cramp my style.<br />
Ignis: We can&#8217;t live like kings, but we can travel like them.<br />
Noctis: I&#8217;d have been cool with a plain old car.<br />
Prompto: Why&#8217;s that?<br />
Noctis: Not into the &#8220;prince&#8217;s procession&#8221; thing.<br />
Prompto: Oh. You want to lay low.<br />
Ignis: Don&#8217;t see why the car would be an issue. You manage to keep a low profile in the back seat.<br />
Gladiolus: Isn&#8217;t it about time you made some headlines?<br />
Noctis: Rather be in the obituaries.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after camping)<br />
Ignis: Ever take in a view like this?<br />
Prompto: From the Crown City? No, but there weren&#8217;t beasts and daemons either.<br />
Gladiolus: Nature&#8217;s beauty comes with danger. That&#8217;s how it works in the wild.<br />
Prompto: Well, the Crystal and the Wall work for me.<br />
Ignis: Ah, but not without the king to uphold them.<br />
Gladiolus: That job will fall to you someday Noct. Hmph. Think you&#8217;ll be up to it?<br />
Noct: I&#8217;ll see what I can do.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after camping)<br />
Ignis: So, just how many photos have you taken?<br />
Prompto: Well&#8230;haven&#8217;t really been keeping count, but it&#8217;s a lot. Uh&#8230;first time outside the Crown City. You bet I&#8217;m eager!<br />
Noct: Maybe quit making faces and snap some of us, too.<br />
Prompto: My face just does that. And you always shy away from the lens.<br />
Ignis: Well, now he&#8217;s given you royal permission.<br />
Prompto: I prefer &#8220;photojournalist.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while driving at night for the first time)<br />
Prompto: Was that what I think it was?<br />
Ignis: Looked daemonic to me.<br />
Prompto: Why here? Why now?<br />
Gladiolus: I dunno, and I don&#8217;t want to find out.<br />
Noctis: Same here. I say we step on it.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(when parking at a lit-up gas station during the night)<br />
Prompto: Look at all these lights! What a relief.<br />
Ignis: Indeed. They ought to keep the daemons at bay.<br />

<p>(arriving at the Longwythe Rest Area)<br />
[Ignis parks the car in front of the motel]<br />
Ignis: Well, I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s enough for today. Might be wise to leave the driving to me until we&#8217;ve found our bearings out here.</p>
<p>Select a destination from the list of locations, and Ignis will drive there using the shortest route.</p>
<p>However, Ignis will not drive while daemons are out. At night, Noctis takes the wheel.</p>
<p>(upon speaking to the proprietor of the motel)<br />
Proprietor: Y&#8217;all came all the way out here to deliver the goods? Well, thank ya kindly. We&#8217;ll take it outta the trunk, so y&#8217;all just sit tight.</p>
<p>[A soot-colored dog suddenly walks up to the royal retinue]<br />
Noctis: Hmm? Umbra.</p>
<p>[Noct kneels beside Umbra and scratches the dog&#8217;s head]<br />
Prompto: Bringin&#8217; us stuff, atta boy!<br />
Gladiolus: That dog can really track a scent.<br />
Ignis: Certainly &#8220;nose&#8221; how to find us.<br />
Prompto: How do you always know, boy?<br />
Noctis: Just a sec.</p>
<p>[Noctis is flipping through a notebook that had come in a bag Umbra was carrying; Noct has a flashback]<br />
Tenebrae (12 Years Earlier)<br />
Noctis and Lunafreya</p>
<p>[Noctis as a much younger boy is looking at the same notebook with Lunafreya; he opens it to the first page, which has a flower with blue petals pressed onto it]<br />
Noctis: Nice flower.<br />
Lunafreya: It&#8217;s the same kind we sewed our crowns from.<br />
Noctis: Oh yeah, &#8220;sylleblossoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>[The dog, Umbra, is laying on the floor near them along with a similar white dog named Pryna]<br />
Lunafreya: So&#8230; I have a favor to ask. Take the notebook with you when you go.<br />
Noctis: Sure.<br />
Lunafreya: That&#8217;s not all. I want you to put something in the book and send it back.</p>
<p>[Noctis&#8217;s mind returns to the present; he reads Lunafreya&#8217;s message to him: &#8220;It&#8217;s come time for me to leave Tenebrae&#8221;; a prompt appears asking &#8220;What will you write back?&#8221;; the player can select either &#8220;Finally going to see you after all these years,&#8221; &#8220;Just left the Crown City,&#8221; or &#8220;Got it&#8221;; after writing a response, Noctis puts the notebook back in Umbra&#8217;s bag and scratches the dog&#8217;s head again]<br />
Noctis: All set. Take care out there.</p>
<p>[Umbra walks away]<br />
Prompto: I know. You&#8217;re not gonna tell me.<br />
Noctis: Then don&#8217;t ask.<br />
Prompto: What was that about?</p>
<p>[Noctis doesn&#8217;t respond]<br />
Prompto: Ya don&#8217;t say?</p>
<p>[The four begin to walk about]<br />
Ignis: Now that our work&#8217;s done, let&#8217;s see ourselves to Galdin.<br />

(beginning the &#8220;Gone Hunting&#8221; quest when speaking with the motel receptionist in the parking lot)<br />
Receptionist: Hold on a sec, sir. I found an envelope addressed to Meldacio inside the package.<br />
Gladiolus: Meldacio? The Hunter HQ?<br />
Receptionist: Yessir. The Head Hunter oughta be around here somewhere. Mind makin&#8217; one more delivery?<br />
Prompto: Whaddaya say, Noct? Might as well while we&#8217;re in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>(quest description for &#8220;Gone Hunting&#8221;)<br />
Hunting is hazardous business, and many men and women fall in the line of duty. The Head Hunter is tasked with keeping tabs on those in the field and searching for those who go missing. Now, however, Noctis must track down the Head Hunter himself to make a special delivery.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Dave nearby)<br />
Dave: Well, look who it is. I really owe you boys one.</p>
<p>(selecting &#8220;Yes&#8221; when the prompt appears to hand the envelope to Dave)<br />
Noctis: Make that two.<br />
Dave: Can&#8217;t seem to catch a break.</p>
<p>[The scene briefly fades to black, then fades in to Dave shaking his head]<br />
Dave: Looks like they found another one.<br />
Prompto: Wait, uh—found another what?<br />
Dave: Tag. Us hunters keep &#8217;em on our person at all times as identification.<br />
Prompto: What—in case you forgot who you are?<br />
Gladiolus: More like so no one else forgets who they <em>were</em>.<br />
Dave: Hunters lead a life of danger, and sometimes these tags are the only thing that makes it back in one piece. It&#8217;s our job to deliver &#8217;em to the families of the fallen. As it were, I came out here to do just that. If y&#8217;all happen to find any tags lyin&#8217; around out there, could ya do me a favor and send &#8217;em my way?<br />
Noctis: Yeah, sure.<br />
Dave: Word is somebody spotted a tag &#8217;round these parts. Try askin&#8217; the local tipster; he&#8217;ll point ya in the right direction.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Dave again)<br />
Dave: Like I always tell my hunters, &#8220;Knowledge is power that&#8217;ll save your ass.&#8221; Stay informed. Might save your ass someday, too.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Dave again)<br />
Dave: Never got a chance to properly express my gratitude for the other day. Thanks for bailin&#8217; me outta there.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Dave once more)<br />
Dave: Lotta folks think they gotta be tough to be the best hunter, but the best hunters are the ones who know when they ain&#8217;t tough enough.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as Noct and his retinue walk away)<br />
Gladiolus: Those tags are heavy stuff.<br />
Ignis: They certainly carry emotional weight. We&#8217;d best find and return them.<br />
Prompto: And give the families peace of mind.<br />
Noctis: Let&#8217;s start by following up on that hot tip.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Noct and his retinue locate an abandoned and extinguished fire in the wilderness, then notice a sabertusk nearby slinking away]<br />
Prompto: It came from there.</p>
<p>[Noct and the others follow the sabertusk back to its pack, which surround the missing hunter&#8217;s dog tag]<br />

(upon locating the sabertusks)<br />
Prompto: We better stay on our toes.<br />
Noctis: Without any kind of plan?<br />
Ignis: Mind your manners.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon retrieving the dog tag)<br />
Ignis: That must be it.<br />
Prompto: So this belongs—belonged—to a hunter.<br />
Gladiolus: There&#8217;s no point in holding onto something that ain&#8217;t ours.<br />
Noctis: Yeah, let&#8217;s deliver it to Dave.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<div class="spdiv">[collapse]</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>(completing the &#8220;Gone Hunting&#8221; quest after returning the tag to Dave)<br />
Dave: Found one already, huh? Ya done good.<br />
Noctis: Just pickin&#8217; up the pieces, I guess.<br />
Dave: Well, try to keep your spirits up. Even though I ain&#8217;t one to talk. I beat myself up over the lives of the hunters I couldn&#8217;t save. That&#8217;s what each one of these tags means to me. They hurt. But if I let that grief keep me from lookin&#8217; for &#8217;em, then their tags and their lives&#8217;ll be forgotten forever. And that&#8217;d hurt more than anything.<br />
Noctis: Yeah, guess you&#8217;re right.<br />
Dave: That&#8217;s why I tell all my hunters to collect any tag they see—and I expect you boys to go out and do the same.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(coming near and examining the warning sign near the Longwythe Rest Area Crow&#8217;s Nest)<br />
Gladiolus: See that over there?<br />
Noctis: What about it?</p>
<p>Wandering the Weaverwilds?<br />
Watch out for sabertusks!</p>
<p>Gladio: Looks wild.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(examining the Kenny Crow poster in the Longwythe Rest Area Crow&#8217;s Nest)<br />

Kids and crows agree: those crispy, golden taters can&#8217;t be beat!<br />
Nothing tastes better than what we make together—at the Crow&#8217;s Nest!</p>
<p>Noctis: Some kind of bird.<br />
Prompto: I&#8217;m big on birds.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing an NPC in the Longwythe Rest Area Crow&#8217;s Nest)<br />
Man: Saw a magitek trooper the other day. Those things are downright unsettling.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing an NPC in the Longwythe Rest Area Crow&#8217;s Nest)<br />
Man: There&#8217;s more dangerous things prowling about these days.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing an NPC in the Longwythe Rest Area Crow&#8217;s Nest)<br />
Man: Ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; special, but I love the food here. Tastes just like something my Ma used to make!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing a conversation in the Longwythe Rest Area Crow&#8217;s Nest)<br />
Man (1): Man, is this good or what!?<br />
Man (2): It is! Not too salty—just right.<br />
Man (1): Yeah! None of those fancy-schmancy spices that those snobs in Galdin like.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing a conversation in the Longwythe Rest Area Crow&#8217;s Nest)<br />
Man (1): All this land and not a soul in sight.<br />
Man (2): Just wild ones—only things living this side of the peak are varmints.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing a conversation in the Longwythe Rest Area Crow&#8217;s Nest)<br />
Man (1): Isn&#8217;t there supposed to be a quarry around here?<br />
Man (2): Not anymore. It&#8217;s a shame, though: they say it was a virtual mineral motherlode.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing a conversation in the Longwythe Rest Area Crow&#8217;s Nest)<br />
Man (1): What d&#8217;you reckon that rig&#8217;s for?<br />
Man (2): They say it saw a lot of use at the old quarry, but ain&#8217;t nobody ventured inside since the daemons took over.<br />
Man (1): Ah, the Balouve Mines. Is it really as bad as they say it is?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing a conversation in the Longwythe Rest Area Crow&#8217;s Nest)<br />
Man (1): What a breath of fresh air: natural beauty for miles, and nothing to spoil the view.<br />
Man (2): Not now anyway. This place once teemed with people, until the mines went under.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing yet another conversation in the Longwythe Rest Area Crow&#8217;s Nest)<br />
Man (1): Y&#8217;think that motel makes any money? I never seen anyone in there!<br />
Man (2): Yeah. They make their money off tour groups headed for Longwythe.<br />

<p>(encountering Sania outside the Balouve Mines)<br />
Sania: Curiosity may bring you to the door—but no further.<br />
&#8212;</p>

Sania: It would be a downright shame to go all that way, only to find yourself locked out of the last door.<br />
&#8212;</p>

Sania: Believe me—opportunity doesn&#8217;t knock when the door is locked. Be sure to bring the key in with you.<br />

Noctis: Nah, no need to rush to happily ever after.<br />
Prompto: Wow. Still can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re actually tying the knot, dude! How does it feel now that it&#8217;s finally happening?<br />
Noctis: Fine, I guess?<br />
Prompto: C&#8217;mon, you can&#8217;t fool me. Any guy would be over the moon to marry her!<br />

Gladiolus: Kinda wanna go for a dip.<br />
Noctis: That a big mountain behind it?<br />
Ignis: No, it&#8217;s an island.<br />
Prompto: Nobody goes to Galdin for an island, though. They go to kick back and get massages!<br />
Ignis: And savor the seafood. It&#8217;s famously delicious.<br />
Noctis: Sounds great.<br />

<p>Ignis: A feature on the wedding.<br />
Prompto: Get a load of Lady Lunafreya&#8217;s dress!<br />
Gladiolus: That&#8217;s some fancy fabric work. Bet the groom can&#8217;t wait to see it on his bride-to-be.<br />
Prompto: He&#8217;s not the only one. She&#8217;s gonna be an absolute knockout!<br />
Ignis: The dress is bespoke, of course, and comes courtesy of one of Altissia&#8217;s most foremost fashion designers.<br />
Gladiolus: Bet the food&#8217;s gonna be pretty damn fancy, too.<br />
Noctis: Meh, as long as it&#8217;s something I can eat.<br />

Prompto: Royally embarrassing. I can&#8217;t wait to taste some Altissian seafood!<br />
Gladiolus: Galdin&#8217;s famous for fish, too.<br />
Noctis: Fish sounds good.<br />
Ignis: So does a balanced meal.<br />
Prompto: How &#8217;bout we try some local surf?<br />
Noctis: How &#8217;bout we catch some ourselves?<br />

[At camp, Noctis comes out of the tent and is immediately greeted by Gladio smacking him on the back to get his attention]<br />
Noctis: I wish Ignis would get off my back.<br />
Gladiolus: He&#8217;d ease up if you could just get up in the morning. A cure for sleeping in&#8230; Alright. Crack of dawn tomorrow, we train at the beach.</p>

Noct: Alrighty.</p>
<p>[Noct follows Gladio down to the beach, then to a rock wall jutting out into the water]<br />
Noct: So, what&#8217;re we gonna do exactly?<br />
Gladio: We&#8217;re going for a run. Nice and simple.<br />
Noct: That&#8217;s all?<br />
Gladio: Try saying that when your lungs are ripe to burst. Sand&#8217;s tough to run on. There&#8217;s no better way to improve stamina, and no better time to do it than first thing in the morning. To make it interesting, what say we race?<br />
Noct: Race?<br />
Gladio: With stakes. If you lose, you have to train with me every day.<br />
Noct: Then I can&#8217;t lose, can I?</p>
<p>[The camera shifts far up the beach to the fishing dock]<br />
Gladio: That there&#8217;s the goal. Now let&#8217;s get started! Ready, set, GO!<br />

Noct: Hmm? What about the wager?<br />

Noct: Yesss!</p>
<p>[After Noct has pumped his fists in celebration and Gladio has flexed his arms in frustration, Gladio points at Noctis]<br />
Gladio: Well done, Noct. There&#8217;s no way Specs can complain when you come back to camp this early, encrusted in sand. Make sure you act nice and smug when you see him.<br />
Noct: Yeah. If this doesn&#8217;t shut Ignis up, I don&#8217;t know what will. I gotta say, though&#8230;it&#8217;s kinda nice at this hour.</p>
<p>[The camera pans back to offer a wider view of the area]<br />
Gladio: Even if that&#8217;s all you take from this, that&#8217;s good enough for me. C&#8217;mon, let&#8217;s go.</p>

<p>(upon reaching the main venue at Galdin Quay)<br />
Staff: Welcome to Galdin Quay.</p>
<p>[A man with unkempt hair and clad in multiple layers of dark clothing &#8212; attire that could oddly be described as both fancy and disheveled &#8212; approaches the four friends as they walk in]<br />
Suspcious Stranger: I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re out of luck.<br />
Noctis: Are we?<br />
Suspicious Stranger: The boats bring you here.<br />
Prompto: What about &#8217;em.<br />
Suspicious Stranger: Well, they&#8217;ll not take you forth.<br />
Gladiolus: And what&#8217;s your story?<br />
Suspicious Stranger: I&#8217;m an impatient traveler, ready to turn ship. The ceasefire&#8217;s getting us nowhere.</p>
<p>[The stranger turns and tosses a coin at Noctis; Gladiolus snatches it out of the air before it can get to the prince]<br />
Gladiolus: What&#8217;s this? Some sort of souvenir?<br />
Prompto: They make those?<br />
Noctis: What? No.<br />
Suspicious Stranger: Consider it your allowance.<br />
Gladio: Yeah, and who&#8217;s allowing us?<br />
Suspicious Stranger: A man of no consequence.</p>
<p>[The stranger leaves]<br />
Noctis: Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Intricate Coin x 1</p>
<p>Prompto: You believe what that guy said about the port being closed?<br />
Ignis: I&#8217;m skeptical, though I won&#8217;t discount the possibility.<br />
Gladio: I say we go check it out for ourselves.<br />

Prompto: Aw, man. Not a ship in sight. What gives?</p>
<p>[A young man in a fine suit sits on a bench nearby and addresses them]<br />
Dino: According to my sources, the empire, giving strict orders not to let any vessels leave the docks of Altissia. Real shame if you were late to your own wedding—right, Prince Noctis? Name&#8217;s Dino, by the way. Pleasure. The crown prince of Lucis, bounty hunting in his fancy car&#8230; Surely you didn&#8217;t think it&#8217;d go unnoticed—at least not by this reporter? Lucky for you, this reporter has integrity. If you wanna remain incognito, I&#8217;ll respect your wish&#8230;in exchange for a favor.</p>

Listen to him<br />
Noctis: What do you want?<br />
Dino: Hey, I knew you&#8217;d come around! Lemme see your map.</p>
<p>[Noctis hands it to him; Dino returns it a moment later following a short fade to black]<br />
Dino; Marked where you need to go on your map. All you gotta do is find me some rough gemstones—like this one. Do this, and your ship&#8217;ll come in. Don&#8217;t, and the papers&#8217;ll run you outta town. Capisce?<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Stand my ground<br />
Noctis: I don&#8217;t owe you anything.<br />
Ignis: Wait. We mustn&#8217;t rub him the wrong way.<br />
Dino: The sound of tacit agreement! Here.</p>

<p>(speaking with Dino again)<br />
Dino: I&#8217;ll make sure you got a boat to ride, alright?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Dino once more)<br />
Dino: So what&#8217;s the scoop on this little road trip anyway? Some kind of secret bachelor gig?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after beginning the &#8220;A Gentleman&#8217;s Agreement&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />
Prompto: He&#8217;s really got your number, Noct.<br />
Gladiolus: Not like we made much effort to keep it secret.<br />
Ignis: Even if we had, the press always finds a way. We needn&#8217;t befriend him, but we&#8217;d best not make him our enemy.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(when departing Galdin Quay after beginning the &#8220;A Gentleman&#8217;s Agreement&#8221; quest)<br />
Gladiolus: Maybe Cid was right about your lack of dignity.<br />
Prompto: You&#8217;re one step above delivery boy.<br />
Ignis: Royal rank carries little weight outside the Crown City.<br />
Noctis: Glad it&#8217;s not weighing me down.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(when arriving in the vicinity of the mineral deposit)<br />
Noct: You sure we&#8217;re in the right spot?<br />
Gladio: According to the map. Let&#8217;s check it out.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[The Chocobros scale some rock formations along the side of the road, which they follow across a small rock bridge to an outcrop where they find the enormous bird that swooped at them near Hammerhead; it&#8217;s asleep]<br />
Prompto: Oh em gee. We&#8217;re supposed to get near that thing?<br />
Gladio: Pipe down before you wake it up.<br />

<p>[They sneak around to the other side of the zu and locate the garnet stone Dino sent them to find; on their way back out, however, they cause the bird to wake up; it unfurls its wings and takes flight]<br />
Ignis: Off it goes&#8230;<br />
Noct: Oh, we made it out alive.<br />
Prompto: Barely. I seriously thought we were at journey&#8217;s end.<br />
Gladio: But that feat was fit for a king.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(completing the &#8220;A Gentleman&#8217;s Agreement&#8221; quest)<br />
Dino: Nice work, kid! Sorry for giving you such a hard time. I just had to get my hands on this, even if it meant blackmail. You understand, don&#8217;t ya? Y&#8217;see, I&#8217;m a reporter by day, and an amateur jeweler by night. This elusive little beauty&#8217;s gonna become a masterpiece. To make it up to you, I&#8217;ll share a little scoop. That special coin you got—it commemorates the Oracle&#8217;s ascension. That guy was tossing &#8217;em out to everyone. Musta picked &#8217;em up back in Niflheim.

[Noctis comes across a cat on the boardwalk leading to the main venue at Galdin Quay]<br />
Noctis: Hey, buddy. What&#8217;s up? Taking a little stroll? How come you&#8217;re all alone? You must be hungry. Gotta come up with some cat food.<br />
Gladiolus: Could always buy some.<br />
Prompto: Or we could fish for some.<br />

Coctura: That the best pick-up line you&#8217;ve got?<br />
Noctis: What? No, I—there&#8217;s this cat over there.<br />
Coctura: I&#8217;m only teasing. I have a feeling I know the feline you&#8217;ve got in mind. Let me whip something up. Paying customers come first, though, and someone just ordered the last fish on hand. Would you mind catching another one of these while I make their meal?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon returning to Coctura with another fish)<br />
Coctura: Great! I&#8217;ll start on it right away. Y&#8217;know, this is really thoughtful of you, but be warned: cats are clingy, and they&#8217;re notoriously picky eaters, too.<br />
Noctis: Picky eaters&#8230;you don&#8217;t say.<br />
Coctura: When it comes to food, felines are quite finicky—so you were wise to entrust the cooking to me. Here.</p>

Ignis: There was an attack. The imperial army has taken the Crown City.<br />
Gladiolus: &#8220;As treaty room tempers flared, blasts lit the night sky. When the smoke about the Citadel had cleared, the king was found&#8230;dead.&#8221;<br />
Noctis: No, wait, hold on&#8230;<br />

Ignis: That the signing was last night, that Insomnia—<br />
Noctis: But the wedding! Altissia!<br />

Gladiolus: Look at the size of those things.<br />

Gladiolus: The robots?<br />
Ignis: Mass-produced humanoid weapons of warfare, to be more precise.<br />

Ignis: Marshal.<br />
Cor: At last, Your Highness.<br />
Noct: Yeah, wanna tell me what I&#8217;m here for?<br />
Cor: The power of kings, passed from the old to the new through the bonding of souls. One such soul lies before you. To claim your forebears&#8217; power is your birthright and duty as king.<br />
Noct: My duty as king of what?<br />
Cor: Now is not the time to question your calling. A king is sworn to protect his people.<br />
Noct: And yet he chose to protect only one prince. Was that his calling? Forsake the masses to spare his own son?<br />
Cor: How long will you remain the protected? The king entrusted the role of protector to you.<br />
Noct: &#8220;Entrusted&#8221; it to me? Then why didn&#8217;t he tell me that? Why did he stand there smiling as I left? Why— Why did he lie to me?<br />
Cor: That day, he didn&#8217;t want you to remember him as the king. In what time you had left, he wanted to be your father. He always had faith in you, that when the time came, you would ascend for the sake of your people.<br />
Noct: Guess he left me no choice.</p>
<p>[Noct holds out his hand; the sword on the sarcophagus phases through the casket&#8217;s hands, floats into the air, hangs there briefly, and then flies into Noctis, imbuing him with his ancestor&#8217;s power]</p>
<p>Sword of the Wise x 1<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(once Noct has obtained the Sword of the Wise)<br />
Cor: That&#8217;s not the only power your forebears left you. Your journey&#8217;s just begun. Another tomb lies close by. I suggest you head there next. There are tombs scattered across the land. All are on dangerous ground. I&#8217;ll go with you, for the time being. Not only to help, but to get a measure of your strength.<br />
Noct: So just how many of these &#8220;powers&#8221; are out there?<br />
Cor: There are thirteen known royal arms, each enshrined at a royal tomb, though we know the location of only a few. I&#8217;ve enlisted the Hunters. They comb the land in search of the lost tombs.<br />
Noct: Where&#8217;s the one nearby you mentioned?<br />
Cor: Keycatrich Trench. We know there to be a crypt deep inside the tunnels.<br />

Cindy: You can make some real purdy mineral paints with the right stones. Sometimes we even have &#8217;em treated and use &#8217;em in car parts!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Cindy again after beginning the &#8220;The Ever Elegant Regalia&#8221; quest)<br />
Cindy: Sadly, this ore ain&#8217;t for you. Sorry, y&#8217;all. But I promise I&#8217;ll give ya somethin&#8217; I think you&#8217;ll really like!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after beginning the &#8220;The Ever Elegant Regalia&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />
Prompto: I&#8217;d do just about anything Cindy asked me.<br />
Gladiolus: Desperate much?<br />
Prompto: I&#8217;m not desperate. I just want to serve milady.<br />
Noctis: &#8220;His lady.&#8221;<br />
Ignis: Presumptuous.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;The Ever Elegant Regalia&#8221;)<br />
Taking care of a complex vehicle like the Regalia is no easy task. To express his gratitude to Cindy, Noctis offers to find her the ore she desires.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(arriving outside Balouve Mines)<br />
Prompto: This should be the place&#8230;<br />
Gladiolus: Keep your eyes peeled for the ore. And for trouble.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Upon entering Balouve Mines, the Chocobros find an old elevator]<br />
Prompto: Wow. That might be the oldest elevator I&#8217;ve ever seen.<br />
Ignis: Might still work.<br />
Gladiolus: Hop on and find out.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon locating the ore)<br />
Noctis: Found it! Check it out.</p>
<p>Redstone Shard x 1</p>
<p>Ignis: Good work. Let&#8217;s head back at once.<br />
Gladiolus: Not the kind of place you wanna come every day.<br />
Prompto: Yeah, not even if you&#8217;re a hunter.<br />
Ignis: And ore takes time to refine.<br />
Noctis: No wonder Cindy&#8217;s always so busy.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[The Chocobros open the doors to the elevator]<br />
Gladiolus: Going down?<br />
Prompto: Are you sure this thing can hold all of us at the same time?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[They board the elevator and head down into the mine]<br />
Prompto: All aboard, huh.<br />
Gladiolus: What? Afraid it can&#8217;t take our weight?<br />
Ignis: More likely to become stuck.<br />
Prompto: I can live with stuck.<br />
Noctis: This thing&#8217;s been around a while.<br />
Ignis: I can only guess when they began mining here.<br />
Prompto: Know what sorta place this is?<br />
Gladiolus: The sort that&#8217;s infested with bloodthirsty daemons—am I warm?<br />
Noctis: Red hot, I&#8217;d say.<br />
Prompto: Gimme a break&#8230;<br />
Ignis: There&#8217;s no telling how deep the shaft goes.<br />
Gladiolus: All the way to hell.</p>
<p>[The elevator comes to a stop]<br />
Ignis: Here we are.<br />
Gladiolus: We could always take it down deeper.<br />
Prompto: Bit of a &#8220;shot in the dark,&#8221; don&#8217;tcha think?</p>
<p>[A prompt appears asking &#8220;Ride the elevator further? (Current floor: B1F)&#8221;; the player can select either &#8220;Exit&#8221; or &#8220;Continue&#8221;]</p>
<p>(upon selecting &#8220;Exit&#8221;)<br />
Noctis: This&#8217;ll do.</p>
<p>[The elevator doors open]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as Noct and the royal retinue begin making their way through the mine)<br />
Ignis: It&#8217;s quiet—too quiet.<br />
Gladio: Baddies could pounce anytime from anywhere. Keep your heads on a swivel.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(continuing on)<br />
Ignis: The track&#8217;s laid out for us.<br />
Prompto: Is this&#8230; a mine cart?<br />
Gladio: That&#8217;s how they shipped out whatever they dug up.<br />
Noctis: Hmmm.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as they follow the tracks further)<br />
Prompto: Whoa! Startled me. Anyone hear that rumbling?<br />
Ignis: Something&#8217;s coming towards us!<br />
Prompto: Whatever it is, it&#8217;s moving pretty damn fast!<br />
Gladiolus: From behind—Look out!</p>
<p>[The mine cart they passed a moment earlier suddenly comes barreling by]<br />
Gladiolus: I doubt the cart started rolling on its own.<br />
Ignis: Something or someone moved it.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[As the four friends venture down a tunnel after the cart, either the same one or another comes rolling back toward them]<br />
Ignis: Coming right at us!<br />
Prompto: Again!? Look out!<br />
Gladio: Incoming!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Coming upon another cart park along the tracks, it suddenly jolts toward them as well as a goblin daemon shoves it at them]<br />
Prompto: Caught &#8217;em red-footed!<br />
Noctis: That little son of a—<br />
Gladio: Teach &#8217;em what rolls around, comes around.<br />
Ignis: We&#8217;ll all breathe easier once we&#8217;ve put the matter to rest.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[After killing the goblin and another of its kind, Noct and the others proceed down an incline leading to a lower level]<br />
Ignis: Well, down and down we go.<br />
Prompto: Oh, do we have to?<br />
Noctis: You know the answer to that.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Following the path down to another set of tracks running from left to right, another mine cart comes rolling past them from the left just as they reach this split; following the tracks from the direction the mine cart came, they soon arrive on a narrow trestle that the tracks run across; a tall, humanoid silhouette can vaguely be made out walking toward them]<br />
Gladio: Huh? The hell?</p>
<p>[The figure steps into the light, revealing itself to be an aramusha, a ronin-like daemon; suddenly, a cart with a goblin riding in it comes barreling down the track from behind the humanoid-looking daemon]<br />
Prompto: C&#8217;mon, carts again!?<br />
Gladio: Move aside!<br />
Ignis: Quickly!</p>
<p>[The cart strikes Noctis, knocking him down; as he gets to his feet, but before he can fully recover, the aramusha rushes him and strikes with its sword, sending Noct off the bridge deeper into the mines below; when he lands, he&#8217;s surrounded by goblins]<br />
Noctis: Great, just great.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(beginning to follow the tracks running through this area of the mines)<br />
Prompto: At least if we get lost, we can follow the rails back.<br />
Gladio: Good point, Prompto. Even you can come in handy.<br />
Prompto: And even you can be annoying!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[As the four climb a sloped area the tracks run along, another mine cart comes rolling toward them]<br />
Prompto: Look out in front!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Back up on the level above, the Chocobros approach a mine cart sitting at a fork in the tunnel; the cart suddenly launches toward them as they get near; the culprit is once again a goblin]</p>
<p>(after killing the daemon)<br />
Prompto: Hmm. It splits off again here.<br />
Ignis: Is this a mine or a maze?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[The Chocobros eventually enter what appears to be an excavation area]<br />
Prompto: Whoa. What do you make of this place?<br />
Gladio: I&#8217;d say good or bad, there&#8217;s something in store.<br />
Ignis: I&#8217;d say &#8220;bad.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[As Noct and his friends encounter the aramusha again in the excavation area]<br />
Prompto: Hey, I remember him!<br />
Gladio: Time to settle the score. Huh, Noct?<br />
Noctis: You bet it is!</p>
<p>[Note by Glenn Morrow: Should the player enter the excavation area and draw near enough to the aramusha to trigger combat without having first encountered the daemon on the trestle, this dialogue will not play]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after defeating the aramusha and the goblins assisting it)<br />
Prompto: Yes! Tough guy like that must&#8217;ve been guarding something sweet.<br />
Ignis: Certainly wouldn&#8217;t be the first time.<br />
Gladio: Have a look around.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Following some tracks up out of the excavation area and through a flooded tunnel, they spot a goblin running from them further up the tunnel]<br />
Prompto: Since when do they run away from us?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Pursuing the small daemon, they come to a gate where it awaits them, just so it can close and lock the gate as they draw near]<br />
Noctis: Since they learned to lock the door behind them.</p>
<p>[The goblin skitters away]<br />
Noct: Come out and fight!<br />
Gladio: See who has the last laugh, goblins.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring the tunnels)<br />
Prompto: This place gives me the chills.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Noct and the others make their way through another flooded tunnel to an elevator]<br />
Gladio: Done here?<br />
Prompto: Wanna check another floor?</p>
<p>(alternate dialogue for coming to the elevator)<br />
Prompmto: Had enough?<br />
Ignis: Head back up?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(inspecting some broken mine carts near the elevator on floor B3F)<br />
Ignis: Ramshackle, to say the least.<br />
Prompto: With plenty of nooks and crannies for things to jump out at you.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(passing through a room with two large fans turning atop a tall platform)<br />
Gladio: Someone&#8217;s a &#8220;fan&#8221; of ventilation.</p>
<p>[After killing some more goblins in this room, they descend a ladder from the platform and soon locate the other side of the locked gate from earlier]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Finding themselves back in the excavation area, they try ascending to the highest point in the area, atop some metal stairs, only to find a dead end]<br />
Noctis: So much for that. Down it is.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Eventually, they locate a narrow opening in a rock wall in the excavation area; they begin squeezing through]<br />
Ignis: The way continues on.</p>
<p>[On the other side, a split in the path going left leads to the door of this area&#8217;s Menace Dungeon; going right leads to the Tomb of the Clever]</p>
<p>(arriving at the tomb)<br />
Noct: Bingo!<br />
Gladiolus: Makes the hassle worthwhile.</p>
<p>[Inside, Noctis acquires the Bow of the Clever]<br />

<p>(completing the &#8220;The Ever Elegant Regalia&#8221; quest)<br />
Cindy: Thanks for the help, Prince! Have y&#8217;all considered becomin&#8217; hunters full-time? Let&#8217;s see. This here&#8217;s for paint, that one&#8217;s goin&#8217; for treatment&#8230; Oh, shoot—I gotta phone Holly. Welp, looks like another sleepless night!<br />
Noctis: Seriously?<br />
Cindy: Got a few folks waitin&#8217; on repairs, so duty calls. Anyhoo, as promised, here&#8217;s your reward! You can slap that decal right on the Regalia. Try &#8216;er out!</p>

Prompto: I can&#8217;t believe Cindy is slaving away all night.<br />
Ignis: She certainly didn&#8217;t seem to mind.<br />
Gladiolus: Sounds like sleep comes second to her work.<br />
Noctis: Helps it&#8217;s her dream job.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(continuing the &#8220;The Aspiring Artisan&#8221; quest)<br />
Dino: There he is! The prince himself. Ya look good!<br />
Noctis: Y&#8217;know.<br />
Dino: Hey, sorry about the whole boat thing. I pulled some strings, but ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; anyone could do after that fiasco at the Citadel.<br />
[Note: The audio here has Dino say &#8220;Hey, uh, sorry about the whole boat thing. I pulled some strings, but ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; anyone could do after that fiasco at the Citadel&#8221;]<br />
Noctis: Forget it.<br />
[Note: The audio here has Noct say &#8220;Ah, forget it&#8221;]<br />
Dino: Done and done. Man, I tell ya, this reporter gig alone ain&#8217;t enough to pay the bills. So I&#8217;ve, uh, been workin&#8217; real hard on the side.<br />
Noctis: Wow.<br />
Dino: Yep. So, you busy?<br />
Noctis: Why?<br />
Dino: &#8216;Cause I need your help! You fetch me some ore, I trade you one of my pieces. Just like last time—badabing, badaboom!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Dino after beginning the &#8220;The Aspiring Artisan&#8221; quest)<br />
Dino: You know where to go, don&#8217;t ya? I&#8217;ll be waitin&#8217;!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Dino again)<br />
Dino: What a relief all those rumors about you gettin&#8217; iced weren&#8217;t true. Otherwise who would I have to fetch gems for me?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Dino once more)<br />
Dino: Youse guys must be beat after all that runnin&#8217; around. Why don&#8217;t ya get a massage before you go?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after beginning the &#8220;The Aspiring Artisan&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />
Ignis: Seems our well-being is less important than his livelihood.<br />
Noctis: And we fell for it.<br />
Gladiolus: Guy&#8217;s got no dignity, but he&#8217;s full of deceit.<br />
Prompto: I don&#8217;t mind helping him—so long as it doesn&#8217;t involve any danger.<br />
[Note: The audio here has Prompto say &#8220;Eh, I don&#8217;t mind helping him—so long as it doesn&#8217;t involve any danger&#8221;]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;The Aspiring Artisan&#8221;)<br />
Noctis receives an unexpected call from Dino, the reporter-slash-jeweler posted in Galdin. He suggests the prince drop by for a friendly chat, but the four friends suspect Dino has more than mere &#8220;mingling&#8221; in mind.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon entering the vicinity of the stone)<br />
Gladiolus: This has gotta be the place.<br />
Ignis: All that&#8217;s left is to find the stone.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon locating the amethyst stone)<br />
Prompto: Time to give &#8217;em the goods!<br />

Noct: More or less.<br />
Dino: Excellent. C&#8217;mon, you oughta be proud of yourself, Your Highness! The work you did today could save lives.<br />
Noct: How&#8217;s that?<br />
Dino: Y&#8217;see, most folks know better than to go out at night. But some people don&#8217;t have a choice—am I right?<br />
Noct: I guess.<br />
Dino: They may not have a choice, but my pieces can give &#8217;em a chance. So hey, how&#8217;s about you give it a try and see for yourself? I&#8217;m a man of my word, so here you go. I look forward to doin&#8217; business with you again sometime, gentlemen.</p>

Noct: Well, at least that makes one of us.<br />
Dino: Touché. So look, I need a hand. Thing is, it&#8217;s too dangerous for your average joe. That&#8217;s where you come in. I&#8217;ll make it worth your while!<br />

Dino: Believe me: if I could go on my own, I would.<br />

Dino: I already told you everything I know. The rest is up to you.<br />
&#8212;</p>

Dino: I tell ya, this raw stones are always in the darndest of places.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after beginning the &#8220;A Stone-Studded Stunner&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />
Prompto: Here we go again.<br />
Ignis: Given our run-ins with him thus far, I doubt this excursion will go unrewarded.<br />
Noct: Yeah, but we&#8217;re still running his errands.<br />
Gladio: Says the guy who agreed to run &#8217;em.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;A Stone-Studded Stunner&#8221;)<br />
Dino again seeks Noctis&#8217;s assistance in acquiring raw stones for use in a new piece. The prince agrees to help the aspiring jeweler by locating the ore he needs.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon entering the vicinity of the heliodor stones)<br />
Prompto: Let the gem hunt begin!<br />
Gladiolus: You&#8217;ll be hunting a long time. Only raw stones around here.<br />
[Note: The audio here has Gladio say &#8220;Hm. You&#8217;ll be hunting a long time. Only raw stones around here&#8221;]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon locating the first heliodor stone)<br />
Noct: Bingo. Found one.<br />
Prompto: Aww, this is it? Man, ore&#8217;s a real bore. Hopefully the next one looks cooler.</p>

Noct: Alright. Just one more stone to go.</p>
<p>Heliodor Stone x 1<br />

<p>(upon locating the third heliodor stone)<br />
Gladio: One, two, three. That&#8217;ll do it. Now let&#8217;s head back.</p>

Noct: They put up a pretty good fight.<br />
Dino: Well, you&#8217;re alive, so&#8230;as promised! That baby right there&#8217;s unlike anything you&#8217;ve seen before. Drop by again sometime and let me know what you think!</p>

Noct: I know what this means.<br />
Dino: So Your Majesty&#8217;s a mind reader. Well? What am I thinking?<br />
Noct: You want more ore.<br />
Dino: Bingo! I think we got a real good thing goin&#8217; here.</p>
<p>(speaking with Dino after beginning the &#8220;Reliable Royalty&#8221; quest)<br />
Dino: I already told you where to go. What&#8217;re you waiting for? Go on!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Dino again)<br />
Dino: I try asking the Hunters for help, and they shoot me down. Guess my stone hunts are too hard for them to handle.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Dino once more)<br />
Dino: Gotta say, having you around puts my mind at ease. Royalty like you know what these rough gems are really worth!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after beginning the &#8220;Reliable Royalty&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />
Gladio: The guy&#8217;s really taken a liking to you.<br />
Ignis: Or at least your generosity.<br />

Noct: You could try setting him a better example.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;Reliable Royalty&#8221;)<br />
Dino asks the Hunters for help securing stones, but they refuse his request. In his desperation, the journalist-cum-jeweler instead implores his trustworthy &#8220;pal&#8221; Prince Noctis for assistance.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon entering the vicinity of the sapphire stone)<br />
Prompto: Hey, we should be able to snag a stone around here, right?<br />

Noct: Thanks for your concern.<br />
Dino: Relax. I knew you&#8217;d be fine—all thanks to my handiwork. You held up your end of the bargain, so I&#8217;ll hold up mine. I&#8217;m proud to present you with one of my pieces. I think you&#8217;ll find it to your liking. If you want more, stop by again!</p>

Noct: Just the old telepathy.<br />
Dino: Yeah, well, read my mind all you like, but I don&#8217;t got a lot to share. None of my associates had much luck looking into the place, so if you can&#8217;t do it, just fuhgeddaboudit.<br />

Dino: Y&#8217;see, I&#8217;m a man with a dream. I ain&#8217;t satisfied makin&#8217; some garage sale trinkets.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Dino once more)<br />
Dino: My apologies about the lack of information. All I can say for sure is that the place is dangerous.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after beginning the &#8220;No Pain, No Gem&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />
Gladiolus: I&#8217;ll tell ya, Dino called in a pretty big favor this time.<br />
Prompto: Yeah, but that&#8217;s not really like him. Something about him felt&#8230;different.<br />
Ignis: More serious than usual.<br />
Noctis: Serious about setting us to work.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;No Pain, No Gem&#8221;)<br />
Hoping to hone his craft, Dino needs another raw gem for use in a new piece. Unfortunately, the stone he seeks can only be found in a danger-laden location, and Noctis once more finds himself taking up the search.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon arriving outside the Myrlwood)<br />
Prompto: Huh. This sure looks like it leads somewhere. You think there&#8217;s something in there?<br />
Ignis: I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s all but guaranteed.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon entering the Myrlwood)<br />
Noctis: Let&#8217;s take a look around.<br />
Prompto: Wow! This place is a jungle.<br />
Ignis: Abundant in not only flora, but fauna as well.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as they begin their exploration of the Myrlwood)<br />
Gladiolus: No telling what&#8217;ll come crawling out of the woodwork. Stay alert.</p>

<p>(upon entering the vicinity of the ruby stone)<br />
Gladiolus: This is the spot. Time to find that stone Dino asked for.<br />
&#8212;</p>

Gladiolus: Not with that attitude.</p>

Prompto: Hey. Somebody&#8217;s gotta do it.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(coming to a fork in the path)<br />
Gladio: Which way do we go?<br />
Ignis: The decision is yours, Noct.<br />
Gladio: Might as well see where both paths lead.</p>

<p>Gladio: Finally, a little breathing room.<br />

Prompto: I was getting claustrophobic.<br />
Ignis: Ought to rest here while we can.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon approaching the haven)<br />
Prompto: It&#8217;s a haven!<br />
Ignis: Shall we rest?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Taking the other path back at the fork brings the Chocobros to a ledge overlooking a small marshy area below]<br />
Ignis: I sense we&#8217;re not alone.<br />

Noctis: Take it you&#8217;re not happy to see us?<br />
Dino: Get outta here. Of course I am! I just can&#8217;t believe youse guys made it back so soon—and with the loot! Here. You&#8217;re gonna love it. Don&#8217;t trust me? See for yourself!</p>

<p>(after completing the &#8220;No Pain, No Gem&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />
Ignis: His creations could fetch a fortune.<br />
Gladiolus: I&#8217;d believe it. Fashionable and functional.<br />
Prompto: And all handmade. The guy&#8217;s a pro!<br />
Noctis: He&#8217;s got talent. I&#8217;ll give him that.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(beginning the &#8220;A Treasure Beyond Measure&#8221; quest)<br />
Dino: Hey. Lookin&#8217; good, Your Majesty. You&#8217;d a—You&#8217;d do me a favor, right?<br />
Noct: You&#8217;d still ask even if I said &#8220;no.&#8221;<br />
Dino: You know it. But this time&#8217;s different: it&#8217;s real important.<br />
Noct: So everything we&#8217;ve done up until now wasn&#8217;t?<br />
Dino: Okay, take it easy there, wise guy. Listen, this is big. If you get me this ore, I&#8217;ll be able to do this jeweler gig full-time.<br />
Noct: Well, whatever makes you happy.<br />
Dino: C&#8217;mon, show me some love! If I get my hands on this stuff, I&#8217;ll be unstoppable. I ain&#8217;t just talkin&#8217; Galdin here. I&#8217;m talkin&#8217; global Dino domination! I&#8217;m gonna be rollin&#8217; in so much gil, the Hunters&#8217;ll be askin&#8217; me to help search for stones! So what I&#8217;m tryin&#8217; to say is, this could be a turning point for your pal Dino—hence, &#8220;real important.&#8221; Unfortunately, this soon-to-be ex-reporter ain&#8217;t got much of a scoop. So, don&#8217;t beat yourselves up if you come back empty-handed. But hey, here&#8217;s hopin&#8217; against hope you come through. Good luck out there, pal!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Dino after beginning the &#8220;A Treasure Beyond Measure&#8221; quest)<br />
Dino: I don&#8217;t wanna send youse guys to your doom, but if you wanna do me one last favor, I ain&#8217;t gonna say no.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Dino again)<br />
Dino: I guess I ain&#8217;t opposed to livin&#8217; out my days as a reporter, but if you can help me get the goods, I&#8217;ll be a changed man.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Dino once more)<br />
Dino: If I gotta give up, so be it. But like they say, it ain&#8217;t over &#8217;til the fat lady sings.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after beginning the &#8220;A Treasure Beyond Measure&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />
Prompto: Guess he wasn&#8217;t kidding about quitting after all.<br />
Ignis: Certainly seemed serious about his aspirations.<br />
Noctis: More than any other time we&#8217;ve met him.<br />
Gladiolus: But the bar was set pretty low.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;A Treasure Beyond Measure&#8221;)<br />
Dino resolves to renounce the journalist life and follow his dream of becoming a professional jeweler. To this end, he must craft a stunning new piece to sell—one that requires an equally stunning stone. Noctis agrees to help Dino launch his career by bringing back the raw gem he needs.</p>
<p>(on approach to Costlemark Tower)<br />
Prompto: Weird building, eh guys?<br />
Ignis: It&#8217;s like no architecture I&#8217;ve ever seen.<br />
Gladiolus: Wouldn&#8217;t want to meet the weirdo who built this.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(when walking across the causeway above the pit at the entrance)<br />
Prompto: It keeps going down, down, down&#8230;<br />
Ignis: Wonder how deep it goes.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[If arriving during the day, with the entrance sealed]<br />
Prompto: Something feels off.<br />
Ignis: They don&#8217;t appear to be your ordinary, run-of-the-mill ruins.<br />
Prompto: I was thinking more &#8220;there&#8217;s no entrance.&#8221;<br />
Noctis: At least not in plain sight.<br />
Gladiolus: Well it doesn&#8217;t look inviting&#8230;so we should probably go in.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while waiting for nightfall)<br />
Ignis: Getting dark.<br />
Gladiolus: Better brighten things up.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(once nightfall reveals the entrance)<br />
Prompto: Check it out, guys—glow in the dark!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(now that they know there&#8217;s an entrance)<br />
Prompto: Knew there was a way in.<br />
Gladiolus: No red carpet, but a stone staircase is the next best thing.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the Chocobros descend the stairs into the ruins)<br />
Gladio: Well, I guess they&#8217;re only closed during the day.<br />
Ignis: Huh? What manner of mechanism is this?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the Chocobros descend the stairs into the ruins)<br />
Prompto: I&#8217;m not scared. My hands are just shaky. Well, that was fun!<br />
Gladio: The fun&#8217;s just getting started. You wanna turn back now?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the Chocobros descend the stairs into the ruins)<br />
Noctis: Let&#8217;s head in.<br />
Gladiolus: Try not to get lost.<br />
Noctis: You get lost.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the Chocobros enter the ruins)<br />
Noctis: Let&#8217;s move.<br />
Prompto: Alright, let&#8217;s go!<br />
Gladio: Hmm. Out of character, but I&#8217;m not complaining.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the first battle with daemons inside begins)<br />
Prompto: Let&#8217;s get fracking! Please, sir! I want some ore!<br />
Gladio: I&#8217;m sure our boss Dino would appreciate your enthusiasm.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the Chocobros begin to explore the ruins)<br />
Gladio: Well, this place is seriously ancient.<br />
Ignis: Indeed. These walls have well withstood the test of time. A stark contrast to the ruins that lie above.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon approaching a narrow ledge)<br />
Gladio: I can make out something over there.<br />
Prompto: I can make out a ledge ready to give if you breathe funny.<br />
Ignis: The risk outweighs the reward.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while crossing the ledge)<br />
Prompto: How sure are we about this?<br />
Ignis: Take it one step at a time.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while examining a balcony)<br />
Prompto: Hey, think we&#8217;d make it if we jump down from here?<br />
Ignis: I can guarantee you&#8217;ll make it down. Whether or not you survive the fall, however, is a separate matter.<br />
Noctis: Let&#8217;s get down there in one piece.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring the ruins)<br />
Prompto: We&#8217;ll go through there. But quietly. Quietly.<br />
Ignis: Best to proceed with caution.<br />
Prompto: I think that applies to you there, big guy.<br />
Gladio: I&#8217;m pretty sure you&#8217;re the klutz.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(coming to a bridge inside the ruins)<br />
Prompto: And what have we here?<br />
Gladio: Dunno, but it&#8217;s huge.<br />
Prompto: I&#8217;m too tired to walk all the way across.<br />
Gladio: We&#8217;ll call it a night here, then.<br />
Prompto: Actually not too tired!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(preparing to cross the bridge)<br />
Prompto: We gonna cross?<br />
Noct: Um, yeah?<br />
Prompto: Knew you&#8217;d say that. Why do I bother asking?<br />
Noct: Dunno. Let&#8217;s go.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(still exploring)<br />
Gladio: Whoa.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(still exploring the ruins)<br />
Gladio: I got a feeling there&#8217;s something below. Give it a quick looksee?<br />
Prompto: If there&#8217;s something there, but no one looks, is it really there?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon locating the emerald stone)<br />
Prompto: Woohoo! Time to pay Dino a visit.</p>
<p>Emerald Stone x 1<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(walking past a side room while exploring)<br />
Gladio: We can&#8217;t get sidetracked for nothin&#8217;. I say we keep moving.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(coming to a large, open room at the apparent bottom of the tower)<br />
Noctis: Really opens up back here.<br />
Prompto: Welp, guess that&#8217;s the end of the road, so&#8230;<br />
Gladio: Not so fast. There might be a way.<br />
Prompto: Or there might not.<br />
Ignis: Well it can&#8217;t hurt to look now, can it?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as it becomes apparent that some of the large cubes in the floor aren&#8217;t just decoration)<br />
Prompto: Whoa, Noct—check this out!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the cube block they&#8217;re standing on begins to sink into the floor)<br />
Prompto: The floor!<br />
Gladio: It&#8217;s moving.<br />
Prompto: Whoa, whoa, whoa—what&#8217;s going on!?<br />
Noctis: Hell if I know!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the Chocobros make their way through the tower&#8217;s cube puzzle)<br />
Ignis: This doesn&#8217;t bode well.<br />
Gladiolus: So, the floor is sliding out that way&#8230;<br />
Noctis: We&#8217;re going down.<br />
Prompto: We&#8217;re going down!?<br />
Gladio: Goin&#8217; down!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the Chocobros return to the large, open room from before)<br />
Prompto: Wait, we made it? We&#8217;re really out? We&#8217;re freeeeee!<br />
Noctis: That&#8217;s overdoing it a bit.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon finding the door to the Menace Dungeon that resides here)<br />
Noctis: No luck. Guess we&#8217;ll need another key.<br />
Ignis: The key question is, &#8220;Where do we look?&#8221;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as yet another cube block Noct and co. stand on sinks)<br />
Prompto: Oh no, oh no! Ah, we&#8217;re trapped down here!<br />
Ignis: The exit&#8217;s sealed off.<br />
Prompto: But we can unseal it, right? Noct? Noct!?<br />
Noctis: How should I know? We&#8217;ll think of something—just chill.<br />
Prompto: Do I seem like the &#8220;chill&#8221; type to you?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as they reach the end of the tower&#8217;s cube puzzle)<br />
Prompto: Oh wait—definitely never been here before!<br />
Ignis: Amazed we made it out.<br />
Prompto: Alright! Take that, labyrinth!<br />
Gladiolus: Wouldn&#8217;t start celebrating yet. We&#8217;re not done here.<br />
Prompto: You have got to be kidding me.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as Noct and co. descend toward the room with the Jabberwock)<br />
Prompto: Uh, guys?<br />
Noctis: So freakin&#8217; creepy.<br />
Prompto: You guys hear that?<br />
Ignis: Now we know what makes this place run.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as they reach the room with the Jabberwock)<br />
Ignis: Yet another grand hall before us.<br />
Gladiolus: Wonder what&#8217;s ahead.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after defeating the Jabberwock, then stepping on the floor switch along the stairway near the entrance)<br />
Prompto: Whoa. Wait. Hold on. Ah, my eyes!<br />
Noctis: Are we back outside?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon returning to the surface)<br />
Prompto: Smell that fresh air—makes you feel alive!<br />
Noct: Yeah, don&#8217;t get used to it.<br />
Gladiolus: Why is everything such a big deal with you?<br />
Ignis: Let him have his fun, while he&#8217;s still alive.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(completing the &#8220;A Treasure Beyond Measure&#8221; quest)<br />
Dino: You did it. You really did it.<br />
Noct: So, you all ready to open up shop?<br />
Dino: Well, I&#8217;m an artisan first and foremost, not a salesman. You know the Ring of the Lucii, right?<br />
Noct: I do.<br />
Dino: That little baby put up a wall strong enough to keep out the daemons and the whole mother-lovin&#8217; empire. How cool is that?<br />
Noct: Pretty cool, I guess.<br />
Dino: Yeah, yeah. See, that&#8217;s the level I&#8217;m aimin&#8217; for. Not this second, of course. I got my sights set a little lower for now, but it&#8217;s only a matter of time.<br />
Noct: Wow.<br />
Dino: Ya probably heard on the news how the nights are growin&#8217; longer and the daemon population&#8217;s gettin&#8217; bigger. People need protection. And if I really give it my all, I think I can provide that for &#8217;em. Here. You ain&#8217;t gonna find anything better in all of Eos, and she&#8217;s all yours. Well, I guess I got my work cut out for me!</p>

<p>(after completing the &#8220;A Treasure Beyond Measure&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />
Prompto: Sounds like we&#8217;ve got a new business partner.<br />
Ignis: And a rather glib one, at that.<br />
Gladiolus: The guy makes Prompto look proper.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(taking the &#8220;Case of the Stolen Specs&#8221; tour with Ignis, which can be triggered by camping at Pectriche Haven)<br />
[At camp, Noct is asleep in his chair by the fire; Ignis takes a seat in the chair next to him, and Noctis comes out of his sleep, rubbing his eyes]<br />
Ignis: Noct, would you mind helping me out tomorrow morning?<br />
Noctis: With what?<br />
Ignis: With whipping together some breakfast.</p>
<p>[A prompt appears to select either &#8220;Sure&#8221; or &#8220;No way&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Sure<br />
Noctis: Sure, if you want.<br />
Ignis: Splendid. Don&#8217;t stay up too late, Noct.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
No way<br />
Noctis: I&#8217;m not a morning whipper.<br />
Ignis: Can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m surprised. Perhaps another time, then.</p>
<p>[Ignis gets up from his chair and walks away]<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after selecting &#8220;Sure&#8221;)<br />
[The next morning, Ignis stands before Noct doubled over and his glasses missing]<br />
Ignis: Noct!<br />
Noct: What&#8217;s wrong? Are you okay!?<br />
Ignis: It&#8217;s not me&#8230; It&#8217;s my spectacles.<br />
Noct: Your glasses? Well, how come they&#8217;re not on your face?<br />
Ignis: I was making ready to leave camp when a black chocobo sidled up—snatched my specs from over my nose, and bolted!</p>
<p>[Noct begins laughing hysterically]<br />
Noctis: Oh, man, that&#8217;s hilarious!<br />
Ignis: This is no laughing matter! We must retrieve them at once!<br />
Noct: &#8220;At once&#8221;? Like, right now?<br />
Ignis: The foul fowl trotted off in that direction. Let&#8217;s move. Sorry to drag you along.</p>
<p>[Noct and Ignis begin heading for the small marshy area of the Myrlwood]<br />
Noct: You&#8217;ve got a spare pair, don&#8217;t you? Just use those.<br />
Ignis: And let a perfectly good pair go to waste as a chocobo&#8217;s trinket? I think not!<br />
Noct: Wha—uh, okay?</p>
<p>[At the marshy area, they spot the chocobo]<br />
Ignis: We have the culprit. There!<br />
Noct: Finally. So what now, Sergeant No-Specs?<br />
Ignis: I brought along a secret weapon just in case: a handful of gysahl greens.<br />
Noct: Nice. So, how you wanna do this?<br />
Ignis: We lure the bird this way. While it gorges itself on greens, you grab the glasses.</p>
<p>Ignis&#8217;s glasses are lying at the roots of a nearby tree.<br />
Sneak toward the tree without being noticed.<br />
Wait until the chocobo takes the bait, and stay still when it looks around.</p>
<p> Stay silent</p>
<p>[Ignis has placed the greens in front of the chocobo, and is trying to keep its attention there]<br />
Ignis: Nice and fresh. Would be a shame to miss out.</p>
<p>[The chocobo stops eating and looks around; Noctis ducks; the bird resumes eating after a moment; Noctis breathes a sigh of relief]<br />
Ignis: Oh, that&#8217;s a good bird! Go on and eat up. You know you want to&#8230;</p>
<p>[The chocobo stops eating again to look around; Noctis ducks once more; the chocobo resumes eating after a moment]<br />
Noctis: Too close&#8230;</p>
<p>[The chocobo stops eating to look around once more, then returns to its food again; as Noctis closes in on the glasses, he and the chocobo repeat this procedure twice more; at last, Noct gets close enough to grab them and does so]<br />
Noct: Gotcha!<br />
Ignis: Away from there, Noct! Quickly!</p>
<p>[The chocobo rushes after Noct, but he manages to escape; he&#8217;s joined by Ignis a moment later]<br />
Ignis: We&#8217;ve shaken our tail. We&#8217;re safe now. Ah&#8230; Something the matter?<br />
Noct: Just realized I&#8217;d never seen your face without your glasses.<br />
Ignis: Yes, well, without them, I could hardly make out yours, but we saw our way through it. And now they&#8217;re back where they belong. Thank you, Noct.</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
[If the glasses weren&#8217;t retrieved, the generic scene that plays after failing on a tour with Ignis follows]<br />
Ignis: Well, you gave a good effort.<br />
Noctis: And it still went wrong.</p>
<p>[Ignis chuckles]<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
[If the glasses were retrieved, the generic scene that plays after successfully completing a tour with Ignis follows]<br />
Ignis: You were a big help.<br />

<p>[After Noctis and the others defeat Loqi]<br />
Cor: Impressive. Seeing you in action puts my mind at ease. It&#8217;s clear I don&#8217;t need to worry any more. I&#8217;ll return to watching the Niffs. &#8216;Til next time, take care.</p>
<p>[Cor and Monica leave; a moment later, Noct and his retinue move toward the open gate of the blockade, Ignis slowly driving the Regalia alongside the other three, who are on foot; Gladio&#8217;s sword is resting on his shoulder]<br />
Gladiolus: Ain&#8217;t so bad out here once you get used to it.<br />
Prompto: Still a lot we haven&#8217;t seen, though.<br />
Ignis: And a lot for us to do.<br />
Prompto: Yeah.<br />
Gladiolus: Buck up. We&#8217;re just getting started.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>CHAPTER 3 &#8211; The Open World</strong></span><br />
The empire is a powerful foe, and Noctis has far to travel before he can hope to reclaim the Crystal. He sets out across new lands in search of the power of his forebears.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(first cutscene of chapter)<br />
Gralea, Niflheim</p>
<p>[Numerous imperial soldiers and commanders stand before the emperor]</p>
<p>Iedolas: So, the prince eludes death. And what of the elusive ring?<br />
Ravus: Lunafreya has absconded with it.<br />
Iedolas: Find and kill her. The ring is the final piece.<br />
Verstael: We may do well to take her alive. The Six wield power beyond our imagination. The Oracle holds the key for the King. She could unlock many secrets, nay High Commander?</p>
<p>[Verstael looks at Ravus; Ravus says nothing]<br />
Verstael: Lord Ravus, the imperial army is now at <em>your</em> disposal.<br />
Ravus: A moot point while the fugitives remain at large. My men and I will continue our search for the prince and the Oracle.<br />
Iedolas: So glorious&#8230;<em>my</em> Crystal&#8230;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the Chocobros ride into the Cleigne region in the Regalia)<br />
Prompto: Look out world, here we come!<br />
Gladio: We can finally leave this dust bowl behind.<br />
Ignis: The lands beyond are vast by comparison to Leide.<br />
Prompto: Bigger&#8217;s better! More stuff to see and do.<br />
Ignis: First comes Duscae, a region known for its wetlands.<br />
Noctis: Really? Wetlands?<br />
Ignis: There&#8217;s also a chocobo forest.<br />
Prompto: Now we&#8217;re talking!<br />
Ignis: Further west lies the Cleigne region, wherein we&#8217;ll find the town of Lestallum.<br />
Prompto: Oh. Isn&#8217;t that where Iris is headed?<br />
Gladiolus: Barring delays, she should&#8217;ve arrived by now. Maybe even had herself a look at the Meteor.<br />
Noctis: The Meteor of the Six?<br />
Ignis: The same. Its heat is harnessed to power Lestallum.<br />
Prompto: Whoa. That sounds way cool.<br />
Gladio: I&#8217;m actually looking forward to this.</p>
<p>[Soon thereafter, they begin drawing near the Alstor Coernix Station; Ignis slows down]<br />
Ignis: It will be a long drive. Best fill up the tank before we set out.</p>
<p>[He pulls the car over at the station]<br />
Ignis: I believe we have a solid lay of the land now. The driver&#8217;s seat is yours, Noct—if you so desire it.</p>
<p>Noctis can now drive the car whenever he wants.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after everyone gets out of the car at the Alstor Coernix Station)<br />
[Noctis&#8217;s phone rings]<br />
Noct: Who could this be?</p>
<p>[He answers]<br />
Noctis: Hello?<br />
Iris: Um, Noct?<br />
Noctis: Iris?<br />
Iris: It&#8217;s really you! So good to hear your voice! Everything&#8217;s fine over here. We managed to make it to Lestallum. We just settled into our new digs. So, yeah. Let me know when you&#8217;re coming so we can meet up.<br />
Noctis: Yeah, will do.<br />
Iris: You better!</p>
<p>[Noctis hangs up]<br />
Gladiolus: Was that Iris? Hmph. Can&#8217;t even call her own brother.<br />
Ignis: In all fairness, yours wasn&#8217;t the obituary broadcast all over Lucis.<br />
Prompto: What about me? She say anything about me?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(beginning the &#8220;Friends of a Feather&#8221; quest)<br />
[After the Chocobros discuss Iris, Prompto taps Noct on the shoulder]<br />
Prompto: Did you see that sign? Chocobos! &#8230;CHOCOBOS!<br />
Gladio: No time for that. Need to get to Lestallum.<br />
Prompto: It&#8217;s still ages away. C&#8217;mon, just a quick visit?</p>
<p>[A prompt appears to select either &#8220;Go to the Chocobo Post&#8221; or &#8220;Go to Lestallum first&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Go to the Chocobo Post<br />
Noct: Sure. Let&#8217;s check it out.<br />
Prompto: Yes! Gonna be awesome!<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Go to Lestallum first<br />
Noct: First things first: Lestallum.<br />
Prompto: Alright, but next time we check out the chocobos!<br />

(quest description for &#8220;Friends of a Feather&#8221;)<br />
Prompto is keen to visit Wiz Chocobo Post in the Malacchi Hills, where the finest chocobos are bred and trained.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(examining a shelf in the Alstor Coernix Station Shop &#038; Café)<br />
Due to road closures,<br />
we are SOLD OUT of Ebony Coffee<br />
for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Noctis: Oh, crap. They&#8217;re out.<br />
Gladio: Can&#8217;t let him see this.<br />
Noct: He&#8217;d be crushed.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(approaching Sania Yeagre at the Alstor Coernix Station)<br />
Gladiolus: Well, if it isn&#8217;t Sania.<br />
Prompto: Hmm? Somebody you know?<br />
Gladiolus: Spoke with her just the once, back at Hammerhead.<br />
Noctis: Now that you mention it, you were chatting someone up.<br />
Gladiolus: She&#8217;s real knowledgeable about wildlife, could teach us a thing or two. Go on and introduce yourself.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(beginning the &#8220;The Professor&#8217;s Protégé&#8221; quest)<br />
[Sania sighs]<br />
Sania: What is it now? If you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;m rather busy at the moment.</p>
<p>[She turns around]<br />
Sania: Oh, it&#8217;s you boys. Wait, who&#8217;re you again? And what do you need now?<br />
Noctis: N-nothing.</p>
<p>[Sania makes a &#8220;Hmm&#8221; sound]<br />
Sania: You&#8217;re saying you distracted me for nothing? This won&#8217;t do, won&#8217;t do at all. Precious seconds down the drain. How am I to make up for them? Of course! You boys can help me!<br />
Noctis: Uh, okay?<br />
Sania: That&#8217;s the spirit! I was just thinking I could use a few extra hands—for catching frogs, to be precise.<br />
Noctis: Wait, what? Frogs?<br />
Sania: Ah, and if you&#8217;re thinking any old frog will do? Wrong! You&#8217;re not getting off that easily. Only the red frog native to Alstor suits my needs. You&#8217;ll need to get knee and elbow deep down at the Slough. With that, I&#8217;ll get back to my work. Remember, it&#8217;s red frogs. And make sure they&#8217;re fresh!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Sania after beginning the &#8220;The Professor&#8217;s Protégé&#8221; quest)<br />
Sania: You&#8217;re combat-trained, I&#8217;d wager. I can tell by looking at your efficient musculature.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Sania again)<br />
Sania: You&#8217;ll find red frogs at the Alstor Slough. Bring me live specimens as quick as you can.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after beginning the &#8220;The Professor&#8217;s Protégé&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />
Prompto: That was&#8230;overwhelming.<br />
Ignis: Let&#8217;s hope it&#8217;ll be edifying as well.<br />
Noctis: How did you manage to talk to her?<br />
Gladiolus: Oh, you know me.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;The Professor&#8217;s Protégé&#8221;)<br />
Gladiolus catches sight of an acquaintance of his, a lively lady by the name of Sania, and suggests that the friends speak to her. No doubt she will have important knowledge to impart upon Noctis.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon catching the first red frog)<br />
Noctis: Alright.<br />

<p>(completing the &#8220;The Professor&#8217;s Protégé&#8221; quest)<br />
Sania: Look at all these lovelies! Thank you, boys. Now my research can spring along.<br />
Noctis: &#8220;Research&#8221;?<br />
Sania: From longer nights to earthquakes, there&#8217;s been a lot of strange phenomena of late. The world&#8217;s out of whack, and there&#8217;s no end to the mysteries that want for solving.<br />
Noctis: Mysteries like frogs.<br />
Sania: Yep. You see, red frogs only appeared recently. We don&#8217;t know what gave rise to the mutation. But this tiny critter could hold the key to the world&#8217;s mysteries in its webbed feet. Fascinating stuff, right? When can you help again?<br />
Noctis: Couldn&#8217;t say right now.<br />
Sania: Well, when you can, you let me know. For now, here&#8217;s a token of my thanks for finding the frogs. You&#8217;ve earned it!</p>

Noctis: Uh, no, we&#8217;re not here to—<br />

&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;The Professor&#8217;s Protégé &#8211; Gigantoad&#8221;)<br />
Sania&#8217;s research into frogs is proceeding apace, but to truly unravel the creature&#8217;s secrets, she also needs to study their bigger, dangerous cousins: gigantoads. Noctis must slay the creature, harvest its oil, and bring it back to the professor.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon acquiring the Slimy Oil after killing a gigantoad)<br />
Gladio: Let&#8217;s hurry and get back to Sania.</p>

&#8212;</p>
<p>(beginning the &#8220;The Professor&#8217;s Protégé &#8211; Wyvern&#8221; quest)<br />
Sania: Hey there. So, by now you must&#8217;ve gotten used to the fieldwork. I think it&#8217;s time you graduated from frogs. It&#8217;ll mean more work, of course, but then you&#8217;ll be exposed to more modes of life. Well worth the effort, I think.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;The Professor&#8217;s Protégé &#8211; Wyvern&#8221;)<br />
In order to have the full picture, a scientist must approach a problem from multiple perspectives. To this end, Sania has her sights set on the wild wyvern, a creature known to prey upon even the enormous gigantoad. A wing from one of the aerial predators will serve her purposes admirably.<br />
&#8212;</p>

&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;The Professor&#8217;s Protégé &#8211; Myrlwood Firefly&#8221;)<br />
In order to continue her frog research, Sania needs an injection of capital, and an article on rare fauna should fetch a high price. The Myrlwood firefly is a suitable subject, and Noctis can aid Sania&#8217;s fundraising by catching live specimens.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon entering the vicinity of the fireflies)<br />
Prompto: &#8220;We&#8217;re in the money, we&#8217;re in the money!&#8221;<br />

&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;The Professor&#8217;s Protégé &#8211; Griffon&#8221;)<br />
An ancient tome is said to contain an account of frogs that lived in the time before time. To raise the funds needed to purchase this rare volume, Sania tasks Noctis with hunting the majestic griffon and acquiring its precious feather.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(completing the &#8220;The Professor&#8217;s Protégé &#8211; Griffon&#8221; quest)<br />

Sania: Oh, it&#8217;s you boys again, back to sweat for science!<br />
Noct: Uh, that&#8217;s not exactly right.<br />
Sania: Your words say &#8220;no,&#8221; but your expression betrays an irrepressible desire to lend a hand.<br />
Noct: What do you need?<br />
Sania: Loads of things. But what&#8217;s captured my interest right now is the legendary rainbow frog. There&#8217;s nary a reliable eyewitness account, and the only clue I have as to their habitat is &#8220;water.&#8221; That&#8217;s it. Useless, I know. But that&#8217;s where we are without the data to narrow down the search. Be that as it may, I can&#8217;t bring myself to give up on the critters. Even if they&#8217;re more elusive than a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, I have my pride as the foremost authority on frogs. And so I leave the search to you! Not much info to work with, though, so you&#8217;ll just have to play it by ear.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;The Professor&#8217;s Protégé &#8211; The Frogs of Legend&#8221;)<br />
The ancient tome Sania purchased yielded intriguing, if scant, information on the legendary rainbow frog. If she could but find some live specimens to study, her name would go down in natural history. As ever unable to refuse the professor, Noctis sets out to find his most elusive targets yet.<br />

Noct: Lucky you.<br />
Sania: Thank you. I had foreseen this, but biology is your destiny. Give up hunting and join me!<br />
Noct: What?<br />
Sania: You burn for the science. How else could you have managed to track down the rainbow frog?<br />
Noct: Yeah, well, I&#8217;m kinda busy.<br />
Sania: Oh, really? All of a sudden? And what&#8217;s got you so busy?<br />
Noct: Uh. You know&#8230;stuff. Royal stuff.<br />
Sania: Royal stuff? Ahhh, the royal theater! Well then, that changes everything. Artsy types just aren&#8217;t cut out for science. What a shame.<br />
Noct: Yeah. A real&#8230;shame.<br />
Sania: It wasn&#8217;t meant to be. But no matter what path you walk, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll walk it well. This is it, then. The final token of my thanks. All the best with theater—I&#8217;ll come see a play one day.</p>

<p>(speaking with Sania after completing her final quest)<br />
Sania: Not right now! Important research.<br />

<p>(overhearing a conversation in the Alstor Crow&#8217;s Nest)<br />
Man (1): Where&#8217;re you off to today?<br />
Man (2): Thought I&#8217;d haul the old girl up to Hammerhead, have &#8217;em take a look under the hood.<br />
Man (1): If you&#8217;re takin&#8217; her all the way out there, it ain&#8217;t under the hood you&#8217;re lookin&#8217; to look.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(arriving at the Wiz Chocobo Post)<br />
Prompto: Now this is what I&#8217;m talkin&#8217; about!<br />
Gladiolus: The kid&#8217;s got it bad.<br />
Ignis: There are worse vices, I suppose.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(beginning the &#8220;The Ever Gleaming Regalia&#8221; quest)<br />
Cindy: Hey, Prince. Could I borrow you for a sec?<br />
Noctis: Lemme guess: another favor?<br />
Cindy: You&#8217;re gonna ask me that every time, ain&#8217;t ya? But as it were, I was hopin&#8217; you might find somethin&#8217; for me.<br />
Noctis: No problem. One of us&#8217;ll do anything for you.<br />
Cindy: And which of y&#8217;all would that be? Anyhoo, I need y&#8217;all to fetch me some fiberglass coating. I asked a hunter to bring some back, but wouldn&#8217;t ya know it? Fella took a break somewhere an&#8217; left it behind. Funny thing is, I ordered it with you boys in mind. If y&#8217;all go fetch it for me, I&#8217;ll throw it on the Regalia for ya.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Cindy after beginning the &#8220;The Ever Gleaming Regalia&#8221; quest)<br />
Cindy: Hunters lead a busy life. These days, they&#8217;re so swamped with takin&#8217; care of varmints and daemons that they sometimes forget the little requests.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after beginning the &#8220;The Ever Gleaming Regalia&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />
Noctis: Who knew the Hunters made deliveries?<br />
Gladiolus: In addition to kicking ass and keeping the peace.<br />
Ignis: With all their duties, it&#8217;s no wonder they lose track.<br />
Prompto: And traveling around in the middle of the night can&#8217;t be fun, either.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;The Ever Gleaming Regalia&#8221;)<br />
The glossy coating Cindy ordered for the Regalia got left behind on its way to the garage. Noctis and his friends agree to find the missing material and finish the delivery.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(when the Chocobros get close to where the coating is located)<br />
Ignis: I suspect the hunter had his rest around here.<br />
Prompto: Then let&#8217;s hurry up and look! Cindy ordered that coating for us, y&#8217;know.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon locating the fiberglass)<br />
Noctis: Hey, look. This has gotta be the stuff.</p>
<p>Fiberglass Coating x 1</p>
<p>Prompto: Bingo! Wonder what it&#8217;ll do. Guess we&#8217;ll find out when Cindy sprays it on the car!<br />
Gladiolus: Feels like we&#8217;ve become Cindy&#8217;s personal errand-boys.<br />
Prompto: Yeah, isn&#8217;t it great?<br />
Ignis: You seem pleased.<br />
Prompto: Nope, honored.<br />
Noctis: Lucky you.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(completing the &#8220;The Ever Gleaming Regalia&#8221; quest)<br />
Cindy: Welcome back! Ya find the place alright?<br />
Noctis: Yep, sure did.<br />
Cindy: No surprise there. Y&#8217;all can hang onto that—that&#8217;s your reward. Spray your car with a coat of that stuff, and it&#8217;ll keep &#8216;er lookin&#8217; spic-an&#8217;-span! Y&#8217;all wanna treat the old girl right, don&#8217;t ya? And nothing feels better than driving around in a clean car.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after completing the &#8220;The Ever Gleaming Regalia&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />
Prompto: Man, I love how passionate Cindy gets when she talks about cars.<br />
Gladiolus: Yeah. It&#8217;s actually pretty cute.<br />
Prompto: What? Dude, could you not?<br />
Gladiolus: Not what?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(beginning the &#8220;The Ever Valorous Regalia&#8221; quest)<br />
Cindy: Well, hey there, Prince!<br />
Noctis: Another favor?<br />
Cindy: You guessed it. Must be written all over my face. Y&#8217;see, one of our regulars tipped me off to somethin&#8217; real special. Little thing called a &#8220;supercharger&#8221;—and a purdy powerful one, at that. You boys wouldn&#8217;t happen to be innerested in one, would ya? Fella snatched it from a scrap car, but didn&#8217;t know what to do with it, so he left it. If y&#8217;all want it, it&#8217;s yours for the taking.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Cindy after beginning the &#8220;The Ever Valorous Regalia&#8221; quest)<br />
Cindy: Used to be able to get around at night if ya had a set of wheels, but less folks have &#8217;em nowadays, since drivin&#8217; sets off the daemons.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Cindy again after beginning the &#8220;The Ever Valorous Regalia&#8221; quest)<br />
Cindy: Some folks scavenge old clunkers for scraps, but ain&#8217;t anyone who can use &#8217;em anymore. Lotta good parts goin&#8217; to waste these days.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Cindy once more after beginning the &#8220;The Ever Valorous Regalia&#8221; quest)<br />
Cindy: Breaks a girl&#8217;s heart to see the roads around here so empty. Times sure are a changin&#8217;, ain&#8217;t they? Guess I&#8217;ve just gotta get with &#8217;em.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after beginning the &#8220;The Ever Valorous Regalia&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />
Ignis: The supercharger comes with Cindy&#8217;s seal of approval. I bet it&#8217;s worth the search.<br />
Prompto: And if we find the supercharger, maybe we&#8217;ll earn her seal of approval, too!<br />
Noctis: You hear this? As if he actually has a chance.<br />
Gladiolus: Let the kid dream.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;The Ever Valourous Regalia&#8221;)<br />
One of Cindy&#8217;s regulars informs her of a discarded supercharger they managed to find. Hoping to install it in the Regalia and improve the old girl&#8217;s performance, she asks Noctis and his friends to retrieve the compressor.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(when the Chocobros get close to where the supercharger is located)<br />
Gladiolus: The part oughta be around here.<br />
Ignis: Salvaged only to be discarded. Let&#8217;s scour the area.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon locating the supercharger)<br />
Noctis: Oh, yeah. This has gotta be it.</p>
<p>Supercharger x 1</p>
<p>Prompto: Well! Let&#8217;s head back and have Cindy get to work! Isn&#8217;t Cindy the best? I mean, she searches high and low for all these rare parts for us to use!<br />
Ignis: Very gracious of her.<br />
Prompto: Man, she must really like her.<br />
Noctis: Less us, and more the Regalia.<br />
Gladiolus: Like I said, let him dream.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(completing the &#8220;The Ever Valorous Regalia&#8221; quest)<br />
Cindy: How&#8217;d it go? Did y&#8217;all find it?<br />
Noctis: Yeah, somehow.<br />
Cindy: That&#8217;s swell! I already checked with Paw-paw. We can install that baby whenever you like. Can&#8217;t wait to soup &#8216;er up and get &#8216;er runnin&#8217;. I bet y&#8217;all&#8217;re really gonna feel a difference! Just gimme a holler when you&#8217;re ready to go.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after completing the &#8220;The Ever Valorous Regalia&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />
Prompto: Did you see the twinkle in her eyes?<br />
Ignis: She sounded eager to get to work as soon as possible.<br />
Prompto: How &#8217;bout now!?<br />
Gladiolus: Again—desperate much?<br />
Prompto: Again—I&#8217;m not desperate!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(beginning the &#8220;The Ever Illustrious Regalia&#8221; quest)<br />
Cindy: Hey, Prince. Got a little favor.<br />
Noctis: Sure.<br />
Cindy: I was hopin&#8217; to fix the older girl up with a new set of eyes. Y&#8217;know, headlight bulbs.<br />
Noctis: Go for it.<br />
Cindy: Might not sound like much, but believe you me, these babies&#8217;ll brighten up your road trip. Woulda been nice if they were mass-produced. Crown City-made&#8217;s hard to come by. Ain&#8217;t barely none left out here.<br />
Noctis: And they won&#8217;t be making any more.<br />
Cindy: Ah, I didn&#8217;t mean to bring up a sore subject. All I mean is it&#8217;s a shame there ain&#8217;t more around &#8217;cause they really are gonna change the way you drive. Now I ain&#8217;t gonna lie, going to fetch &#8217;em will be a bit of a hassle. But I swear, you and your car will be better off with &#8217;em. The old girl&#8217;s designed to keep y&#8217;all safe, and these lights&#8217;ll help &#8216;er keep you even safer. Do it for me?<br />
Noctis: You got it.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after beginning the &#8220;The Ever Illustrious Regalia&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />
Prompto: Was it just me, or did something feel off?<br />
Noctis: About?<br />
Prompto: Uh, Cindy?<br />
Gladiolus: Thought I was the only one who noticed.<br />
Prompto: Oh, I noticed. It wasn&#8217;t her usual &#8220;I got a favor, y&#8217;all.&#8221; It was more, &#8220;Y&#8217;all need to do this.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;The Ever Illustrious Regalia&#8221;)<br />
A hunter tips Cindy off to the location of some Crown City-made headlamps. Assuring Noctis of their quality and utility, Cindy asks the prince to retrieve the lights so she can install them in the Regalia and make the prince&#8217;s journey a little safer.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon locating the entrance to Crestholm Channels on the outskirts of Insomnia)<br />
Gladiolus: Looky here.<br />
Ignis: An unassuming entrance.<br />
Prompto: For entering.<br />
Noctis: Damn right.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the Chocobros descend the ladder into the channels)<br />
Gladiolus: Hey, don&#8217;t go slipping.<br />
Prompto: Man! Love being in dark, cramped spaces. Really great how it just sets off my claustrophobia. No need for a reason—let&#8217;s never stop doing this.<br />
Gladiolus: Shut up before you fall and bite your tongue off.<br />
Prompto: Oh yeah, that&#8217;d be the icing on the cake.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as Noct and his retinue begin to explore the channels)<br />
[Prompto sighs]<br />
Prompto: Are we there yet? Sewers!? I knew I smelled something!<br />
Ignis: Nose out of joint?<br />
Prompto: Well, as long as I can keep it dry&#8230; We&#8217;re not going in the water, right?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the Chocobros explore the sewers)<br />
Ignis: Stay alert. There are likely daemons here.<br />
Prompto: Yeah, if those gory stains on the walls are anything to go by.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[While exploring, they come across a ladder leading to an upper ledge]<br />
Gladiolus: Hey, you wanna take the high ground?</p>
<p>[Upon climbing the ladder, another ledge is visible not far away, with a raised ladder pulled up]<br />
Prompto: If I were there, how would I get to me?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring)<br />
Prompto: Man, all this wetness makes my eyes water.<br />
Ignis: You can add to the rain.<br />
Prompto: Where there&#8217;s water, there&#8217;s treasure.<br />
Gladio: Never heard that one before.<br />
Prompto: Hey, you heard it here first!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Continuing to explore, Noct and the others come across a set of control panels]<br />
Prompto: Oh hi switch! What do you do?<br />
Gladiolus: Open doors?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(attempting to open a gate near the control panel)<br />
Prompto: No good. It&#8217;s locked.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as they proceed further down the sewers in this direction)<br />
Prompto: Hey, look.</p>
<p>[Prompto calls the others&#8217; attention to a catwalk above]<br />
Prompto: I&#8217;ll bet you we can make it up.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as they walk through a shallow channel leading into a downward sloping tunnel)<br />
Ignis: An insistent current.<br />
Prompto: It&#8217;s pulling me under!<br />
Gladiolus: Don&#8217;t lose your footing!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as Noct and the others get close to the location of the headlights Cindy sent them to find)<br />
Ignis: Here we are.<br />
Prompto: Let&#8217;s hope they&#8217;re still intact.<br />
[Note: The audio here has Gladio say &#8220;Hm&#8221; first]<br />
Gladiolus: Let&#8217;s hope we can find &#8217;em.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(crouching to crawl through a passageway near the fast-moving current)<br />
Noctis: Let&#8217;s go.<br />
Gladio: Yep.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Stepping into the channel from before that almost pulled Prompto down, Noctis loses his footing and gets swept away]<br />
Noctis: No!</p>
<p>[Noct lands in a channel in a lower level, and is immediately beset by three gelatin daemons and a yojimbo daemon]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring)<br />
Prompto: Bring out the shiny sword.<br />
Noct: What shiny sword?<br />
Gladiolus: Don&#8217;t you have something that glows in the dark?<br />
Noct: Y&#8217;know&#8230;<br />
Ignis: The power of kings&#8230;reduced to a torch.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring the sewers)<br />
Noct: Ugh, how big is this place?<br />
Ignis: Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d care to find out.<br />
[Prompto groans]<br />
Prompto: So tired&#8230;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[The Chocobros come to a corridor requiring they go either left or right]<br />
Ignis: Seems that a choice is upon us.<br />
Prompto: Noct, you sure about where we&#8217;re going?<br />
Noct: I&#8217;m fifty percent absolutely certain.<br />
Prompto: Then I am one hundred percent unenthused about this!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring the sewers)<br />
Prompto: This place is a-&#8220;maze&#8221;-ing, huh?<br />
Gladio: I&#8217;d laugh if we weren&#8217;t lost.<br />
Noctis: Say no more. I&#8217;ll leave the pathfinding to you from now on.<br />
Prompto: Nah. I&#8217;m more the &#8220;ask for directions&#8221; type.<br />
Gladiolus: Don&#8217;t look at me—not my job.<br />
Noctis: Then that&#8217;s it from the peanut gallery.<br />
Ignis: Keep an eye out for landmarks and we&#8217;ll find our bearings.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(coming across the Moogle Charm item)<br />
Prompto: Whoa. This is really something&#8230;whatever it is.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring)<br />
Prompto: Hey, look. Another ladder!<br />
Ignis: Well out of reach, alas.<br />
Prompto: Anyone that tall really need a ladder?<br />
Gladio: We&#8217;re looking at it the wrong way.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[While exploring one section of the channels, the Chocobros see the nagarani daemon in the channel below them]<br />
Prompto: What!? You can&#8217;t be serious&#8230;<br />
Gladiolus: Don&#8217;t look down.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[The Chocobros come across another downward sloping tunnel]<br />
Ignis: As far as I can tell, this is the only way down.<br />
Noct: Of course it is.</p>
<p>(as they slide toward what reveals itself to be a very big drop)<br />
Prompto: You kidding me!?</p>
<p>[They ride the water slide into the channel below and are immediately attacked by the Nagarani]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after going up a ladder from the ledge where the Nagarani could be seen)<br />
[Noctis groans]<br />
Gladio: Yep, I&#8217;m starting to feel it, too.</p>
<p>[A few feet from here, the royal retinue comes to a very narrow ledge that can only be traversed by carefully leaning against the wall]</p>
<p>(as they make their way across)<br />
Gladio: No place for a slip up.</p>
<p>[After making it to the next safe ledge, they must then walk slowly across a large pipe above the pit below]</p>
<p>(as they make their way across)<br />
Gladio: Man, if monsters were to jump us now&#8230;<br />
Ignis: We&#8217;d be easy prey.<br />
Prompto: Why even say that!?<br />
Noctis: Can we please focus on the task at hand?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon locating the second control panel in the channels)<br />
Prompto: Ooh! Another switch, just asking to be flipped.<br />
Gladio: Do it already.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon locating the third control panel in the channels)<br />
Prompto: This has &#8220;big deal&#8221; written all over it.<br />
Gladio: Go big, or go home.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[One of the switches has a gate nearby that will open the first time; the Chocbros proceed through it and make their way down a dark corridor]<br />
Prompto: The end can&#8217;t be far now&#8230;right?<br />
Gladio: Never say &#8220;can&#8217;t.&#8221;<br />
Prompto: Longest. Day. Ever.</p>
<p>[They soon make their way into a more illuminated set of corridors, where they find another locked gate; Prompto sighs]<br />
Prompto: This one won&#8217;t open either.<br />
Gladiolus: Enough of this!<br />
Prompto: C&#8217;mon, man. Don&#8217;t lose your cool.<br />
Gladiolus: Ha! Says the panicky one.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[As they continue to make their way through the channels, they walk across the catwalk they saw shortly after entering the channels]<br />
Gladiolus: Hey, remember when we were down there?<br />
Prompto: How could I forget?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Soon after, the Chocobros find and open the first locked gate they had encountered in the channels]<br />
Prompto: The locked door from earlier?<br />
Ignis: Indeed. It opens out, but not in.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(entering a small walkway below an upper walkway with a railing)<br />
Noct: Well, not reaching that.<br />
Gladio: There&#8217;s no way to go but forward then.<br />
Noct: Um, which way was that again?<br />
Prompto: The way that gets us out.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[As their exploration continues, they come to a ledge where advancing further requires hopping down to a channel below]<br />
Noctis: One-way ride.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon locating the headlights Cindy sent them to find)<br />
Noctis: You think these are the ones?</p>
<p>Enhanced Headlights x 1</p>
<p>Ignis: Doubtless. Let&#8217;s hurry back.<br />
Prompto: Can&#8217;t wait to see the look on her face. All the advanced gizmos still in the Crown City, maybe we could go and grab some of it.<br />
Ignis: The empire&#8217;s presence makes sneaking in impossible and getting out unthinkable.<br />
Gladio: Especially without the Crystal&#8217;s protection.<br />
Noctis: When this is all over, why don&#8217;t you take Cindy on a little treasure hunt?<br />
Prompto: Yeah. I betcha she&#8217;d really enjoy that.<br />
[Note: The audio here has Prompto add a &#8220;Hm&#8221; sound]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[In the very next room, the Chocobros come across another control panel; upon flipping the switch here, a loud mechanical sound echoes through the corridors]<br />
Prompto: Wait&#8230; Did anyone else hear that noise?<br />
Ignis: As though a latch were released.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Finding one of the ladders from earlier, they descend into the channel below]<br />
Prompto: Hey, the ladder extends!<br />
Gladio: Nice. Now we have a way back up.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Now back down in the lower channel, they take another downward sloping tunnel]</p>
<p>(upon sliding down below)<br />
Noct: Not again!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon finding a previously closed door now open)<br />
Prompto: It&#8217;s open!<br />
Gladio: So, I guess we keep going.</p>
<p>[Sliding down this final sloped corridor, they&#8217;re confronted by the enormous jormungand daemon]</p>
<p>(once they&#8217;ve killed it)<br />
Gladio: And that&#8217;s that.<br />
Prompto: It&#8217;s over&#8230;</p>
<p>[A nearby ladder leads down to the door to this area&#8217;s Menace Dungeon]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(completing the &#8220;The Ever Illustrious Regalia&#8221; quest)<br />
Cindy: There y&#8217;all are! Well—did ya find &#8217;em?<br />
Noctis: Yep. Got &#8217;em right here.<br />
Cindy: Ya do? Oh, thank the Stars. Now, whether you keep usin&#8217; em is up to you, but humor me an&#8217; give &#8217;em a test run first, won&#8217;t ya?<br />
Noctis: What&#8217;s so special about &#8217;em anyway?<br />
Cindy: The bulbs pack a punch. The light they shine&#8217;s so bright, it&#8217;ll have the daemons headin&#8217; for the hills!<br />
Noctis: Whoa, that&#8217;s awesome.<br />
Cindy: Sure is. Woulda been nice if everybody had &#8217;em before the city got walled off. Was about twenty years ago&#8230; Car runnin&#8217; through these parts one night&#8230;all of a sudden the daemons jumped it&#8230; Saw it with my own eyes. Can&#8217;t never forget it. And I can&#8217;t help thinkin&#8217;, if they had these lights, they&#8217;d still be alive. Y&#8217;know?<br />
Noctis: Yeah, I get it.<br />
Cindy: Anyhoo, lemme know when you wanna give &#8217;em a try. And thanks for all your hard work, y&#8217;all.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after completing the &#8220;The Ever Illustrious Regalia&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />
Prompto: Being able to fend off the daemons is huge. These could save lives!<br />
Gladiolus: Especially since not everyone can fend for themselves.<br />
Ignis: Life out here will improve once we reclaim the capital.<br />
Prompto: Yeah. People living out here will have access to all the benefits the Crown City has to offer.<br />
Noctis: We&#8217;ll make this right—for everyone.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(when walking near one of the signs at the Wiz Chocobo Post that say &#8220;Chocobo Racing&#8221;)<br />
Prompto: Oh em gee, guys. They&#8217;ve got chocobo races here.<br />
Gladiolus: Your point being?<br />
Prompto: We have to stay and watch.<br />
Ignis: We have to continue our journey.<br />
Prompto: C&#8217;mon, just a little longer!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(beginning the &#8220;A Behemoth Undertaking&#8221; quest)<br />
Prompto: &#8216;Scuse me. We&#8217;d like to ride the chocobos.<br />
Wiz: The chocobos, huh? I hate to break this to y&#8217;all, but we can&#8217;t permit our birds to leave the post. Not while Deadeye&#8217;s still about. He&#8217;s an uncommonly ferocious behemoth that&#8217;s taken to prowlin&#8217; these parts of late. His scent makes our birds nervous, an&#8217; to prevent accidents an&#8217; tragedies, we have no choice but to suspend rentals. But hold on, now—ain&#8217;t you lads the hunters that&#8217;ve been makin&#8217; a mark? You reckon you could handle the likes of Deadeye? If you could bring the beast down, there&#8217;d be a reward in it for ya. But knowin&#8217; the danger, I wouldn&#8217;t blame ya for sayin&#8217; no.<br />

<p>(new quest description for &#8220;Friends of a Feather&#8221;)<br />
Noctis has taken on the task of putting down the dread behemoth, Deadeye. If the party succeeds, it will be safe to ride chocobos once more.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[As the Chocobros begin making their way into the Nebulawood in search of Deadeye, they hear a vicious growl]<br />
Gladiolus: The hell?</p>
<p>[Looking up, they see first one tree, then a second collapsing among the hills in the distance]<br />
Ignis: Something&#8217;s amiss.<br />
Gladiolus: C&#8217;mon.</p>
<p>[They cautiously head on inside; a number of trees in the area have been snapped; as the four friends make their way, they continue to hear creaking wood and occasionally see falling timber; they soon come into a clearing where they&#8217;re met by a pack of voretooth fleeing from the other direction]<br />
Prompto: Whoa! Look at &#8217;em go!</p>
<p>[Continuing to make their way through the wood, the area becomes blanketed with mist; eventually, they make their way to an abandoned stone structure with an opening and passage through which they can crouch; Noctis begins to lead the way in when they hear growling again]<br />
Gladio: Noct!</p>
<p>[Gladio grabs Noctis and gently pulls the prince back before stepping forward, turning back and holding out his hand to indicate that Gladio will instead take point himself as they make their way in; Gladio slowly and quietly makes his way forward a few feet, then turns back to motion for the others to follow; occasional growls continue; after the group has made their way in about a dozen feet, Gladio turns and stops them]<br />
Gladiolus: Hold up!</p>
<p>[Still growling, Deadeye comes into view through holes in the structure; it&#8217;s clear that the behemoth is blind in its right eye due to some past wound; it seems that it&#8217;s able to smell the Chocobros&#8217; presence, but due to its blind spot on its right side, it overlooks them when it should have been able to see them; Gladio looks at his friends, holds up a finger, closes his right eye and taps his closed eye with his finger]<br />
Gladio: &#8220;Deadeye&#8221;—the name says it all.</p>
<p>[After a few more seconds of observing the massive animal, Gladio motions for the others to follow him]<br />
Gladio: Let&#8217;s move.</p>
<p>[The Chocobros continue making their way forward, but after about ten more feet, Deadeye suddenly seems to know where they are; the friends press themselves against the ground to avoid Deadeye&#8217;s snout as it&#8217;s shoved down into the narrow passageway through which they&#8217;ve been crouching; after a few seconds, Deadeye gives up; he raises his head, roars, turns and stomps away; the four friends continue making their way through the passage and soon come to the exit]<br />
Gladio: Here we go.</p>
<p>(as they make their way through the wood once more)<br />
Gladio: It&#8217;s weak on the right—no eye, no horn.<br />
Ignis: We&#8217;ll stay in range until we can exploit its blind spot.</p>
<p>[Continuing on, they crouch to pass under a fallen tree blocking their path, and proceed]<br />
Ignis: Exercise due caution.</p>
<p>[Before going much further, they come to a fence they&#8217;re able to jump over, then enter a mist-filled clearing of the wood where Deadeye has its blind side to them]<br />
Gladio: We&#8217;ve got the beast in our sights.<br />
Ignis: But no plan of attack. The behemoth should be headed back to its lair, where we can catch it fully off guard.<br />
Noct: Yeah, as long as we stay on guard ourselves.</p>
<p>Follow Deadeye back to his lair.<br />
Do not let him see you, and do not lose the trail.</p>
<p>(after successfully following Deadeye to the gutted and burned-out building in the wilderness that serves as his lair)<br />
Gladio: All in a day&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>[As they round the corner of the destroyed building, Deadeye is visible through the mist on a small cliff a few hundred feet away; Ignis grabs Noctis&#8217;s hand and pulls him to the ground; Gladio and Prompto join their huddle]</p>

Detonate oil drums with Fire to damage Deadeye.</p>

Noctis: &#8220;Fancy camera&#8221;? Ah, right. Yeah.<br />
Wiz: Nice. What d&#8217;ya say to takin&#8217; a picture for me?<br />
Noctis: Of what?<br />
Wiz: A wild chocobo. Purdy li&#8217;l thing lives &#8217;round these parts. But I ain&#8217;t seen her for a whiles now. Startin&#8217; to get worried.<br />
Noctis: Okay. We&#8217;ll check it out.<br />

Noct: Nothing much. He just wants a photo of a chocobo.<br />
[Prompto gasps]<br />
Prompto: Dude, I&#8217;m on it.<br />
Gladio: You made his day.<br />
Ignis: A wild chocobo. I hope we find it soon.<br />

<p>(quest description for &#8220;Where the Wild Chocobos Are&#8221;)<br />
As well as looking after the domestic chocobos of the Chocobo Post, Wiz keeps an eye on the local wild bird population. Noctis offers to take a photo of a wild chocobo to set Wiz&#8217;s mind at ease.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon entering the clearing in the Nebulawood where the voretooth pack was seen during the &#8220;Friends of a Feather&#8221; and &#8220;A Behemoth Undertaking&#8221; quests)<br />

Ignis: Indeed. Let&#8217;s search the area.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[They spot the chocobo]<br />
Prompto: There she is. I&#8217;m on it.</p>
<p>[Prompto snaps the picture]<br />
Prompto: Perfect. Got the shot.</p>
<p>[The chocobo runs off]<br />
Ignis: Now we can head back with the photograph.<br />
Noctis: You&#8217;re sure you got a proper shot?<br />
Prompto: Dude, it&#8217;s me!<br />

Noctis: Is it what you needed?<br />
Wiz: Surely is. Good to see the bird&#8217;s in fine fettle.<br />
Noctis: You can tell just from a photo?<br />
Wiz: I&#8217;ve been raisin&#8217; birds a long time, son. Now, I owe y&#8217;all somethin&#8217; by way of thanks. This here&#8217;s yours—for your own chocobo.</p>

Prompto: Chocobos &#8217;round here have got it good.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(beginning the &#8220;Bird on the Brink&#8221; quest)<br />
Wiz: Good to see y&#8217;all.<br />
Noctis: Something wrong?<br />
Wiz: Well, word jus&#8217; came in, but there&#8217;s a chocobo that&#8217;s ailin&#8217; out there. Would y&#8217;all mind goin&#8217; to take a look-see? I&#8217;d sure like to help the li&#8217;l guy, if I can.<br />
Noctis: Sure. No problem.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Wiz about the quest after beginning &#8220;Bird on the Brink&#8221;)<br />

&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Wiz again)<br />
Wiz: I reckon the bird might&#8217;ve gotten himself injured. We got daemons and wild critters of all kinds &#8217;round here.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with once more)<br />
Wiz: Or maybe the fella ate somethin&#8217; he weren&#8217;t supposed to, and made himself sick.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after beginning the &#8220;Bird on the Brink&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />
Prompto: So we&#8217;re looking for a sick chocobo, huh?<br />
Ignis: It might be prudent to take some medication along, just in case.<br />
Gladiolus: Yeah. Best load up.<br />
Noctis: Sounds like a plan.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;Bird on the Brink&#8221;)<br />
Wiz hears word of an injured chocobo. If left untended, the struggling creature is bound to fall victim to wild predators. Noctis resolves to find the bird and do what he can to help.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon arriving in the weakened chocobo&#8217;s vicinity)<br />
Gladio: This is the spot. Let&#8217;s find him quick.<br />
Prompto: Yeah, need to help the poor guy.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[The Chocobros find the chocobo laying on the ground nearby]<br />

Noctis: There.<br />
Prompto: Ah, what a relief! You take care, now!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as they begin making their way back)<br />
Gladio: If a predator had found him, he&#8217;d have been done for.<br />
Prompto: A real good thing we found him first.<br />
[Note: The audio here has Prompto say &#8220;Uh-huh. A real good thing we found him first.&#8221;]<br />
Ignis: We can take the good news back to Wiz.<br />
Noct: Yeah. He&#8217;s gonna be happy.<br />

Noct: Yeah. He&#8217;s doing better now, moving around.<br />
Wiz: Is that right? Y&#8217;all did me a real good turn today. I owe ya. I don&#8217;t have much I can give y&#8217;all&#8230;but I can give ya this, for your chocobo. It&#8217;s brand-new.</p>

I wanna be more particular &#8217;bout vegetables. Y&#8217;all see somethin&#8217; nice, you bring &#8217;round a bushel, alright?<br />
Noctis: Okay. If we see anything.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Wiz about the quest after beginning &#8220;A Feathery Feast&#8221;)<br />
Wiz: Fact o&#8217; the matter is, gysahl greens are divisive. There&#8217;s folks who love &#8217;em, and there&#8217;s folks who hate &#8217;em.<br />
&#8212;</p>

Prompto: Yeah, it was on FIRE!<br />
Noctis: Surprised Titan&#8217;s hands don&#8217;t burn up.<br />
Prompto: Wait. I thought that was just a fairy tale.<br />
Ignis: Tales of the Six fighting alongside Lucian kings date back to the age of gods.<br />
Prompto: For real?<br />
Noctis: For real.<br />
Gladio: And yet somehow I find it hard to believe.<br />
Ignis: Not all kings are created equal.<br />
Noctis: Yeah, laugh it up.<br />

[Noct and the others come across a man fishing at Neeglyss Pond]<br />
Navyth: If you&#8217;re here for the huntin&#8217;, do it someplace else. I don&#8217;t want you boys scarin&#8217; the fish.<br />
Noctis: You&#8217;re—into fishing?<br />
Navyth: Indeed I am. You, too?<br />
Noctis: Yeah, I fish whenever I can.<br />
Navyth: Well then, a fellow fish nut! C&#8217;mon. Let me show you a good spot.</p>
<p>[The scene transitions to a small pier nearby]<br />
Navyth: Haven&#8217;t seen you around these parts before. First time here?<br />
Noctis: Somethin&#8217; like that.<br />
Navyth: Well. The name&#8217;s Navyth. I&#8217;ve traveled the whole world, just about, lookin&#8217; for new fishin&#8217;. If you&#8217;re as keen as you say, what d&#8217;ya say to a challenge?<br />
Noctis: A challenge?<br />
Navyth: The crag barramundi. Lurks in these waters. Catch &#8216;im, and I&#8217;ll make it worth your while.<br />
Noctis: Okay. I&#8217;ll do it.<br />
Navyth: I like your spirit, my boy.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking to Navyth after beginning the &#8220;Fishing Buddies&#8221; quest)<br />
Navyth: Take your time, my boy. Nice an&#8217; easy, that&#8217;s the name of the game.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking to Navyth again after beginning the &#8220;Fishing Buddies&#8221; quest)<br />
Navyth: If you&#8217;re talkin&#8217; grillin&#8217;, nothin&#8217; beats barramundi. Try it.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(completing the &#8220;Fishing Buddies&#8221; quest after catching the crag barramundi and going back to talk to Navyth)<br />
Navyth: Well, I&#8217;ll be darned. Well, a promise is a promise. Here&#8217;s your prize.</p>
<p>[Navyth holds out a lure to Noctis]<br />
Noctis: You sure?<br />
Navyth: Sure I&#8217;m sure. With that lure, you&#8217;ll be able to diversify—reel in more kinds of fish. And catchin&#8217; things you ain&#8217;t caught before—end of the day, that&#8217;s what bein&#8217; an angler&#8217;s all about. You&#8217;re still wet behind the ears, but you got potential.</p>

[Noct and the others come across Navyth fishing along the River Wennath near Mynbrum Haven]<br />
Navyth: Now ain&#8217;t this a coincidence, us meetin&#8217; up again. You&#8217;re here for the fishin&#8217;? Because there&#8217;s a fine prize skulkin&#8217; in these waters.<br />
Noctis: What prize?<br />
Navyth: The cherrycomb trout. You need more than a good lure to take that wily beggar.<br />
Noctis: Like what?<br />
Navyth: Timing. He only bites at dawn and at dusk. If you wanna catch him, you gotta play the waiting game. You wanna have a go? There&#8217;s another prize in it for you.<br />
Noctis: Sure. I&#8217;m in.<br />
Navyth: That&#8217;s the spirit. You ain&#8217;t afraid of a challenge. That attitude&#8217;ll take you far.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking to Navyth after beginning the &#8220;Fishing, Naturally&#8221; quest)<br />
Navyth: He&#8217;s a carnivore. Likes small fish. A minnow&#8217;s your best bet for the lure.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking to Navyth again after beginning the &#8220;Fishing, Naturally&#8221; quest)<br />
Navyth: See, you&#8217;ve gotta follow his schedule. Fish for somethin&#8217; else while you&#8217;re waitin&#8217; for him to get in the mood.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking to Navyth once again after beginning the &#8220;Fishing, Naturally&#8221; quest)<br />
Navyth: Remember, it&#8217;s morning or evening, or forget about it. He don&#8217;t bite durin&#8217; the day.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(completing the &#8220;Fishing, Naturally&#8221; quest after catching the cherrycomb trout and going back to talk to Navyth)<br />
Noctis: I got the trout.<br />
Navyth: So you did, so you did. Here then. This is for you.</p>
<p>[Navyth hands Noctis a fishing rod]<br />
Noctis: You&#8217;re&#8230;giving me a rod?<br />
Navyth: Not just any rod, either. Your fishin&#8217; world just got bigger, my boy. Good luck with it. You got real talent, so keep up the practicin&#8217; and keep on improvin&#8217;.</p>

Gladiolus: That old man&#8217;s one generous guy.<br />
Prompto: Yeah. Who gives away rods like that?<br />
Noctis: Guess I have no choice but to use it.<br />
Ignis: The joy of meeting a fellow enthusiast can&#8217;t be underestimated.<br />

<p>(completing the &#8220;A Better Engine Blade III&#8221; quest)<br />
Cid: Here she is, yer weapon reborn.<br />
Noctis: Great, &#8216;preciate it.<br />
Cid: Gotta say, that&#8217;s a right old piece you managed to find. Musta been thirty-odd years ago when they was in service over in Crown City.</p>
<p>[Cid gets up]<br />
Cid: Findin&#8217; the right tools for these relics took it outta me.<br />
Noct: Sorry to hear.<br />
Cid: Ah, but while rummagin&#8217; through my stuff, an interestin&#8217; item turned up. Go on, take it.<br />
Noct: What is it?<br />
Cid: A lil&#8217; somethin&#8217; I had loaned to yer old man, during our trip way back when. Reggie loved it so much, he&#8217;d find every chance he could to help me out with it. But when it came time for him to give it back, he scratched some nonsense into it.<br />
Noct: Nonsense?<br />
Cid: Always irked me, so it&#8217;s fittin&#8217; I dump it on the son.</p>
<p>Cid&#8217;s Old Hammer x 1</p>
<p>Prompto: So, like, you got a hammer.<br />
Gladio: And a story to go with it. Not a bad deal if you ask me.<br />
Ignis: An unexpected side of His Majesty.<br />
Noct: Yeah, it is.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon entering Daurell Caverns)<br />
Prompto: Do we have to risk our lives just to make a living?<br />
Noct: When you put it that way&#8230;<br />
Gladiolus: So what? You want to wait for the treasure to find us?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring the caverns)<br />
Prompto: Anybody see any rare, valuable stuff lying around?<br />
Noctis: I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s how this works.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(coming to a rock wall requiring the Chocobros to crouch to proceed)<br />
Gladiolus: Might be able to crawl through here.<br />
Prompto: Sure about that, big guy?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(on the other side of the rock wall)<br />
Prompto: Well, anything?<br />
Ignis: I&#8217;m really not sure what you&#8217;re expecting.<br />
Gladiolus: Maybe you can find it yourself.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(stepping onto a slippery slope and sliding toward some waiting daemons)<br />
Noct: That sucked!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after killing the daemons)<br />
Gladiolus: There&#8217;s something up above.<br />
Prompto: Some scaffolding and a ladder—who put those there?<br />
Ignis: Who indeed. And what was their purpose here?<br />
Prompto: And most importantly, did they leave any loot behind?<br />
Ignis: No way of telling from down here—let&#8217;s press on.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(continuing forward)<br />
Prompto: Spacious studio. Note the high cielings.<br />
Noct: And someone left a light on for us.<br />
Ignis: Not just a light—sunlight. There&#8217;s a hole above.<br />
Prompto: Yes, the skylight! You won&#8217;t find a daemon lair with one of those.<br />
Ignis: So we hope.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after walking through one of the putrid green pools in the cave system)<br />
Noct: Ugh, you see that?<br />
Gladio: Yeah, I&#8217;d say that pool is due for a cleaning.<br />
[Prompto makes a sound like he&#8217;s trying not to vomit]<br />
Prompto: I don&#8217;t feel so good.<br />
Noct: Any idea what it is, Ignis?<br />
Ignis: No, but it appears toxic, so I wouldn&#8217;t recommend sticking around to find out.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(coming to a place where the path branches)<br />
Prompto: Two choices: this way, or this way. Which way?<br />
Ignis: Want to &#8220;weigh&#8221; in?<br />
Prompto: Whaddaya say, Your Majes-tay?<br />
Noct: I &#8220;say&#8221; no &#8220;way&#8221; I&#8217;m letting you blame me for picking the wrong path.<br />
[Prompto feigns gasping]<br />
Prompto: I would never.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(coming to Daurell Stills, the fishing pool in the caverns)<br />
Gladio: Far as this road&#8217;ll take us.<br />
Prompto: Better throw it in reverse.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(continuing to explore the caverns)<br />
Prompto: We sure do spend a lot of time underground. But it still frightens me every time.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(coming to a very narrow passage in a rock wall and squeezing through)<br />
Prompto: Yeah, about this&#8230; Have I mentioned I&#8217;m claustrophobic?<br />
Noctis: Who isn&#8217;t?<br />
Gladio: I&#8217;ve made tighter squeezes. Just gotta push through.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after the Chocobros have been exploring the caves for a while)<br />
Prompto: Wait—did we come from that way, or that way? Uh, Noct, are we lost again?<br />
Ignis: Not lost, merely misplaced.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as they continue exploring the caves)<br />
Prompto: My legs won&#8217;t carry me much further.<br />
Gladiolus: Well, they better. &#8216;Cause there ain&#8217;t no way I&#8217;m carrying you.<br />
Prompto: Better be a shortcut back.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon locating the ledge that leads to the scaffolding)<br />
Prompto: Hey, we actually made it up here!<br />
Gladio: Told you we could do it.<br />
Prompto: Never doubted you for a second.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while walking across the scaffolding)<br />
Prompto: Noct, check the ladder.<br />
Ignis: Could do ourselves a favor and lower it down.<br />
Noct: Would make life easier for next time.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[The Chocobros come to a narrow ledge that requires them to lean against a rock wall and cross slowly; they begin to make their way]<br />
Prompto: Have I mentioned I&#8217;m acrophobic?<br />
Ignis: Don&#8217;t fear heights—fear falling.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Continuing to follow the path, they come to a ledge seemingly leading no further]<br />
Prompto: So, that&#8217;s it? We&#8217;re done here?<br />
Gladio: As far as we can see.<br />
Prompto: Guys, I&#8217;ve got a bad feeling.</p>
<p>[Several daemons, including an iron giant, begin manifesting]<br />
Ignis: You&#8217;re not alone.<br />
Prompto: I should&#8217;ve known it was too good to be true!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(engaging the daemons in battle)<br />
Gladio: I can keep the steel in check.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after killing the daemons)<br />
Gladio: And that&#8217;s that.<br />
Prompto: It&#8217;s over&#8230;</p>
<p>[After killing the daemons, if Noct performed a point-warp to the small wooden scaffold in this area, he can lower its raised ladder to the ground, completing this dungeon]<br />
Noctis: Let&#8217;s go.</p>
<p>[If Noct and the others crouch through the small opening in the wall where the scaffold sits, the door to another Menace Dungeon can be found on the other side]<br />

Takka: There ya are. So, uh, you wanna do me a favor?<br />
Noctis: Sure. What is it this time?<br />
Takka: Another hunt. My cupboard&#8217;s darn near empty.<br />
Noctis: Okay. We&#8217;re on it.<br />
Takka: Knew I could count on y&#8217;all. Good huntin&#8217;!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Takka about the quest after beginning &#8220;Emergency Delivery&#8221;)<br />

&#8212;</p>
<p>(again speaking with Takka about the quest after beginning &#8220;Emergency Delivery&#8221;)<br />
Takka: Sometimes it&#8217;s faster to ask a hunter to bring it direct, than trek to the shops in town.<br />

Gladiolus: Seems to me Takka could do his own hunting.<br />
Prompto: Take his chef&#8217;s knife and DOINK!<br />
Ignis: He&#8217;s no doubt aware of the proper points of separate. Would be quite the carver.<br />
Noctis: Not creepy at all.<br />

Takka has run out of a key ingredient. Unless something is done, he won&#8217;t be able to serve his diner&#8217;s meat specials. Noctis and his friends go off to hunt for the meat Takka needs.<br />

Takka: Y&#8217;all really came through. Now I&#8217;ve got enough stock for weeks.<br />
Noctis: How come you don&#8217;t do your own hunting?<br />
Takka: Did a little when I was a young&#8217;un. Chased down folks, beggin&#8217; &#8217;em for food with nothin&#8217; but my knife. But that was no life. Ever since Cid came and bailed me out&#8230; I only ever use my knife in the kitchen. This here&#8217;s for y&#8217;all. It&#8217;ll fill ya up, and taste good goin&#8217; down.</p>

Takka: Somethin&#8217; nasty&#8217;s holdin&#8217; up my supplier, so now I&#8217;m runnin&#8217; low on beans.<br />
Noctis: Beeeans?<br />
Takka: Don&#8217;t like &#8217;em?<br />
Noctis: Not so much.<br />
Takka: That&#8217;s &#8217;cause you ain&#8217;t never had &#8217;em cooked right. I simmer &#8217;em long an&#8217; slow. Leastways, when I have &#8217;em. I&#8217;d be real grateful if y&#8217;all would help.<br />

Takka: What about greens? You hate them, too?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(once more speaking with Takka about the quest after beginning &#8220;Everyone Loves Beans&#8221;)<br />

Prompto: Like, it doesn&#8217;t amount to a hill of beans?<br />
Noctis: I&#8217;m glad you think this is funny.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;Everyone Loves Beans&#8221;)<br />
Takka is running low on ingredients again. Noctis agrees to drive away the beasts that are blocking the supply route, and deliver the beans to Takka&#8217;s Pit Stop.<br />

Takka: Good news: all my deliveries finally came in.<br />

Gladiolus: The man just assumes we&#8217;ll do his errands for him.<br />
Ignis: We&#8217;re indebted to Takka and his diner. Anything we can do, we should.<br />
Noctis: Yeah. It&#8217;s just shopping. No biggie.<br />
Prompto: What could be easier? Let&#8217;s get to it!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;Lestallum&#8217;s Finest&#8221;)<br />
An important ingredient is available only in the thriving market town of Lestallum. Takka is too busy to make the trip, so he requests Noctis to go in his stead.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(completing the &#8220;Lestallum&#8217;s Finest&#8221; quest)<br />
Takka: Well, look at all that. You boys brought back a whole truckload!<br />
Noctis: I took as much as I could carry.<br />
Takka: How much?<br />
Noctis: Nothing.<br />
Takka: Whoa. Now, y&#8217;all didn&#8217;t pull a heist, did ya?<br />
Noctis: No. You think I&#8217;m a thief?<br />
Takka: Forgive me, son. Just reminded me of my own past is all. Musta been thirty years ago. Once tried to steal food from here—&#8217;til ol&#8217; Cid done caught me. Rapped me right on the noggin an&#8217; took me in. This here&#8217;ll keep ya fed, so, uh, you won&#8217;t have to steal.</p>

Ignis: Yes. Less discerning chefs might settle for comparable local flavors.<br />
Prompto: But not Takka. Maybe they&#8217;re for a new dish?<br />

<p>(beginning the &#8220;A Meat Most Magnificent&#8221; quest)<br />
Takka: Hey there.<br />
Noctis: Hey.<br />
Takka: Y&#8217;all got spare time?<br />
Noctis: A hunt?<br />
Takka: Yep. An&#8217; it&#8217;s a dangerous one.<br />
Noctis: Do you need it?<br />
Takka: Sure do.<br />
Noctis: Then we&#8217;ll do it.<br />
Takka: Thanks, son.<br />

Gladiolus: You two are like old buddies now.<br />
Prompto: It&#8217;s like you&#8217;ve got a bond that doesn&#8217;t need words.<br />
Ignis: I suspect you&#8217;ve built an unspoken trust.<br />
Noctis: More of a &#8220;saying the same thing&#8221; trust.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;A Meat Most Magnificent&#8221;)<br />
As usual, Takka is looking for new ingredients, but the beast he wants hunted is quite the fearsome foe. Noctis and his friends agree to slay the massive catoblepas and bring back its meat.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(completing the &#8220;A Meat Most Magnificent&#8221; quest)<br />
Takka: So y&#8217;all got what I asked for. Tell me now. Do you boys like steak?<br />
Noct: You bet!<br />
Takka: Good. Y&#8217;see, the last few jobs I gave you, they weren&#8217;t from Cid—they were from me. And I reckon you deserve somethin&#8217; by way of thanks. So I&#8217;m fixin&#8217; to create a whole new recipe in your honor. A heartfelt token of my &#8216;preciation.<br />
Noctis: Well, I&#8217;m flattered.<br />
Takka: So y&#8217;all make sure ya order it next time you&#8217;re around.<br />
Noctis: Guess it won&#8217;t be on the house, then.<br />
Takka: Any-hoo. This is yer pay for the hunt. It&#8217;s good eatin&#8217;. Take it from me.</p>

Prompto: Yeah, but it was fun. Every day&#8217;s fun. Even when we almost get ourselves killed. I never imagined it&#8217;d work out like this. That I&#8217;d get to go on an adventure with you guys.<br />
Noctis: Who would&#8217;ve thought, huh?<br />
Prompto: So, how long have we been friends now? Let&#8217;s see&#8230;beginning of high school&#8230;so that&#8217;s&#8230;five years?<br />
Noctis: Yeah, but we&#8217;ve known each other way longer than that. Ever since elementary school, right?<br />
Prompto: Huh? You still remember that?<br />
Noctis: Could hardly forget being gawked at.<br />
Prompto: Well, y&#8217;know, it isn&#8217;t exactly easy being in the presence of royalty.<br />
Noctis: And when we did meet in high school, you pretended it was the first time.<br />
Prompto: Yeah, the first time I worked up the nerve to say something. Feels just like yesterday.<br />
Noctis: You should&#8217;ve said something sooner.<br />

Well, I&#8217;m impressed. Constantly watching out for your friends like that, it takes something special. And that something special defines who you are.<br />
Prompto: So you really think I&#8217;m doing okay?<br />
Noct: Yeah, I do. Anything else?<br />
Prompto: Uh, no. Nothing at all. I&#8217;m sorry I got so real all of a sudden.<br />

Behind all the quips and laughs, I&#8217;m a mess of hang-ups. I&#8217;ve always felt inferior to you guys. I&#8217;m not royalty and I&#8217;m not strong. I&#8217;m nothing, really. Unlike Gladio, I&#8217;m not good with people. The way he connects with them, he&#8217;s operating on a different level. Unlike Ignis, I&#8217;m not smart and I can&#8217;t cook to save myself. But when we hang out, it&#8217;s so much fun I forget what I&#8217;m not. Then reality hits me like a splash of cold water, and I remember that I don&#8217;t belong. But I want to. Every moment, I&#8217;m desperate to earn my place—to prove that I&#8217;m good enough.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned vintage filter is now available.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
[If the player waits to strike the pose once the catoblepas is close enough]<br />
Prompto: Alright, takin&#8217; it! Strike a pose!</p>
<p>[Prompto takes the picture]<br />
Prompto: Got it! Get outta there, Noct!</p>
<p>[Noctis and Prompto then either flee from the catoblepas to a particular spot a great distance away or they end up fighting the enormous animal when it comes close; regardless of which outcome the player goes with, Prompto and Noct then have the following exchange]<br />
Noct: Should be safe here&#8230;</p>
<p>[Prompto catches up, laughing hysterically]<br />
Noct: Hey, what are you laughing at? I could&#8217;ve died!<br />
Prompto: But we got the perfect shot and had ourselves some crazy fun! Oh man, you should&#8217;ve seen your face. Wish I&#8217;d snapped that, too!<br />
Noct: Prompto&#8230;<br />
Prompto: C&#8217;mon, you know you had a blast! And I totally leveled up my photography skill!</p>
<p>The old-fashioned vintage filter is now available.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Back at camp]<br />
Prompto: Alright, mission accomplished!<br />
Noctis: Thanks to who?<br />
Prompto: My hero, Noct.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(taking the &#8220;The Chopping Block&#8221; tour with Ignis, which can be triggered by camping at Fallaughns Haven)<br />
[Note by Glenn Morrow: If the player has not yet completed the &#8220;Stirred, Not Shaken&#8221; tour with Ignis, the exchange(s) they share at camp to begin or turn down this tour will be the same as in that case; similarly, if the player should complete this tour before beginning &#8220;Stirred, Not Shaken&#8221; at Cotisse Haven, the opening exchanges recorded below will appear there instead]</p>
<p>[At camp, Noct is asleep in his chair by the fire; Ignis takes a seat in the chair next to him, and Noctis comes out of his sleep, rubbing his eyes]<br />
Ignis: Noct, a moment?<br />
Noctis: Yeah?<br />
Ignis: I&#8217;ve a favor to ask. It requires a slightly early start.<br />
Noctis: Not making any promises.</p>
<p>[Noct sighs]<br />
Noctis: What is it?<br />
Ignis: I was hoping you would help prepare breakfast again.</p>
<p>[A prompt appears to select either &#8220;Sure&#8221; or &#8220;No way&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Sure<br />
Noctis: Again? Yeah, why not?<br />
Ignis: Excellent. Until tomorrow, then.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
No way<br />
Noctis: Wake me when it&#8217;s ready instead.<br />
Ignis: I&#8217;ll see what I can do, but&#8230; Not making any promises.</p>
<p>[Ignis gets up from his chair and walks away]<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after selecting &#8220;Sure&#8221;)<br />
Your friend has invited you on a tour.<br />
Join him at dawn tomorrow to undertake a special task.<br />
You must remain in the vicinity of your destination.</p>
<p>[In the morning]<br />
Ignis: Can you cut vegetables?<br />
Noct: Can you be a little more specific?<br />
Ignis: Finely will do just fine.</p>
<p>[Ignis cooks on the grill while Noct prepares to chop vegetables next to him]</p>
<p>Press ○ to chop the vegetables while talking with Ignis.<br />
Chop as finely as you can.</p>
<p>Ignis: No trouble handling the knife?<br />
Noct: Of course not. I cut things up all the time.<br />
Ignis: Ingredients are rather different beasts. The blade should give you &#8220;paws&#8221;—a cat&#8217;s paw with the left while you slice with the right.<br />
Noct: I know that. Don&#8217;t make me claw your throat out.</p>
<p>[Ignis points]<br />
Ignis: Chop these as well.<br />
Noct: No prob.</p>
<p>Continue chopping vegetables with ○ while you talk with Ignis.</p>
<p>Noct: Say, Ignis. How come you like cookin&#8217; so much?<br />
Ignis: I find the true joy of cooking on the faces of those for whom I cook.<br />
Noct: Huh.<br />
Ignis: I&#8217;ll never forget the smile on your face the first time I cooked for you.<br />
Noct: I barely remember what I ate yesterday. Well, whatever that first meal was&#8230; I&#8217;m sure it was pretty good.</p>
<p>[Ignis looks over to see Noct&#8217;s results]<br />
Ignis: And now, the moment of truth.</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
[If the chopping was done improperly]<br />
Ignis: Oh&#8230;<br />
Noct: What?<br />
Ignis: Your chopping was rather rough. It&#8217;ll take time to cook and even longer to eat. I know you dislike vegetables, but I hope you didn&#8217;t intentionally cut corners. No matter. I&#8217;ll take it from here.<br />
Noct: Sorry &#8217;bout that.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
[If the chopping was done properly]<br />
Ignis: Excellent work.<br />
Noct: You think so?<br />
Ignis: I do. You chopped the vegetables to perfection.<br />
Noct: Yep! Told you I&#8217;d cut &#8217;em down to size.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[After they&#8217;ve finished]<br />
Ignis: So, did you enjoy fixing food for everyone?<br />
Noct: Yeah, but I definitely couldn&#8217;t get up and do it every day like you. Thanks.<br />
Ignis: I must say, I never envisioned the two of us chatting about cooking.<br />
Noct: Yeah, neither did I.<br />
Ignis: Seeing how you love fishing, you should learn how to prepare your catch.<br />
Noct: Then I could have fresh fish any time.<br />
Ignis: Same time tomorrow, then?<br />
Noct: Not a chance.</p>
<p>[Whether the chopping was done properly or improperly, the generic scene that usually plays after successfully completing a tour with Ignis follows]<br />
Ignis: You were a big help.<br />
Noct: Yeah, I&#8217;m good like that.<br />
Ignis: Right.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing a conversation at a scrapyard near the depot in the Coernix Bypass area)<br />
Woman (1): All that smoke&#8230; Is it coming from the volcano?<br />
Woman (2): Probably. Ravatogh&#8217;s supposed to be active, after all.<br />
Woman (1): It won&#8217;t erupt all of a sudden?<br />
Woman (2): For all we know, it&#8217;s about to blow its top.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring)<br />
Ignis: Noct, we should make haste for Lestallum.<br />
Gladio: Yeah, don&#8217;t keep my sister waiting.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing an NPC in Lestallum)<br />
Man: Been a lot of tremors lately. Hope the rocks around here haven&#8217;t been shaken loose.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing an NPC in Lestallum)<br />
Man: Ravatogh, that&#8217;s a proper mountain. One day, I&#8217;m gonna climb it.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing a conversation in Lestallum)<br />
Man (1): People actually ride here all the way from the Chocobo Post. Must be tough.<br />
Man (2): Damn right! Half that distance, and my rear&#8217;s already riddled with sores.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing a conversation in Lestallum)<br />
Man (1): I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; hungry. Want to grab a bite on the street?<br />
Man (2): I don&#8217;t know. Pretty rowdy at this hour, what with all the women coming off their shifts.<br />
Man (1): Well, if you want quiet, we could always go to a back-alley joint.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(overhearing a conversation in Lestallum)<br />
Man (1): Carnival season&#8217;s comin&#8217; up. We could open shop in Altissia—make a quick gil.<br />
Man (2): The likes of us in the middle of all that fanciness and foppery? Not sure how I feel about that.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring Lestallum)<br />
Gladio: The women here are built.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring Lestallum)<br />
Ignis: A charming town, if a little warm for my tastes.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring Lestallum)<br />
Noctis: So many stalls here.<br />
Prompto: All full of foods I&#8217;ve never eaten!<br />
Ignis: The aroma is indeed tantalizing. I&#8217;m detecting a rather unique blend of spices.<br />
Noctis: Your nose knows everything.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring Lestallum)<br />
Prompto: Everyone here&#8217;s so stylish, and we&#8217;re stuck in drab old black.<br />
Gladiolus: Why not try wearing your official Lucian battle gear with pride?<br />
Ignis: You might even become a real trendsetter around here.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(when approaching the EXINERIS Power Plant in Lestallum for the first time)<br />
Gladiolus: Never seen anything like that in the Crown City.<br />
Prompto: Looks like a factory. What do you think they make?<br />
Ignis: Energy. This plant produces enough power to serve the entire region.<br />
Prompto: Wow.<br />
&#8212;</p>

<p>(as Noct and the royal retinue reach the courtyard outside the Leville Hotel in Lestallum)<br />
[The ground begins shaking]<br />
Noctis: Whoa, do you feel that?<br />
Gladio: You mean the earthquake?</p>
<p>[At the same time, Noct grabs his head and winces; he sees visions of Titan; after a moment, the visions abate and Noct shakes the experience off]<br />
Gladio: What&#8217;s wrong?<br />
Noct: My head just started throbbing.<br />
Prompto: You alright?<br />
Noct: Yeah, I&#8217;m fine.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Noct and his retinue arrive at the Leville Hotel in Lestallum; while they stand in the lobby, Iris comes down the stairs]<br />
Iris: Gladdy!<br />
Gladio: Iris.<br />
Iris: Look at you guys, holding your own out there.<br />
Prompto: What can I say? You look good.<br />
Iris: All things considered. You guys are staying here, right?<br />
Ignis: That&#8217;s the plan.<br />
Gladio: When you have time, we have catching up to do.<br />
Iris: Sure.</p>
<p>[The scene transitions to a hotel room upstairs; an old man and a young boy are also with them there]<br />
Gladio: Jared and Talcott! Is it good to see you.<br />
Talcott: Prince Noctis! Iris is safe with me!<br />
Jared: Please excuse my grandson. He has yet to learn his manners.<br />
Noctis: I like it.<br />
Jared: Your Highness is very kind, but we shan&#8217;t impose. A very good night to you, Your Highness.</p>
<p>[Jared and Talcott leave; Iris closes the door; she and the Chocobros then all take a seat]<br />
Noct: So Iris, what was it like inside the Crown City?<br />
Iris: Not pretty. The Citadel took a beating. But a lot of outlying neighborhoods made it through in one piece.<br />
Ignis: The empire had tactical targets in mind.<br />
Iris: You know if there&#8217;s anything else, you can ask me.<br />
Noct: Yeah, uh, thanks.<br />
Iris: So&#8230;about Lady Lunafreya. I keep hearing she was in town. Apparently she left right away, but at least it means she&#8217;s okay.<br />
Noct: Good to hear. Thanks.</p>
<p>[Iris stands]<br />
Iris: Yeah, well, get a good night&#8217;s rest.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>The next morning&#8230;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Iris is waiting for Noct when the lobby he gets up]<br />
Iris: Morning, sleepyhead!<br />
Noct: Mornin&#8217;. Where is everyone?<br />
Iris: Oh, they&#8217;re out walking with Talcott. They went to see the sights. We should, too!</p>
<p>[A prompt appears to select either &#8220;Accept&#8221; or &#8220;Decline&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Accept<br />
Noct: Sure, why not?<br />
Iris: Great! I&#8217;ll show you around!</p>
<p>Earned 200 EXP.</p>
<p>Jared: It seems your patience was rewarded. Enjoy your walk, and please take care.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Decline<br />
Noct: I need some more shut-eye.<br />
Iris: More!?</p>
<p>Earned 2 AP.</p>
<p>Jared: It may be a good idea to take in the sights while housekeeping cleans your room.<br />
Iris: Yes, that&#8217;s exactly right. C&#8217;mon, I&#8217;ll show you around!<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>Iris: For our first stop, we&#8217;ll check out the marketplace. Follow me, right this way.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(along the way)<br />
Iris: It&#8217;s even more beautiful out here at night.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after following Iris to the marketplace)<br />
Iris: This is the Partellum Market. You can get almost anything here. Isn&#8217;t it great? I&#8217;d buy out the whole place if I could.</p>
<p>[A prompt appears to select either &#8220;Act uninterested&#8221; or &#8220;Act interested&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />

Act interested<br />
Noct: All these shops seem right up your alley.<br />
Iris: You know me so well.</p>

&#8212;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while following Iris around the marketplace)<br />
Iris: Wow! Look at all this neat stuff! I&#8217;m gonna take a look, gimme just a sec.</p>
<p>[The screen briefly fades to black]<br />
Iris: Done! Next, we&#8217;re gonna see the power plant.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(outside the power plant)<br />
Iris: That&#8217;s the power plant, the driving force behind Lestallum&#8217;s prosperity. But get this: only women work there. As a matter of fact, women are the ones who do all the work in this town.</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
Encourage her<br />
Noct: Sounds like your kind of place. I can see you doing well here.<br />
Iris: I think so, too! It&#8217;s so different from home. I was surprised at first. But I like it!</p>
<p>Earned 250 EXP.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Express concern<br />
Noct: Sounds like a hard life.<br />
Iris: I think it&#8217;s kinda cool, actually. Depends on how you look at it, I guess.</p>
<p>Earned 2 AP.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>Iris: Alright! Next, we&#8217;re going to the outlook!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(along the way)<br />
Iris: I&#8217;m a city girl, but I dig the rustic charm.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as they pass a restaurant near the main thoroughfare)<br />
Iris: You would totally love the drinks in this place.<br />
Noct: Would I?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as they pass one of the older style cars parked in the area)<br />
Iris: Imagine taking one for a spin?<br />
Noct: Oh, yeah.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(when they arrive at the outlook)<br />
Iris: Pegglar Outlook. Amazing view, right? Look! There&#8217;s the Meteor!</p>
<p>[Iris suddenly bounds up close to Noctis and lays her head on his shoulder]<br />
Iris: Y&#8217;know, Noct, this almost feels like a date.</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
Deny the suggestion<br />
Noct: What? No. Not at all.</p>
<p>[Noctis waves his hand, as if waving the suggestion away]</p>
<p>Iris: Would it kill you to play along for once?</p>
<p>Earned 300 EXP.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Make light of the subject<br />
Noct: If it were, your brother would kick my ass.<br />
[Iris laughs]<br />
Iris: We better keep it quiet then. And besides, you already have Lady Lunafreya.</p>
<p>Earned 2 AP.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[The two stand silently for a moment, looking at the Meteor]<br />
Iris: The others are probably back at the hotel by now. Let&#8217;s join them.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(back in the courtyard outside the Leville)<br />
Iris: Let&#8217;s see if the others are back. Haven&#8217;t had fun like this since we were kids. Thanks, Noct.</p>
<p>[A prompt appears to select either &#8220;Agree with Iris,&#8221; &#8220;Make light of the subject&#8221; or &#8220;Change the subject&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Agree with Iris<br />
Noct: No sweat. I had fun, too.<br />
Iris: You did? I&#8217;m so happy to hear that.</p>
<p>Earned 500 EXP.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Make light of the subject<br />
Noct: It&#8217;s hard work, babysitting. Better bring the fellas next time.<br />
Iris: What do you mean &#8220;babysitting&#8221;? Talk about ungrateful!</p>
<p>Earned 2 AP.<br />

Noct: I was wondering, what was it you bought today?<br />
Iris: You did always notice the little things. Been like that since you were little.</p>
<p>Elixir x 1<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>Iris: Anyway, the thing I bought today&#8230; It&#8217;s for you. But! It&#8217;s a surprise, so you&#8217;re gonna have to wait.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(back in the lobby of the Leville)<br />
Prompto: Hey, look who&#8217;s back! Talcott, go on and tell &#8217;em what you told me.<br />
Talcott: You got it!<br />
Jared: Oh, come now, show some respect.<br />
Prompto: Whoa, no need to respect me—I&#8217;m not royalty.<br />
Talcott: So, there&#8217;s this legend about a sword. And the sword&#8217;s supposed to be behind a waterfall nearby.<br />
Ignis: It may well be one of the lost tombs.<br />
Prompto: Check it out?<br />
Noct: For sure. Thanks for the tip, Talcott.<br />
Talcott: You&#8217;re welcome!</p>
<p>[Note: If the player has already visited the Greyshire Glacial Grotto and acquired the Swords of the Wanderer, this dialogue will instead take the form immediately below]<br />
Prompto: Hey, look who&#8217;s back! Talcott, go on and tell &#8217;em what you told me.<br />
Talcott: You got it!<br />
Jared: Oh, come now, show some respect.<br />
Prompto: Whoa, no need to respect me—I&#8217;m not royalty.<br />
Talcott: That sword you found behind the waterfall? It is the same sword as the one from the legend in this town!<br />
Ignis: It appears the power of kings made its way into local folklore.<br />
Gladiolus: That makes you a living legend, eh?<br />
Noctis: Yeah. Thanks for the story, Talcott.<br />
Talcott: You&#8217;re welcome!</p>
<p>[Note: At this point, having already acquired the Swords of the Wanderer, the scene of Noctis&#8217;s headache suddenly emerging once more will be triggered, as seen at approximately 9:06 in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWyyVtLpiqc">this video</a>]<br />

<p>(speaking to Jared before departing)<br />
Jared: I shall pray for your safety and success.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking to Jared again)<br />
Jared: Talcott is ever outgoing, and he readily mingles with the locals.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking to Jared once again)<br />
Jared: Do take care out there.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking to Talcott before departing)<br />
Talcott: I&#8217;m sure the sword&#8217;s there. I&#8217;m sorry if it isn&#8217;t.<br />

<p>(speaking to Talcott again)<br />
Talcott: Everybody here knows the legend, even grown-ups!<br />

<p>(speaking to Talcott once more)<br />
Talcott: Maybe you&#8217;ll find some cool treasure.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking to Iris before leaving)<br />
Iris: This sounds dangerous. Will the four of you be alright?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking to Iris again)<br />
Iris: Be on the lookout for daemons. They like dark places, after all.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking to Iris once again)<br />
Iris: If there&#8217;s trouble, use Gladdy as a meat shield.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(discussing Talcott while walking about Lestallum after he tells the Chocobros of the local legend of a sword behind a waterfall)<br />
Ignis: Certainly not your average little boy.<br />
Gladiolus: A little bit too much brass for that.<br />
Prompto: That&#8217;s how I imagine you used to be, Iggy.<br />
Ignis: I wasn&#8217;t, I assure you.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(discussing Talcott further)<br />
Prompto: You sure you weren&#8217;t like that kid, Iggy?<br />
Ignis: Very, positively sure.<br />
Gladiolus: Hmm&#8230; What was he like?<br />
Noctis: Can&#8217;t seem to recall&#8230;<br />
Gladiolus: Well, can&#8217;t be too different from now.<br />
Noctis: Sounds right.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring)<br />
Ignis: Iris is truly a caring soul.<br />
Noctis: Like you. No wonder you get along like wildfire.<br />
Ignis: We do have much in common. Like our tales of picking up after the prince.<br />
Noctis: Glad I could be of service.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring)<br />
Noctis: Man, that hurts.<br />
Ignis: Another headache?<br />
Gladio: This is not normal.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring)<br />
Gladio: So when the ground shakes, your brain aches?<br />
Noctis: Yeah.<br />
Ignis: A sort of seismic shock to the system. Curious.<br />

<p>(when the Chocobros locate the waterfall from the legend)<br />
Prompto: The legend says to look behind the waterfall.<br />
Ignis: What does the waterfall say?<br />
Prompto: I think it says, &#8220;Come in.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the Chocobros advance past the waterfall)<br />
Prompto: Wouldn&#8217;t you know it—an entrance!<br />
Gladio: Looks like the legend checks out.</p>
<p>[Note: If the player visits this area before meeting Talcott and Jared, this dialogue will instead take the form immediately below]<br />
Prompto: And what&#8217;s behind cave number one? It&#8217;s a terror-filled vacation in darkness!<br />
Noctis: Sweet, we won.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon entering the cave behind the waterfall)<br />
Prompto: This place gives me goose bumps. Double back for our coats?<br />
Gladiolus: What&#8217;s the point?<br />
Prompto: Well, looking on the bright side&#8230; Maybe the cold keeps the daemons at bay?<br />
Gladiolus: Yeah, because monsters like warmth.<br />
Prompto: Ah. Sarcasm. Hmm&#8230; But what if they&#8217;re frozen?<br />
Gladiolus: Encased in ice&#8230; Waiting for something warm to pass by&#8230;<br />
Prompto: And then they jump out!<br />
[Note: The audio here has Prompto also make a shivering sound]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as Noct and the others encounter daemons in the cave)<br />
Prompto: And there&#8217;s our warm welcome.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[The four come to an icy slope leading further down into the cave]<br />
Prompto: Heading down a slippery slope&#8230; In slip-sliding shoes. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>[They proceed onto the slope and begin to slide]<br />
Noctis: Wh-whoa!<br />
Ignis: Down we go.</p>
<p>[They come to a stop right in the middle of a group of imp daemons]<br />
Noctis: Aaaaaagh! You things love deep pits. Let&#8217;s get it over with.</p>
<p>[Noct and his retinue dispose of the Imps]<br />
Prompto: So much for a &#8220;little chill.&#8221; I got an ice cream headache—without the ice cream!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as Noct and the others make their way through the cave)<br />
Prompto: I really hope we didn&#8217;t come here for nothing.<br />
Gladiolus: Sure there&#8217;s something if we look.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Noct and the others proceed down another short icy slope]<br />
Noctis: Again? Really!?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after Noct crouches to make his under a low-hanging ice wall)<br />
Prompto: Your tips just got frosted, dude!<br />
Noctis: Really? How&#8217;s it look?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the four enter battle with another group of daemons)<br />
Prompto: How should we do this, Noct?<br />
Noctis: Just do whatever.<br />
Gladiolus: Not helpful.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[As Noctis and his retinue continue, at one point, they must press against a wall to make their way across a narrow ledge]<br />
Gladiolus: Watch your step.<br />
Ignis: No more slip-ups.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[On the other side of the icy ledge, the cavern opens up scenically]<br />
Noctis: Well, this is new.<br />
Gladiolus: You can say that again.</p>
<p>[The foursome make their way up an icy incline]<br />
Prompto: Well, this seems perfectly safe.<br />
Ignis: Focus on walking.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[As they reach the top of the incline, an arachne daemon descends from the ceiling and attacks]<br />
Gladiolus: I did not see that coming.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after defeating the Arachne and proceeding)<br />
Prompto: Hmm, nothing turned up.<br />
Gladio: Did you double-check?<br />
Prompto: Triple-checked.<br />
Gladio: Then, we&#8217;re done.<br />
Prompto: Where to next?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(encountering a group of daemons)<br />
Ignis: Any plan of attack?<br />
Noct: Plow right through &#8217;em.<br />
Ignis: I&#8217;ll circle around then.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after wandering around for an extended period of time)<br />
Ignis: Noct, if I may&#8230;<br />
Noct: Don&#8217;t ask.<br />
Gladio: Yep, we&#8217;re lost.<br />
Noct: Don&#8217;t answer!<br />
Prompto: Don&#8217;t know where we came from, don&#8217;t know where we&#8217;re goin&#8217;.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as Noct and his retinue draw near to the Tomb of the Wanderer)<br />
Gladiolus: So, the glaive is through here?<br />
Noctis: Most likely.<br />
Ignis: Let&#8217;s see for ourselves.</p>
<p>[Note: This dialogue will not play if the player makes the journey to the tomb prior to meeting Jared and Talcott]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon coming to a spot where the path diverges)<br />
Prompto: Eeny-meeny&#8230; Miny-moe&#8230;<br />
Noct: We&#8217;re catching cold.<br />
Prompto: So, here we go!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while exploring a section of this area that ends at a wall)<br />
Prompto: Came to a dead end.<br />
Gladio: And? You find anything?<br />
Prompto: Nothing but ice!<br />
Noctis: Cool.<br />
[Note: Noct says this line with a sarcastic inflection]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Noct and the others reach another narrow ledge where they need to press against the wall to cross; they begin making their way]<br />
Prompto: I&#8217;m freezing&#8230; What I wouldn&#8217;t give for a hot bowl of soup. Mmm&#8230;soup. We&#8217;re almost there&#8230; We gotta be. Right!?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as Noctis and his retinue finally reach the tomb)<br />
Gladiolus: Hey! Knock, knock.<br />
Ignis: We&#8217;re there&#8230;finally.</p>
<p>[Several daemons manifest]<br />
Gladiolus: Can&#8217;t it ever be easy?<br />
Noctis: Never.<br />
Ignis: Where&#8217;s the fun in that?</p>
<p>[Noct and his friends kill the daemons]<br />
Prompto: Does this mean we can go back outside!?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Noctis enters the Tomb of the Wanderer and acquires the weapon that belonged to his ancestor]</p>
<p>Noctis can conjure the Armiger, his arsenal of royal arms, when the circular Armiger bar is full. The bar fills as Noctis attacks and defends, and all his abilities are strengthened while the royal arms are active.</p>

Prompto: Noct, you okay!?<br />
Noctis: What did I&#8230; Where was that?<br />
Gladiolus: What is it?<br />
Noctis: A hole in the ground&#8230;something burning&#8230; The Meteor?<br />
Ignis: You saw the Disc of Cauthess?<br />
Gladiolus: Let&#8217;s make our way back to Lestallum.<br />
Prompto: Yeah, gotta report to Talcott.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as Noctis and his retinue return to the Leville in Lestallum after acquiring the Swords of the Wanderer)<br />
Talcott: Prince Noctis! Welcome back!<br />
Ignis: Your story came to a happy end.<br />
Jared: Well, well!<br />

Noctis: Yeah.<br />
Vyv: Got out while you could, huh? Bad stuff&#8217;s goin&#8217; on down there. You need cash? &#8216;Cause I need people. What d&#8217;ya say? The job&#8217;s yours, if you&#8217;re willin&#8217; and able.<br />

Vyv: The easy kind. Just need a couple of photos, is all. The Disc of Cauthess. One from the south, one from the north.<br />
Noctis: I suppose we could manage that.<br />
Vyv: Yeah? That&#8217;s great, kid. Music to my ears, let me tell you. Now, you&#8217;re gonna need a camera, so what I suggest&#8230;<br />
Noctis: We&#8217;ve already got one.<br />
[Vyv laughs]<br />
Vyv: Came prepared, huh? Guess you&#8217;re ready to roll. Come back as soon as you get the shots. I&#8217;ll be right here waitin&#8217; to see what you do.<br />

Vyv: Hey, you kids got a minute? I got a profitable proposition for ya. Another job to be precise.<br />
Noctis: More photos, right?<br />
Vyv: Correcto-mundo—on the first guess, too. I need shots of Angelgard. Ever seen it? The funny looking island off the coast of Galdin.<br />
Noctis: Yeah, I know it.<br />
Vyv: Figures you would. Famous place. Home of legends, and all that. Anyway, I need a good picture of it. Take a few shots, make it look impressive. I&#8217;ll let you decide where to shoot from.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Vyv after beginning the &#8220;An Eye for Islands&#8221; quest)<br />

Noct: Are you seriously going to publish our photos?<br />
Vyv: How could I not publish beauties like these?<br />
Noct: Really?<br />

Noctis: Sure, I guess.<br />
Vyv: Okay! What I need is more material for my big feature on the old legends.<br />
Noctis: Yeah, sure. So, where do you need us to go?<br />
Vyv: Taelpar Crag, the rift valley that separates Duscae and Cleigne was formed in the age of legends—or so they say. I need shots from two different angles. One shot from each should do it. Your photos are gonna be the highlight of the piece. So get some good ones. I know you can.</p>
<p>[Note by Glenn Morrow: The &#8220;Aftermath of the Astral War&#8221; quest is called 神代の魔大戦 in Japanese. 神代 is &#8220;age of the gods,&#8221; and 魔大戦 is what the English localization calls the &#8220;Great War of Old&#8221; (it&#8217;s literal meaning is &#8220;Magical Great War&#8221;). For the Japanese title of the quest, think of it as something like &#8220;Great War of Old in the Age of the Gods&#8221; or &#8220;Great Magical War in the Age of the Gods.&#8221;</p>
<p>Incidentally, 魔大戦 was also the name for the ancient war in Final Fantasy VI&#8217;s setting that was remembered as the &#8220;War of the Magi&#8221; in the English localization.]<br />

Vyv of Meteor Publishing is putting together a new feature about ancient legends, and has asked the prince to provide the photos. Noctis obliges, and sets out to snap a shot of the gorge at Taelpar Crag.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(completing the &#8220;Aftermath of the Astral War&#8221; quest)<br />
Vyv: So, how&#8217;d it go? Did ya get some good shots?<br />

<p>[Noct shows him the photos Prompto took]<br />
Vyv: Yeah, yeah. Nice. Real nice. I should be good now. It&#8217;s all goin&#8217; to work out. Y&#8217;see, I sort of shoved this feature down their throats, and now I&#8217;m on the hook for it. Couple of sloppy shots and I&#8217;d never hear the end of it!<br />
Noctis: So, what are you? The editor or something?<br />
Vyv: Editor? I&#8217;m the president.<br />
Noctis: Huh?<br />
Vyv: President and CEO, Meteor Publishing, Incorporated. What—surprised?<br />
Noctis: Totally.<br />
Vyv: Guess I don&#8217;t act too presidential. Anyway, now you know who I am. Let&#8217;s keep workin&#8217; together, okay?</p>

Noctis: Yeah, sure.<br />
Vyv: I&#8217;m still workin&#8217; on that feature about the old legends. This time, I need a photo of the royal tomb that lies in the Fallgrove.<br />
Noctis: Um, why do you need that?<br />
Vyv: Come on, you know why. There&#8217;s a close link between the legends and the Lucian royal family. There&#8217;s danger in them woods. You up for it?<br />
Noctis: Sure.<br />
Vyv: I was hopin&#8217; you&#8217;d say that. Try to get a picture of the nearby gate, as well. It&#8217;s a good example of classic Lucian design and architecture.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Vyv after beginning the &#8220;Of Gods and Kings&#8221; quest)<br />
Vyv: The Fallgrove lies on the south and east of Duscae. It&#8217;s uh, on the far side of the Disc of Cauthess.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Vyv again)<br />
Vyv: Once upon a time, those royal tombs held a special power. But folks these days either don&#8217;t know or don&#8217;t care.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Vyv once more)<br />
Vyv: There are ancient Solheim ruins in the same area. But they&#8217;re even more dangerous than the woods.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after beginning the &#8220;Of Gods and Kings&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />

<p>[Noct shows him the pictures Prompto took]<br />

Noctis: Nothing we aren&#8217;t used to.<br />
Vyv: Used to it? What kind of journey are you kids on? Anyway, here&#8217;s your reward. Next job I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; is gonna be tricky. But I&#8217;ll make it worth your while. You&#8217;ll take a pay raise, I presume.</p>

Noctis: Sounds like a new job.<br />
Vyv: You got that right. I want a shot from atop the Rock of Ravatogh.<br />
Noctis: Are you saying we&#8217;re supposed to climb it?<br />
Vyv: That&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m sayin&#8217;. They say there&#8217;s a cave near the summit that offers the finest view in all of creation. This job requires camera skills and fighting skills—and no one&#8217;s more qualified than you kids! Pull this off, and it&#8217;ll be the most talked about photo in the history of my magazine. Good luck.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Vyv after beginning &#8220;Vyv&#8217;s Volcanic Inspiration&#8221;)<br />

&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Vyv again)<br />
Vyv: The Rock of Ravatogh lies in the west of Cleigne. It&#8217;s got a real distinct shape. You can see it from miles away.<br />

<p>(after beginning the &#8220;Vyv&#8217;s Volcanic Inspiration&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />

Ignis: With the pay raise, it&#8217;s worth our while, I&#8217;d say.<br />

Prompto: Hey. I&#8217;ve got it covered.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;Vyv&#8217;s Volcanic Inspiration&#8221;)<br />
The distinctive form of the Rock of Ravatogh has long lured many a landscape photographer, yet few have succeeded in snapping its slopes. Eager to please his readers, Vyv asks Noctis and his friends to climb the volcanic crag and take a photo of the cave at its summit.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Noct and his friends travel to the Rock of Ravatogh and begin their ascent]<br />
Gladiolus: Well, it&#8217;s an uphill climb.<br />
Prompto: Looks pretty insurmountable to me.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as they continue)<br />
Gladio: Just think about what&#8217;s waiting at the top.<br />
Prompto: Lemme guess: one aching back and two sore feet.<br />
Gladio: Like you couldn&#8217;t use some meat on those legs of yours.<br />
Prompto: They work for me.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(continuing the ascent)<br />
Ignis: Little out of our comfort zone.<br />
Prompto: Why do I ever leave my car seat?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[The four come to a split in the path]<br />
Prompto: This way or that way?<br />
Gladio: All your call, Noct.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon taking the left path and coming to a dead end)<br />
Prompto: Yeah! We reached the end.<br />
Gladio: Nice try. Let&#8217;s double back and go the other way.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(resuming the ascent)<br />
Prompto: Did we hit the top? Feeling past my peak.<br />
Gladio: I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ve still got a ways to go.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the path becomes very steep)<br />
Prompto: Killer climb, dude.<br />
Noct: It&#8217;s killing me.<br />
Ignis: Feeling a steep pain.<br />
Gladio: One false step and you won&#8217;t feel anything ever again.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(still facing the steep climb)<br />
Prompto: I think my legs are gonna give. Don&#8217;t even wanna think about how sore I&#8217;m gonna be tomorrow.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Not long after this, the path levels out a bit, but other environmental factors now make continued progress a struggle]<br />
Noct: The hell&#8217;s with the heat?<br />
Ignis: As we climb, so does the temperature.<br />
Prompto: I&#8217;m no geologist, but I&#8217;m pretty sure this is a volcano. Hey! What are the chances of it erupting while we&#8217;re here?<br />
Gladio: Bright side—you won&#8217;t suffer long if it does.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Before long, the path diverges to the left and right once again]<br />
Ignis: We&#8217;ve two paths before us.<br />
Prompto: Noct, do us all a solid and choose the one that&#8217;s not a dead end.<br />
Noctis: Easier said than done.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Choosing the path to the right, there are many spots where steam is rising and magma is peaking out from under the rock along the path; everyone&#8217;s HP gradually decreases while in this area]<br />
Ignis: We&#8217;d best make haste through the hot spots.<br />
Prompto: Any more of this and I&#8217;ll melt!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[At the end of this path, they find a cave from which magma flows and drops into a lava pool]<br />
Gladiolus: How &#8217;bout shooting this?</p>
<p>[Prompto pulls out his camera]<br />
Prompto: Let me get this shot.</p>
<p>[He takes the photo]<br />
Prompto: Well, let&#8217;s go and report in.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon moving close to the lava pool)<br />
Prompto: That looks like lava, so we definitely don&#8217;t want to go down there. And this road won&#8217;t take us any further.<br />
Gladiolus: Seen all there is to see here.<br />
Ignis: Then we search elsewhere.<br />
Gladiolus: Now this is scenery.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Retracing their steps, about halfway back toward the larger fork, the royal retinue comes across a narrow path that branches off from the steamy, magma path]<br />
Prompto: Hey, this path looks promising!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as they make their way down this path)<br />
Noct: I&#8217;m burning up in here.<br />
Gladiolus: And I&#8217;m sweating buckets.<br />
[Ignis sighs]<br />
Ignis: Out of the frying pan&#8230;<br />
Prompto: And into the volcano.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Taking this narrow path brings Noctis and his friends back to the larger fork where they made a choice a few minutes before; taking the other path now, they come to a rock wall]<br />
Ignis: Time to face the cliff head on.<br />
Prompto: By &#8220;face,&#8221; you don&#8217;t mean &#8220;climb&#8221;&#8230;<br />
Gladio: You got a better way up the rock?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Noct and the others climb up one sheer rock wall, come to a ledge, then climb up a much taller wall to a wide, relatively flat area; continuing onward, they come to Owlyss Haven]<br />
Prompto: This place is practically begging to be camped on!<br />
Ignis: Halt our hike a moment?<br />
Prompto: Wait, are we seriously sleeping here?<br />
Gladio: You see a better place?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[As they set off again after camping and begin to make their way down the next path, Gladiolus calls the others&#8217; attention to something in the ravine below]<br />
Gladio: Hold up—down there. What is that?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while continuing on down the path)<br />
Gladiolus: Watch your step, kids.<br />
Prompto: No room for slip-ups, Noct!<br />
Noctis: I&#8217;m not the clumsy one.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[At the end of the path, they find a small slope leading down to a natural rock enclosure]<br />
Prompto: Nowhere left to climb. Should we check out the area below?<br />
Gladiolus: I&#8217;m down if you are.</p>
<p>[Within the enclosure is an enormous bird nest with three eggs approximately the size of a human torso; from here, there is a longer slope leading down into the long, flat ravine; on the other side is another narrow, rather steep path leading upward once again; at the end of this path, tucked away on the side of the mountain, is another royal tomb: the Tomb of the Fierce]</p>
<p>Ignis: Noct, you might want to see this.<br />
Prompto: Score! It&#8217;s all about that treasure.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[After Noct acquires the Mace of the Fierce, the royal retinue sets off back the way they came and makes for a tunnel across the flat ravine; there, they slide down a long slope and are deposited at a much lower spot on the mountain along a narrow path]<br />
Prompto: That was terrifying!<br />
Gladio: But the worst is behind us.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Part of the path opens up, offering a wide view of the surrounding landscape]<br />
Prompto: Wow. Y&#8217;know, this view might be worth the climb.<br />
Noctis: Wouldn&#8217;t go that far.</p>
<p>[At the end of this path, they slide down one more, extra long slope and find themselves back at the dead end from the first forked path they encountered on their journey up the volcano]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(completing the &#8220;Vyv&#8217;s Volcanic Inspiration&#8221; quest)<br />
Vyv: You&#8217;re back—and alive. Did you get it?<br />
Noctis: The photo? Yeah, we got what you wanted.</p>
<p>[Noct shows him the photo that Prompto took]<br />
Vyv: Ah, now this is somethin&#8217; special. Lighting, framing, everything perfect—despite the hazards. You&#8217;ve got the right stuff. You&#8217;re more than worthy of your title&#8230;Prince Noctis.<br />
Noctis: What? I&#8217;m no prince.<br />
Vyv: Hey, I was plannin&#8217; on makin&#8217; extra cash by sellin&#8217; info to the empire on a certain royal heir&#8230;<br />
Noctis: Hey.<br />
Vyv: But when I saw your photos&#8230; Well, I changed my mind. Here, take this—a token of my appreciation. I hope it&#8217;ll prove of some value to you on your journey.</p>

Vyv: Hey, Prince Noctis.<br />
Noctis: What? You want more photos? You know I do. But this time&#8230; I want a photo of your hometown.<br />
Noctis: You mean the Crown City?<br />
Vyv: That&#8217;s right. My readers are demandin&#8217; it. But if anyone&#8217;s gonna take it, it has to be you. You can do it or not. It&#8217;s up to you, but I just need the one shot from outside the city.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Vyv after beginning the &#8220;A Place to Call Home&#8221; quest)<br />
Vyv: Imperial forces are garrisoned in the area. Don&#8217;t get careless, and don&#8217;t get caught!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Vyv again)<br />
Vyv: All I need is a picture of the outside of the city.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Vyv once more)<br />
Vyv: Every shot you kids take is better than the last, I tell you. I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; forward to seeing what you do next.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after beginning the &#8220;A Place to Call Home&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />
Prompto: This next picture&#8217;s gonna be the best yet.<br />
Gladiolus: You&#8217;re pretty sure of yourself.<br />
Prompto: You bet I am.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;A Place to Call Home&#8221;)<br />
Many Crown City citizens have been forced to flee their homes, and more than a few of them yearn to see the land now barred to them. Vyv asks Noctis to head for the hill overlooking Insomnia and take a picture of the Lucian capital.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(completing the &#8220;A Place to Call Home&#8221; quest)<br />
Vyv: Well? Did you get a good one?<br />
Noctis: I don&#8217;t know. Why don&#8217;t you tell me?</p>
<p>[Noct shows him the photo that Prompto took]<br />
Vyv: Black and white. Matches the mood of the scene. Powerful. Very powerful. Thank you for this. Damn if it ain&#8217;t a real work of art. Here—your reward.<br />
Noctis: Thanks as always.<br />
Vyv: It&#8217;s my pleasure, Prince. You know I want to help you. The media king, best pals with the Lucian prince&#8230; Seriously, though. Let&#8217;s keep workin&#8217; together.</p>

Vyv: Hey, Prince Noctis. Can I ask another favor, one royal to another?<br />
Noctis: Sure. What do you have for us?<br />
Vyv: This is a juicy one. I need photographs of imperial bases.<br />
Noctis: What&#8217;s the catch?<br />
Vyv: Me and my readers both, we&#8217;re getting taxed half to death. I figure we&#8217;ve got a right to see what our hard-earned gil is being spent on. I&#8217;ve got a good idea what I&#8217;ll write for the article. You don&#8217;t have to worry about that. But I need the photo. I know it&#8217;s a dangerous job, but you can pull it off.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Vyv after beginning the &#8220;The Pen is Mightier than the Sword&#8221; quest)<br />
Vyv: Get a picture of the whole base.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Vyv again)<br />
Vyv: You come back in one piece, okay?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after beginning the &#8220;The Pen is Mightier than the Sword&#8221; quest and walking away)<br />

&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;The Pen is Mightier than the Sword&#8221;)<br />
The empire has imposed crushing taxes on the territory it now rules, and Vyv intends to reveal just how that tax money is being spent to foster anti-imperial sentiment in the populace. Being of the same mind, Noctis offers to scout Formouth Garrison in Leide and bring back photographs.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(completing the &#8220;The Pen is Mightier than the Sword&#8221; quest)<br />
Vyv: Hey! Good to see you back in one piece.<br />
Noctis: Yeah. We got the photos you wanted.</p>
<p>[Noct shows him the pictures that Prompto took]<br />
Vyv: They came after you?<br />
Noctis: They regretted it.<br />
Vyv: Dammit, you kids are somethin&#8217; else. It&#8217;s high time I started playin&#8217; my part. My company is going to war against the empire. And we&#8217;re gonna keep fightin&#8217; until Lucis gets its rightful king back.<br />
Noctis: What can I say? Appreciate it.<br />
Vyv: Here, take this. It&#8217;s my last donation to the cause. I hope you can use it on your journey.</p>

Vyv: Hey, Prince Noctis. I&#8217;m gonna cut to the chase. I have a new job. You ever thought about photographin&#8217; a spirit?<br />
Noctis: You writing ghost stories now?<br />
Vyv: No, no. Listen. I&#8217;m bein&#8217; serious here. You know the famous Accordo treasure, <em>Lakshmi</em>? The painting&#8217;s haunted by a powerful evil spirit.<br />
Noctis: An evil spirit?<br />
Vyv: I know. Hard to believe. But if it is true, I want the scoop. You follow me? So, if you&#8217;re going to Altissia, take a little detour. Find the paintin&#8217;, and get a photo of that evil spirit.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Vyv after beginning the &#8220;The Cursed Canvas&#8221; quest)<br />
Vyv: <em>Lakshmi</em> is kept secure underground. Beneath the first secretary&#8217;s estate.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(speaking with Vyv again)<br />
Vyv: Imagine if the Accordo national treasure really is haunted. Do you realize what a scoop this&#8217;ll be!?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(quest description for &#8220;The Cursed Canvas&#8221;)<br />
Startling news has reached the ears of Vyv the Media King. According to his source, a spirit haunts the national treasure of Accordo: the painting <em>Lakshmi</em>. His curiosity piqued, Noctis ventures to Altissia to see if the rumors are true.<br />

<p>[At the outlook in Lestallum, Noct and his friends run into a familiar face]<br />
Suspicious Stranger: What a coincidence.<br />
Gladiolus: I&#8217;m not so sure it is.<br />
Suspicious Stranger: Aren&#8217;t nursery rhymes curious things? Like this one: &#8220;From the deep, the Archaean calls&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;&#8230; Yet on deaf ears, the gods&#8217; tongue falls, The King made to kneel, in pain, he crawls.&#8221;<br />
Prompto: So how do we keep him on his feet?<br />
Suspicious Stranger: You need only heed the call. Visit the Archaean and hear his plea. I can take you.<br />
Prompto: We in?<br />
Noctis: I don&#8217;t know.<br />
Prompto: We take a ride&#8230;<br />
Gladiolus: &#8230;but watch our backs.<br />
Ignis: Fair enough.<br />
Noctis: Let&#8217;s do it.</p>
<p>[Ardyn smiles and begins walking toward the car park]<br />
Ardyn: I&#8217;m not one to stand on ceremony, but such an occasion calls for an introduction. Please, call me &#8220;Ardyn.&#8221; Come with me to the car park. That&#8217;s where I left my automobile. She&#8217;s a dear old thing. Pales next to your Regalia, but she&#8217;s never let me down. So we take two vehicles—a convoy of sorts. Shall we?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon arriving at Ardyn&#8217;s car)<br />
Ardyn: All set?</p>
<p>[A prompt appears asking &#8220;Drive with Ardyn to the Disc?&#8221;; the player can select either &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No&#8221;]</p>
<p>(when selecting &#8220;Yes&#8221;)<br />
Ardyn: Allow me to do the honor of assigning your driver&#8230; I choose you!</p>
<p>[A prompt appears to select either &#8220;Take the wheel,&#8221; &#8220;Ride with Ardyn,&#8221; &#8220;Leave it to Ignis,&#8221; or &#8220;Drive Ardyn&#8217;s car&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Take the wheel<br />
Noct: Fine by me.</p>
<p>Earned 500 EXP.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Ride with Ardyn<br />
Noct: What if I ride with you?<br />
Ardyn: You might find the cab fare to be more than you bargained for.</p>
<p>[Ardyn chuckles]</p>
<p>Earned 2 AP.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Leave it to Ignis<br />
Noct: All yours, Ignis.<br />
Ardyn: Come now, he always drives. Be a friend and let him rest for a change.</p>
<p>Ignis earned 1,000 EXP.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />

Ardyn: You might find the rental fees to be more than you bargained for.</p>
<p>[Ardyn chuckles]</p>
<p>Earned 1 AP and 100 EXP.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>Ardyn: You drive your car, and I drive mine. With that decided, let us be off.</p>

As the land is rocked by tremors, Noctis is wracked with headaches. The self-styled &#8216;Man of No Consequence&#8217; advises the would-be King to go and heed the Archaean&#8217;s call. Though loath to believe a suspicious stranger, the four friends nevertheless find themselves with no recourse but to follow Ardyn to the Disc of Cauthess, where Titan is said to slumber.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<h3>The Blessing of the Gods</h3>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>[The scene opens on Ardyn&#8217;s car and the Regalia sitting side by side on the road outside Lestallum; Ardyn is in his car, the Chocobros are in the Regalia]<br />
Ardyn: Just to be clear, this isn&#8217;t a race, it is a chase. You&#8217;re not to pass me. Lose sight of me, and you&#8217;ll lose your way. And no tailgating. An accident would spoil the trip.<br />
Noctis: Alright, alright. Let&#8217;s hit the road already.<br />
Ardyn: As you wish. Drive safely, now.</p>
<p>[Ardyn drives on ahead]<br />
Prompto: First Galdin, and then Lestallum&#8230; What a coincidence, huh?<br />
Gladiolus: Way too convenient to be a coincidence. I reckon he&#8217;s following us around.<br />
Ignis: But to what end? That question bothers me deeply, as does his origin.<br />
Prompto: It&#8217;s hard for me to picture that guy in the empire.<br />
Gladiolus: But it&#8217;s even harder to imagine him as a Lucian.<br />
Ignis: I&#8217;d sooner not rely on him.<br />
Prompto: But he may be our only way into the Disc of Cauthess.<br />
Gladiolus: What&#8217;s His Highness&#8217;s opinion of this &#8220;Ardyn&#8221;?<br />
Noctis: Don&#8217;t really have one—he&#8217;s nothing more than a creepy old dude to me.<br />
Prompto: You hit the nail on the head right there.<br />
Gladiolus: Well, that&#8217;s why we came up with a plan.<br />
Noctis: Gotta &#8220;watch our backs&#8221; the whole way.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(continuing to follow Ardyn)<br />
Ignis: Noct, how are the headaches?<br />
Noctis: Fine for now, but they come without warning.<br />
Gladiolus: Wouldn&#8217;t want to have one behind the wheel.<br />
Prompto: Stop if you need to, alright?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(continuing to follow Ardyn)<br />
Gladiolus: So, any havens along the way?<br />
Prompto: Oh, somebody wants to camp. Somebody else wants a proper bed.<br />
Gladiolus: Nice firm ground&#8217;s much better for your back.<br />
Prompto: Can&#8217;t we at least make it a caravan? I don&#8217;t get why you like camping so much&#8230;<br />
Gladiolus: Under the stars, at one with nature—what&#8217;s not to like? Out in the wild, there&#8217;s no rules to follow, no checkout time.<br />
Ignis: I daresay you had Noct with &#8220;no checkout time.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(Ardyn stops at the Cauthess Coernix Station; the Chocobros do likewise)<br />
Ardyn: What say we call it a day here?<br />
Ignis: &#8220;What say&#8221; we continue on to Cauthess?<br />
Ardyn: The Archaean&#8217;s not going anywhere.<br />
Ignis: Neither are we, under your stewardship.<br />
Prompto: So we make camp&#8230;<em>with Ardyn</em>.<br />
Noctis: Hell no.<br />
Gladiolus: Might as well get the tent up.<br />
Ardyn: Oh, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve never really been one for the outdoors. I shall foot the bill, so let us stay at the caravan over yonder.</p>

Ardyn: Well, well, if it isn&#8217;t yours truly.<br />
Prompto: Um, if you&#8217;d rather not be in photos&#8230;<br />

Lunafreya<br />
Though I am still young, my blood is true. As my mother before me, I’ll work to bring peace to one and all.</p>
<p>Narration<br />
That marked the ascension of the youngest Oracle in history.</p>
<p>Interviewer<br />
Is it hard giving blessings?</p>
<p>Lunafreya<br />
It would be selfish of me to complain of my burden, when so many suffer in wait. I hope they trust I will not rest until they all know solace.</p>
<p>Narration<br />
The world watched on with worry and wonder as the young girl grew.</p>
<p>Interviewer<br />
I understand you have a message for us?</p>
<p>Lunafreya<br />
If you know of any who are bedridden, or unable to come to me… Pray, send word, and I…shall go to them. I follow my calling. I will not halt my steps for anything else.</p>
<p>Narration<br />
In time, her strength would become an inspiration to all.</p>
<p>Interviewer<br />
What is your opinion of the treaty?</p>
<p>Lunafreya<br />
When war has ended, so too will suffering subside. The treaty is a momentous step towards a brighter future. Let there be no doubt: we walk the path of true peace.<br />

Man (1): I hope she&#8217;s okay, wherever she&#8217;s headed.</p>
<p>[The scene fades to white and transitions to Tenebrae, where Lunafreya is surrounded by citizens; she approaches an older man sitting on a bench under a tent; a much younger man standing next to him takes his walking stick so that Lunafreya can take the older man&#8217;s hands into her own]<br />
Lunafreya: Please, set your heart at rest. I shall do what I can to ease your suffering.</p>
<p>[The right side of the old man&#8217;s face can now be seen; it is heavily covered in dark blotches]<br />
Old Man: Lady&#8230;Lunafreya&#8230;</p>
<p>[As Lunafreya holds the man&#8217;s hands, yellow light begins emanating from between their hands; she gently sets his hands down on his lap, then places her hands on either side of his head and touches her forehead to his; the same yellow light as before emanates from where their foreheads meet]<br />
Lunafreya: Blessed Stars of life and light, deliver us from darkness&#8217; blight.</p>
<p>[The blotches disappear from the man&#8217;s face, much to his wonder and amazement]<br />
Lunafreya: That is all I can do for now, but trust that relief will come in a matter of days.</p>
<p>[The younger man next to the older man looks stunned as well]<br />
Man: I—it&#8217;s a miracle.</p>
<p>[He bows to Lunafreya, then passes the older man&#8217;s walking stick back to him and helps him stand]<br />
Old Man: Oh, bless you! Thank you, Lady Lunafreya.</p>
<p>[Lunafreya nods as the two men walk out from under the tent; another voice now calls out to Lunafreya]<br />
Old Woman: Oh, Lady Lunafreya! I left at dawn to come see you.</p>
<p>[An older woman, her back severely bent, hobbles toward the younger woman; Lunafreya reaches out and takes the woman&#8217;s hand, then begins guiding her toward the seat the older man had just been sitting on]<br />
Lunafreya: You must be exhausted.<br />
Old Woman: Indeed, a fair bit. But more grateful than anything.</p>
<p>[Lunafreya helps the old woman to sit]<br />
Lunafreya: Let us begin at once.</p>
<p>[The scene fades to white once more and transitions back to the small gathering around the radio at the Coernix station]<br />
Vendor: We shoulda done more—like takin&#8217; her in.<br />
Man (2): Damn right. She coulda bunked at my place.<br />
Man (1): Or mine. I&#8217;m sure the missus would understand.</p>
<p>Gladiolus: Don&#8217;t think being married will give you excuse not to work out.<br />
[Note: The audio here has Gladio say &#8220;Don&#8217;t think being married will give you an excuse not to work out&#8221;]<br />
Noctis: That came out of nowhere.<br />
Gladio: You can&#8217;t just let yourself go with the eyes of the world on ya.<br />
Prompto: I don&#8217;t know about that. He seems to have pulled it off so far.<br />
Noct: What does that mean?<br />
Ignis: All the more reason he needs to clean up his act now.<br />
Gladio: Feel sorry for Lady Lunafreya if he doesn&#8217;t.<br />
Prompto: He&#8217;s got you there, Noct. Everyone would be like, &#8220;Oh, she could do so much better than him.&#8221;<br />

Gladiolus: Whoever thought of tapping into the Meteor&#8217;s power was a genius.<br />
Prompto: Can you even go near that thing?<br />
Ignis: They harvest fragments found nearby—pieces that broke off when the Meteor fell. Almost fell, I should say, for the Archaean caught it.<br />
Gladiolus: And he&#8217;s still there, holding the thing up.<br />
Noctis: Guess he never misses leg day.<br />
Prompto: Or any day for that matter.<br />
Ignis: His unceasing toil and the Meteor&#8217;s might form the tenets of worship for the locals of Duscae.<br />
Gladiolus: Makes you wonder what it&#8217;s like down there at his feet.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(still following Ardyn)<br />
Ignis: So you know, it&#8217;s hot where we&#8217;re going. Will the camera fare alright?<br />
Prompto: As long as I avoid open flames, it should be okay. I think.<br />
Gladiolus: We don&#8217;t have a spare if it breaks.<br />
Noctis: Leave it in the car?<br />
Prompto: Oh no, I&#8217;m taking it. Not every day you get up close and personal with the Archaean. I&#8217;d kick myself if I missed the photo op.<br />
Gladiolus: Spoken like a true photographer.<br />
Prompto: As they say, &#8220;Better to try and fail than never to try at all.&#8221;<br />
Noctis: Look at you.<br />
Prompto: Well, <em>they</em> say that, not me.<br />
Noctis: Well, you just do what you gotta.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while still following Ardyn)<br />
Prompto: Hey, Iggy. Can your glasses take the heat?<br />
Ignis: Well, I don&#8217;t see why they shouldn&#8217;t.<br />
Noctis: Even if they couldn&#8217;t, he&#8217;d still be alright.<br />
Gladiolus: Yeah, Iggy&#8217;s eyes ain&#8217;t that bad.<br />
Prompto: Oh, really?<br />
Ignis: My vision is passable without corrective lenses.<br />
Prompto: Then why not take &#8217;em off sometimes?<br />
Ignis: Well&#8230;<br />
Noctis: You don&#8217;t get it, huh?<br />
Gladiolus: Ignis likes his world to be crystal clear.<br />
Ignis: Indeed. I&#8217;ve never been one for ambiguity.<br />
Prompto: Ah. I think I&#8217;m getting the picture now.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(and still following Ardyn)<br />
Prompto: Hey Ignis, how&#8217;s it feel being away from the wheel?<br />
Ignis: Positively frightening.<br />
Noctis: What&#8217;re you sayin&#8217;?<br />
Ignis: That I&#8217;m no stranger to His Highness&#8217;s driving habits.<br />
Noctis: &#8216;Preciate the confidence.<br />
Gladiolus: Read a book. It&#8217;ll take your mind off it.<br />
Ignis: I&#8217;d rather keep my eyes on the road for now, thank you.<br />
Prompto: I guess nothing can take your mind off Noct&#8217;s driving.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(the cars arrive at the Cauthess barricade)<br />
Ardyn: We&#8217;re here.<br />
Noctis: Better not be a setup.<br />
Ardyn: Have I given you reason to doubt me?<br />
Prompto: You don&#8217;t exactly inspire confidence.<br />
Gladiolus: Yeah, not very straightforward.</p>
<p>[Ardyn shouts over the wall]<br />
Ardyn: Hello! It&#8217;s me! Be so kind as to open up!</p>
<p>[The gate opens]<br />
Prompto: Wow, that worked?<br />
Ardyn: I may not look like much, but I do have some influence. Aren&#8217;t you glad we came together? Your audience with divinity lies ahead.<br />
Prompto: You&#8217;re leaving?<br />
Ardyn: I drop you at the Archaean&#8217;s open door, and with that, bid you farewell.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Noctis drives the Regalia onward]<br />
Gladiolus: I&#8217;ve met some weirdos&#8230;<br />
Ignis: I hope we never meet that one again.<br />
Prompto: Whoa! Little harsh there, don&#8217;t you think?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Further down the path to Titan]<br />
Prompto: Guy really knew his stuff about nursery rhymes.<br />
Noctis: Yeah, nothing creepy about that!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the royal retinue gets out of the Regalia and proceeds down the more narrow path on foot)<br />
Noctis: So we keep going this way.<br />
Gladiolus: Then we&#8217;ll find out what the empire&#8217;s up to.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(along the path)<br />
Ignis: These ruins&#8230;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon getting close to the ledge at the end of the path)<br />
Prompto: Is that what I think it is?<br />
Ignis: Didn&#8217;t expect to find a royal tomb here.<br />
Gladiolus: Would be a shame not to grab that power, eh, Highness?<br />
Noctis: Let&#8217;s grab it and go.</p>
<p>[Noctis walks up to the sarcophagus near the ledge, holds out his hand and acquires the royal arm residing here]</p>
<p>Blade of the Mystic x 1<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Immediately after Noctis has acquired his newest royal arm, the ground begins to shake dramatically, causing all four Chocobros to lose their balance; Prompto and Ignis fall down while Gladio and Noct just barely manage to keep themselves upright]<br />
Prompto: Here we go again.<br />
Gladiolus: This one&#8217;s huge!<br />
Ignis: Get away! Quickly!</p>
<p>[Noctis&#8217;s headache suddenly returns, bringing him down to one knee; he recovers as fast as he can and tries to run away from the crumbling ledge; the sarcophagus of his ancestor falls away with the ledge; Noct is unable to get far before the ground falls out from under his feet, dropping him against a slope, which he slides down until he briefly lands on a small ledge below; he quickly slides off this ledge and turns to try grabbing on; he can&#8217;t get a hand hold and slides into what will be a long plummet; suddenly, Gladio shouts out to him from a few feet away on the ledge]<br />
Gladiolus: Noct!</p>
<p>[Gladiolus dives out over the ledge and, with his left hand, grabs Noctis&#8217;s right arm]<br />
Gladiolus: I gotcha!</p>
<p>[The two work together to get Noctis pulled up onto the ledge beside Gladiolus]<br />
Gladio: C&#8217;mon, pull yourself up.</p>
<p>[The two let themselves fall down away from the ledge; suddenly, the Meteor begins to rise before them, revealing Titan, who has been holding the chunk of space debris on his back for many years]<br />
Noctis: What the—?</p>
<p>[Titan says something indecipherable in the language of the gods]<br />
Noct: Goddamn&#8230; This is the Archaean?<br />
Gladio: Seems we woke the big guy up.<br />
Noct: He&#8217;s trying too tell me something &#8230; But what?</p>
<p>[Prompto suddenly calls out from high above]<br />
Prompto: Noct! You okay?<br />
Ignis: Thank heavens you&#8217;re safe. Is there a way back up?<br />
Noct: No, but there&#8217;s a path. Gonna see where it leads.<br />
Gladio: You two try to get down.<br />
Ignis: Very well. We&#8217;ll look for a way. Be careful, now.<br />
Noct: You, too.<br />
Prompto: What? We&#8217;re going where!?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Noct and Gladio begin making their way down the path]<br />
Gladiolus: Don&#8217;t rush off on your own, huh?<br />
Noctis: Don&#8217;t get left behind.<br />
Gladio: Wise guy.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[As they make their way down the divergent path, a group of Dynoaevis birds fly overhead]<br />
Gladio: They&#8217;re on edge—let&#8217;s not ruffle their feathers any more.<br />
Noct: Um, try shutting your beak.<br />
Gladio: Just offering sound advice.<br />
Noctis: Yeah, like a parrot in my ear.</p>
<p>The flames spurting forth cause characters to overheat and gradually lose HP.</p>
<p>Gladiolus: Heat&#8217;s making me woozy.<br />
Noctis: How the hell does it get this hot? Feels like I&#8217;m about to combust.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Noctis and Gladio seemingly reach the end of the path]<br />
Noctis: Damn&#8230;<br />
Gladiolus: Hey, over here.</p>
<p>[Gladio shows Noct a narrow ledge that wraps around the cliffside]<br />
Gladiolus: No room for error here.<br />
Noctis: No time to chill, either. Make it quick.</p>
<p>[Gladio goes first, slowly but steadily inching his way around the ledge; after allowing Gladio a moment to ensure the stability of the ledge, Noct follows]<br />
Noct: Just want this to be over.</p>
<p>[Once both are making their way around the ledge, the ground begins to shake again]<br />
Gladiolus: Tremors&#8230; Hang on!<br />
Noctis: Ugh&#8230; My head&#8230;<br />
Gladio: Again? Of all the times&#8230; Let&#8217;s hurry the hell across.</p>
<p>[The two continue inching their way along; it&#8217;s slow going, especially with Noct having to grab his forehead every few seconds due to his headache]<br />
Gladiolus: Noct. You doing alright?</p>
<p>[The tremors intensify]<br />
Gladio: What now?</p>
<p>[Titan&#8217;s hand suddenly comes into view as it crashes through a rock formation to reach for Noctis]<br />
Noct: Hey! Titan! What&#8217;s the big idea!?<br />
Gladiolus: Save it! Get to solid ground first!<br />
Noct: Faster!<br />
Gladio: Calm down. I&#8217;m going as fast as I can.</p>
<p>[Titan continues reaching for Noct but coming up just short of him as he and Gladiolus continue making their way around the ledge]<br />
Gladio: Almost there.</p>
<p>[Gladio grabs onto a branch from a tree that&#8217;s extending out over the ledge]<br />
Noctis: Hurry!</p>
<p>[Another powerful tremor causes Noctis to fall forward out over the ledge]<br />
Gladio: Whoa!</p>
<p>[Holding onto the tree branch with his right hand, Gladio reaches out with his left to grab Noctis&#8217;s right arm and swing him around onto solid ground; he then leaps from the narrow ledge to the one he&#8217;s tossed Noctis just in time; Titan&#8217;s hand crashes into the rock wall of the ledge where the young king and his Shield had just been]<br />
Gladiolus: If that&#8217;s his welcome, hate to see how he treats intruders.</p>
<p>[Gladio reaches down and helps pull Noct to his feet]<br />
Noctis: You wanna talk? So do I.<br />
Gladiolus: Glad the feeling&#8217;s mutual. Let&#8217;s move.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Noctis and Gladio proceed down their newest path, eventually sliding under a narrow rock archway and down a short incline]<br />
Noctis: I&#8217;m sick of this endless walking&#8230;</p>
<p>[Gladio suddenly grabs him by his shirt and pulls him close]<br />
Gladiolus: And I&#8217;m sick of your endless whining. Calm the hell down.<br />
Noctis: Get off my back.<br />
Gladiolus: Are you a man of royal blood or aren&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>[A prompt appears to select either &#8220;Yeah&#8221; or &#8220;Sort of&#8221;]</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Yeah<br />
Noctis: Of course I am.</p>
<p>[Noct pushes Gladio&#8217;s arm away]<br />
Noctis: I couldn&#8217;t forget it if I tried. What about it?<br />
Gladio: I ain&#8217;t saying that you&#8217;ve forgotten, but you gotta know something: You&#8217;re not the only one who&#8217;s having a tough time. We&#8217;re all on edge. We Amicitia are the king&#8217;s sworn shields. Guard the king with our lives—that&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s always been. I&#8217;ve embraced my duty. And I take pride in it. When you can&#8217;t focus, I focus for you. It&#8217;s my job, so let me do it, alright?<br />
Noctis: Alright.</p>
<p>Gladio&#8217;s words lit a fire in Noctis&#8217;s heart. Now Riled, Noctis&#8217;s strength has increased by 50%.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;<br />
Sort of<br />
Noctis: Above all else, I&#8217;m just a man.<br />
Gladiolus: Just a man? The kingdom&#8217;s fate is in your hands!</p>
<p>[Gladio shoves him]<br />
Gladiolus: Your life ain&#8217;t just yours alone! You have to live for others, not only yourself! We Amicitia are the king&#8217;s sworn shields. Guard the king with our lives—that&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s always been. I&#8217;ve embraced my duty. And I take pride in it. When you can&#8217;t focus, I focus for you. It&#8217;s my job, so let me do it, alright?<br />
Noctis: Alright.</p>
<p>Gladio&#8217;s words spurred Noctis to self-reflection. Now roused, Noctis&#8217;s vitality has increased by 50%.<br />
&#8212;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[The two continue on]<br />
Gladio: Sorry, but I had to get it out. C&#8217;mon. And remember, don&#8217;t rush ahead on your own.<br />
Noct: Hey, Gladio. Your dad&#8230;I&#8217;m grateful to him.<br />
Gladiolus: Just doin&#8217; his job.</p>
<p>[Noctis&#8217;s phone suddenly rings]<br />
Gladio: &#8230;Hmm? Isn&#8217;t that your phone?</p>
<p>[Noct answers]<br />
Noctis: Ignis.</p>
<p>[Noct looks up to see imperial drop ships flying into the Disc of Cauthess area; Ignis is speaking, but the signal is filled with static, and cuts off after a few short seconds]<br />
Ignis: You&#8217;re safe. Good. Listen, imperial troops are near.</p>
<p>[Noctis resumes speaking to Gladio]<br />
Noctis: Got cut off. But it sounds like we&#8217;re about to have imperial company.<br />
Gladiolus: About to get even hotter in here.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Noct and Gladio find five magitek troopers waiting for them right in front of Titan]<br />
Gladiolus: We finally made it.<br />
Noctis: I know.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[After defeating the magitek troopers, Noctis yells at Titan]<br />
Noctis: Hey! I&#8217;m here!</p>
<p>[Titan begins speaking in the language of the gods again; Noct grabs his head in pain]<br />
Noctis: What the hell is it you want? Quit screwing with my head!</p>
<p>[Noctis realizes Titan has swung his fist, and that it&#8217;s coming toward him]<br />
Noct: You gotta be kidding me.</p>
<p>[Titan&#8217;s fist crashes into Noctis and sends him skyward; Noct point-warps back to the ground, where Titan&#8217;s foot begins descending toward him now]<br />
Noctis: You serious? Looks like I&#8217;ve got no choice.</p>
<p>[Noct swings his sword into the sole of Titan&#8217;s foot to parry the attack; he manages to deflect it, but only for a moment; Titan attempts to stomp on him once more]<br />
Noctis: Oh man.</p>
<p>[Noctis begins to parry Titan once again, but Gladio leaps in and tackles his charge clear of the god&#8217;s foot]<br />
Gladiolus: Noct!</p>
<p>[The two begin to get up]<br />
Gladiolus: Are you alright!?<br />
Noct: I owe you one.<br />
Gladio: This ain&#8217;t gonna work. We gotta run.<br />
Noct: Best advice you&#8217;ve given all day.<br />
Gladio: Well, I can&#8217;t have you dying here. C&#8217;mon.</p>
<p>[Gladio and Noct begin running away while Titan repeatedly attempts to punch them]<br />
Gladiolus: We&#8217;re sitting ducks here. Hurry!<br />
Noctis: Yeah, don&#8217;t need to tell me!</p>
<p>[The two of them come to a rock wall that&#8217;s too high for Noctis to leap up to reach]<br />
Gladio: Over here!</p>
<p>[Gladio gives him a rapid boost to the ledge above]<br />
Gladiolus: Go, go!</p>
<p>[Noct is on his hands and knees]<br />
Noctis: Dammit.</p>
<p>[Gladio manages to reach the ledge and pull himself up beside Noctis; they quickly run and leap out of the way as Titan&#8217;s hand comes down and smashes the ground; Gladio gets back to his feet in a flash]<br />
Gladiolus: Don&#8217;t stop! Run!</p>
<p>[Noctis gets back to his feet and runs]<br />
Noctis: He just won&#8217;t quit.</p>
<p>[Titan&#8217;s open-palmed hand chases Noctis as he runs, ripping up the ground; Gladio steps forward with his sword at the ready]<br />
Gladiolus: I&#8217;ll hold him! Get clear!</p>
<p>[Gladio manages to halt the hand&#8217;s advance with his sword]<br />
Noctis: Gladio!<br />
Gladiolus: Hurry up! I can&#8217;t keep this up!</p>
<p>[Noctis point-warps down to Titan&#8217;s feet, where he begins parrying one swing after another; after attempting a warp-strike into Titan&#8217;s incoming fist, he&#8217;s knocked to the ground; Noct pulls himself to his feet, though]<br />
Noctis: I&#8217;m not gonna take any more of this crap!</p>
<p>[After parrying yet another swing, Titan&#8217;s left arm is momentarily paralyzed; Noct begins attacking the arm while it&#8217;s vulnerable; after the battle continues for another moment, Ignis and Prompto arrive]<br />
Prompto: Did you miss us?<br />
Ignis: Apologies.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Suddenly, Prompto notices the other participants of the battle]<br />
Prompto: Think those imperial soldiers just wanna say &#8220;hi&#8221;?</p>
<p>[Several imperial drop ships swoop in while magitek troopers fire harpoons into Titan; he takes another swing at Noctis and the others, then Gladiolus arrives]<br />
Gladio: Are we alright?<br />
Noct: Gettin&#8217; by.</p>
<p>[After causing a little more damage to Titan&#8217;s arm, he falls forward and his arm comes crashing down to support him]</p>
<p>When the Armiger is active, Noctis can deplete the rest of the Armiger bar to perform the Armiger Chain, a powerful joint attack with his friends. The more energy left in the bar, the more powerful the attack.</p>
<p>Noctis: We&#8217;re all here. Let&#8217;s do it.</p>
<p>[Noct and his friends cause a lot more damage to Titan&#8217;s arm; Ignis then hurls a Blizzard spell at the god&#8217;s appendage]<br />
Ignis: The game&#8217;s up!</p>
<p>[First, Gladio then Prompto hurl yet more Blizzard spells at Titan&#8217;s arm]<br />
Prompto: You&#8217;re out!</p>
<p>[Titan&#8217;s left arm freezes from the elbow down]<br />
Noctis: It&#8217;s over!</p>
<p>[Noctis swings his sword down into the arm, shattering it all the way up to the elbow; Titan then collapses]<br />
Noctis: Hey, we all still here?<br />
Gladio: Yep, still here.<br />
Ignis: If a little battered.<br />
Prompto: Does this mean it&#8217;s over?</p>
<p>[The tremors suddenly resume in intensity]<br />
Noct: What—what is it now?<br />
Ignis: What is he doing?<br />
Prompto: He&#8217;s winding up!<br />
Gladiolus: For the big one!</p>
<p>[Titan roars; gold lights begin to emanate from his body, some of which coalesce around Noct, showing him Titan&#8217;s memory of Luna standing before the god]<br />
Noct: That was&#8230; &#8230;Luna. You spoke with her. That&#8217;s why&#8230;</p>
<p>[Titan and the Meteor suddenly discorporate in a powerful flash that sends all the imperial ships in the vicinity crashing to the ground; lava spews from the earth as the Disc of Cauthess crumbles around Noctis and his retinue]<br />
Gladiolus: Doesn&#8217;t get much worse than this.</p>
<p>[The four find themselves trapped; suddenly, an imperial drop ship descends to their location]<br />
Ignis: The empire! Now?</p>
<p>[The drop ship&#8217;s door lowers; Ardyn is standing there]<br />
Ardyn: Fancy meeting you here!</p>
<p>[Noctis and the others stare at him in stunned silence]<br />
Ardyn: It occurs to me I never formally introduced myself. Izunia. Ardyn Izunia.<br />
Ignis: Imperial Chancellor Izunia?<br />
Ardyn: At your service. And more importantly, to your aid.</p>
<p>[None of the Chocobros move, instead offering only uncertain stares]<br />
Ardyn: I guarantee your safe passage. Though you&#8217;re always welcome to take your chances down there.</p>
<p>[Noct and the others continue staring back, clearly frustrated]<br />
Ardyn: Buried among the rubble, is it?<br />
Ignis: Dying here is not an option. We have no choice, Noct.<br />
Noctis: I know.<br />
&#8212;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>CHAPTER 5 &#8211; Dark Clouds</strong></span><br />
As Cauthess crumbles, the imperial chancellor swoops in to usher the four friends to safety, but their reprieve is only temporary, as Duscae&#8217;s skies tell of trouble on the horizon. With the Regalia missing and the roads closed, the four friends find themselves stranded.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Note by Glenn Morrow: The following scene was added to the beginning of Chapter 5 with the Version 1.23 update of March 5, 2018]</p>
<p>[The screen is black]<br />
Ardyn: Oh, thank the gods I found you boys.</p>
<p>[The scene fades in from black; Ardyn, Noctis and the others are in the hold of Ardyn&#8217;s drop ship; Ignis is standing, facing Ardyn while the others sit hunched on the floor]<br />
Ignis: And what will you do with us now?<br />
Ardyn: Why, grant you safe passage—just as I said.<br />
Prompto: Pretty generous offer for an imperial.<br />
Ardyn: Come now. Is it fair to begrudge a man the circumstances of his birth?<br />
Prompto: Well, no, I guess not&#8230;</p>
<p>[The scene transitions to Ignis now sitting crouched next to the other Chocobros]<br />
Gladiolus: So what do we do after he drops us off?<br />
Noctis: Go get the car.<br />
Ignis: Can&#8217;t leave her unattended for long.</p>
<p>[The scene transitions to Ignis standing and facing Ardyn once more]<br />
Ignis: Chancellor. If you truly wish to aid us in our efforts, then I request you release us this instant.<br />
Ardyn: This instant? It&#8217;s a long way down. Perhaps the army could break your fall. Or perhaps you could simply sit back and enjoy the ride. You needn&#8217;t worry: you&#8217;re in good hands with me.</p>
<p>[The scene fades to black once more and remains so as the sounds of the drop ship&#8217;s door lowering are heard]<br />
Ardyn: Here&#8217;s hoping you find that car of yours.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[The screen is still black]<br />
Several days later&#8230;</p>
<p>[The scene fades in to show imperial soldiers conducting inspections of civilian vehicles at roadway blockades]<br />
Newscaster<br />
High Commander Ravus Nox Fleuret issued the following statement regarding the imperial blockades across the region:</p>
<p>Ravus<br />
We believe the insurgents behind the Citadel attack have taken refuge in Duscae. The blockades shall help us root out the criminals. I realize the inconvenience imposed upon the citizenry, but we must each do our part for the good of all.</p>
<p>Newscaster<br />
The high commander also stressed the imperial army would continue its recovery efforts in the Crown City.</p>
<p>[The scene transitions to show the Regalia being impounded by imperial soldiers]<br />
Newscaster<br />
The frequent quakes which rocked the Duscae and Cleigne regions in recent days have finally quieted. In response, the empire provided the following comment:</p>
<p>Ravus<br />
The cause of the tremors was the Archaean, who had awakened in a fit of rage. The imperial army took swift action and laid the unruly giant to rest, thus averting disaster.</p>
<p>Newscaster<br />
Eyewitness reports confirm Titan has disappeared from the Disc of Cauthess.</p>
<p>[The scene transitions to the Chocobros]<br />
Wiz Chocobo Post</p>
<p>Prompto: I still can&#8217;t believe it. I mean, shouldn&#8217;t the car have turned up by now?<br />
Ignis: We should wait until Cindy&#8217;s done asking around the local garages before we despair.<br />
Gladio: Let&#8217;s not fool ourselves. The empire has it.</p>
<p>The Regalia and all related features are unavailable until the car is found.</p>
<p>Prompto: Then maybe we could ask Ardyn to help us out again, right?<br />
Gladiolus: The imperial chancellor.<br />
Ignis: He represents a problem, not a solution.<br />
Prompto: So where does that leave us?<br />
Ignis: Stranded, awaiting word from Hammerhead.<br />
Gladiolus: In the meantime, we&#8217;ll have to hoof it.<br />
Prompto: Look, it&#8217;s Umbra!</p>
<p>[The others turn to see the canine Messenger a few feet away; as Noctis approaches him, the dog runs off]<br />
Ignis: Someone&#8217;s sending us a message.</p>
<p>[The Chocobros chase after Umbra and catch up to him in the tree line just outside the chocobo ranch; there, Gentiana is waiting for them]<br />
Noctis: &#8230;Gentiana.<br />
Gentiana: Hear me, O King of the Stone. By the Stormsender&#8217;s blessing will the path to the Stone be opened. The Oracle goes hence in her King&#8217;s name.<br />
Noctis: Luna—where is she now?<br />
Gentiana: The eye of the Storm. When the covenant is forged, the Oracle and ring shall await their King at the Walls of Water. Stray not from the path.</p>
<p>[Gentiana is gone; Ignis explains to Prompto, who looks confused]<br />
Ignis: She&#8217;s a Messenger, a spirit faithful to the Oracle.<br />
Prompto: For real?<br />
Gladiolus: We&#8217;re going beyond real now, pal.</p>
<p>[Noct checks the notebook with Umbra to find a message from Luna saying &#8220;My prayers are with you, Noctis&#8221;; a prompt appears asking &#8220;What will you write back?&#8221;; the player can select either &#8220;I received the blessing. Thank you, Luna,&#8221; &#8220;Still rolling along,&#8221; or &#8220;Got it&#8221;; after writing his reply in the book, Noct puts it back in Umbra&#8217;s bag, then speaks to the dog]<br />
Noctis: Let Luna know&#8230; I&#8217;m okay, and she won&#8217;t have to wait much longer—we&#8217;ll be together soon.</p>
<p>[Noct has a flashback to when he and his father visited Tenebrae, when he and Luna were children; specifically, he recalls a time she was recounting details of the Cosmogony to him]<br />
Luna: The Crystals was gifted to mankind that we might know lasting prosperity.<br />
Noctis: If the Crystal belongs to everyone, how come only Lucis gets to use it?<br />
Luna: The kings of Lucis do not simply use the Crystal; they also protect it.<br />
Noctis: Wait, so my dad&#8217;s guarding it?<br />
Luna: Yes.<br />
Noct: I had no idea.<br />
Luna: To crown the King of Light is the calling of the Crystal. And keeping the Crystal safe until that day falls to the line of Lucis.<br />
Noctis: And I&#8217;m the Chosen?<br />
Luna: Yes. Only the True King, anointed by the Crystal, can purge our star of its scourge.<br />
Noctis: You really think I can do that?<br />
Luna: As Oracle, I will see to it. To aid the King is the Oracle&#8217;s calling.<br />
Noctis: Then&#8230;I guess I can do it. I won&#8217;t let you down.<br />
Luna: I know you won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>[Note by Glenn Morrow: When Luna says &#8220;Only the True King, anointed by the Crystal, can purge our star of its scourge,&#8221; what she refers to as &#8220;star&#8221; is 星 (i.e. hoshi) in Japanese; the word used for celestial bodies in general. It can mean &#8220;star,&#8221; but can also refer to planets &#8212; and, indeed, is not only what everyone in FFVII refers to that game&#8217;s planet by, but also what FFXV&#8217;s Lore Guide from the game&#8217;s opening tutorial explains the word to mean in this game.</p>
<p>In the Japanese version of FFXV, the segment of the Lore Guide entitled &#8220;The Six and the Oracle&#8221; ends with an additional line that says ちなみに、これらの話題でいう「星」は「世界」の意です &#8212; &#8220;By the way, &#8216;star&#8217; in these topics means &#8216;world.'&#8221; This either became &#8220;star&#8221; in the official English localization due to an error in translation or, as is more likely, a deliberate choice on the part of the localization to give some linguistic flair to the game&#8217;s dialogue.</p>
<p>Click here for a screenshot or here for a video showing this segment of the Lore Guide in the Japanese version, and for further reference, this is Luna&#8217;s line above in Japanese: クリスタルから力を得た真の王だけが星を脅かす敵を　倒すことができるのです]</p>
<p>[Back in the present, Noct hears Gentiana speak to him]<br />
Gentiana: Unto the King alone, this voice is heard.</p>
<p>[A storm begins across the entire Duscae region]<br />
Gentiana: To follow the words is to follow the chosen path. Bridging heaven and earth it strikes, the Storm&#8217;s ephemeral yet eternal light. To the Light must go the King.</p>
<p>Locate the three runestones of Ramuh hidden around Duscae.</p>
<p>Ignis: Lady Lunafreya has done well to keep the ring from falling into enemy hands.<br />
Prompto: All we need to do is hit Altissia.<br />
Ignis: That entails passage aboard a ship. Caem may serve us now as it did them then.<br />
Gladiolus: The hidden harbor&#8230; Hmph, just might work. I&#8217;ll have Iris set it up.<br />
Prompto: So, in the meantime&#8230;<br />
Noctis: We head into the Storm.<br />
Prompto: Another day, another deity.<br />

Gladiolus: Lady Lunafreya doing alright?<br />
Noctis: Probably. She pasted in a little nature stamp.<br />
Prompto: A stamp?<br />
Ignis: She&#8217;s opted for simpler modes of communication to indulge our indolent prince.<br />
Noctis: She usually sends pictures and flowers. I send back stickers and stuff.<br />
Prompto: Sounds like you two have some riveting conversations.<br />
&#8212;</p>

<p>(while traveling to the runestones)<br />
[Noct hears Gentiana&#8217;s voice again]<br />
Gentiana: Finite is the Oracle&#8217;s strength, and great is the toll of the covenant. Without the King, it will be too much to bear.<br />
Ignis: What is it?<br />
Noctis: Apparently all this is taking a toll on Luna, and I should go to her.<br />

(while traveling to the runestones)<br />
Gladiolus: First Titan, now Ramuh. Chasing down deities is hard work.<br />
Prompto: Think how Lady Lunafreya must feel.<br />
Ignis: If the strain of the rites is as Gentiana suggested, I fear she&#8217;s far worse off than we are.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while traveling to the runestones)<br />
Gladiolus: The hell? I can&#8217;t get a hold of her.<br />
Noctis: Iris?<br />
Gladiolus: She call you?<br />
Noctis: No messages.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while traveling to the runestones)<br />
Gladiolus: C&#8217;mon, pick up.<br />
Prompto: No luck?<br />
Gladiolus: Probably got her phone on silent.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(still while traveling to the runestones)<br />
Gladiolus: Still can&#8217;t get through.<br />
Ignis: Perhaps she&#8217;s unable to answer.<br />
Gladiolus: But I told her to be ready and pick up when I call.<br />
Prompto: Let&#8217;s hope she&#8217;s alright.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(still while traveling to the runestones)<br />
Gladiolus: All this time, he was the chancellor.<br />
Ignis: I&#8217;ve had suspicions, but that was well beyond them.<br />
Prompto: He&#8217;s awfully friendly for an enemy leader.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(still not there yet)<br />
Ignis: Our encounters with the chancellor seem more than mere chance.<br />
Prompto: See that guy everywhere.<br />
Noctis: I&#8217;ve seen enough of him.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(still while seeking out the runestones)<br />
Prompto: Oh, man, that was my first time being on a ship like that!<br />
Gladiolus: One more item to cross off the bucket list.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(still while seeking out the runestones)<br />
Prompto: So Iris&#8217;s story about Lady Lunafreya coming through town was true after all.<br />
Ignis: Judging by the timing of her visit, she probably set course for the Archaean as soon as she fled the Crown City.<br />
Gladiolus: You really owe her big time, Noct.<br />
Noctis: Can&#8217;t wait to thank her in person.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(still while seeking out the runestones)<br />
Prompto: How come that lady&#8217;s helping you out anyway?<br />
Noctis: Gentiana?<br />
Prompto: Yeah. Is she like your fairy godmother or something?<br />
Noctis: I think she&#8217;s more a Messenger of the gods.<br />
Prompto: Whoooaaa.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(still while seeking out the runestones)<br />
Prompto: So is Gentiana, y&#8217;know, human?<br />
Ignis: Not quite. While not exactly gods, Messengers are divine entities. Noctis: Just like the Oracle speaks to the gods for the people, the Messengers speak to the people for the gods.<br />
Prompto: So she&#8217;s Lady Lunafreya&#8217;s partner in divine.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(still while seeking out the runestones)<br />
Prompto: So if Gentiana&#8217;s not mortal, then she doesn&#8217;t ever grow older?<br />
Noctis: Yeah.<br />
Prompto: Ah, to be forever young&#8230;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(still while seeking out the runestones)<br />
Gladiolus: Amazing. The power of the gods in the palm of your hands.<br />
Ignis: Never dreamt I&#8217;d see lore come to life before my very eyes.<br />
Prompto: Leaving Insomnia was eye-opening, but this is mind-blowing.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(still while seeking out the runestones)<br />
Prompto: So Noct, right now you&#8217;re still gathering your powers, but what&#8217;ll you do once you&#8217;ve found &#8217;em all?<br />
Ignis: The calling is only a set of guiding principles.<br />
Gladio: Well, hopefully it&#8217;ll guide him into taking down the empire once and for all.<br />
Noct: Yeah, like the sound of that.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(still while seeking out the runestones)<br />
Prompto: What is the King&#8217;s calling exactly?<br />
Gladiolus: Well, become best buds with the gods, maybe?<br />
Ignis: Legend has it the King once stood alongside the Six in the battle to banish the darkness.<br />
Noctis: &#8216;Darkness&#8217; seems awfully vague.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while still at it)<br />
Prompto: We&#8217;re still gonna visit the other royal tombs, right?<br />
Ignis: Of course. We&#8217;ve simply gone off-road for a spell.<br />
Gladiolus: Noct could definitely use a hand from his ancestors.<br />
Ignis: The dead can wait, but gods aren&#8217;t always forgiving. Let us not keep the Fulgurian waiting.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(and still at it)<br />
Gladiolus: After Ramuh, we go see Leviathan, right?<br />
Ignis: Indeed. I daresay Lady Lunafreya seeks the Hydraean as we speak.<br />
Prompto: Which means another rite, and a heavier burden. I hope she can hold up.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(here too)<br />
Prompto: Umbra&#8217;s the only one making deliveries. Wonder what Pryna&#8217;s up to?<br />
Ignis: Haven&#8217;t seen her.<br />
Gladio: Probably because she&#8217;s traveling around with her owner.<br />
Prompto: Y&#8217;know, I really miss that dog.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(and here)<br />
Prompto: Now where did that car of ours drive off to?<br />
Gladiolus: We&#8217;d better find her before we set sail.<br />
Noctis: Can&#8217;t leave the old girl behind.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(also here)<br />
Ignis: You don&#8217;t appreciate what you have &#8217;til it&#8217;s gone.<br />
Prompto: Man, in that car, we were unstoppable.<br />
Gladiolus: She was our home away from home.<br />
Noctis: Yeah&#8230;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(here as well)<br />
Prompto: Cindy is the sweetest girl ever.<br />
Gladiolus: Here we go again.<br />
Prompto: Going out of her way to help us these past couple of days&#8230; I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s had better things to do.<br />
Noctis: All for a lost cause. Now I feel bad for turning down the courtesy car.<br />
Ignis: A courtesy car&#8217;s no Regalia.<br />
Prompto: Would&#8217;ve felt like cheating.<br />
Gladiolus: Besides, Cindy&#8217;s a big girl.<br />
Prompto: So&#8230;you think she&#8217;ll call again soon?<br />
Gladiolus: Soon, huh? Not soon enough for you, loverboy.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(ditto)<br />
Gladiolus: If the ferry at Galdin were running, we&#8217;d probably be in Altissia by now.<br />
Prompto: The port&#8217;s still closed?<br />
Ignis: Safe to assume until we hear news to the contrary.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(likewise)<br />
Prompto: I&#8217;ve never heard of Caem before. Is it famous?<br />
Ignis: Not among the masses, but its harbor was home to His Majesty&#8217;s ship.<br />
Gladiolus: Bet everything&#8217;s just the way he left it thirty years ago.<br />
Prompto: So we found a harbor. Do we have a ship?<br />
Noctis: Maybe?<br />
Gladiolus: If not, we&#8217;ll find one of those, too.<br />
Prompto: Uh, how?<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(the same)<br />
Gladiolus: The earthquakes—they&#8217;ve died down.<br />
Prompto: Oh, yeah, forgot about those.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(and again)<br />
Gladiolus: Where&#8217;s the damn sun?<br />
Prompto: Yeah&#8230;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(and again)<br />
Prompto: Anyone else feel like stopping back home?<br />
Noctis: Not before we take back what&#8217;s ours.<br />
Gladiolus: Alright, now that&#8217;s what I like to hear!<br />
Ignis: It&#8217;s not merely taking back—it&#8217;s payback as well.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(and one more time)<br />
Ignis: Noct, what are your plans for after reuniting with Lady Lunafreya?<br />
Gladiolus: Not exactly like you can bring her along for the ride.<br />
Prompto: Think you might still pull off a wedding?<br />
Noctis: We&#8217;ll cross that bridge when we come to it.<br />
&#8212;</p>

<p>(as Noctis reaches the first runestone)<br />
[He touches it, and is swarmed by lightning as he does so, experiencing another flashback to his time in Tenebrae as a child; Noct awakens from sleep in a wheelchair, the Cosmogony in his lap; Gentiana is sitting in a chair a few feet from him]<br />
Gentiana: Ah, the young prince is recovering well.<br />
Noctis: Who&#8230;?<br />
Gentiana: Gentiana, a Messenger. The prince has read of our kind?</p>
<p>[Noct looks confused for a moment, then looks down at the Cosmogony in his hands]<br />
Noctis: Oh! I tried to, but I only know what Luna told me.<br />
Gentiana: Lady Lunafreya.<br />
Noctis: Yeah, Lunarffr&#8230;Luna.</p>
<p>[Looking embarrassed, Noctis pulls the Cosmogony over most of his face; Gentiana smiles]<br />
Gentiana: It is heartening to see the future King and the Oracle enjoy such familiarity. The fate of our world may depend on it.</p>
<p>[Noct&#8217;s mind returns to the present]<br />
Noctis: I remember&#8230; Back in Tenebrae with Gentiana&#8230;</p>
<p>[Noct hears Gentiana&#8217;s voice once again]<br />
Gentiana: The revelation of the Stormsender awaits the King&#8230; Hurry hence to the eye of the Storm. Foreign hordes fear the True King&#8217;s ascension. The fearful seek to seal the path of what must come.<br />
Prompto: What is it? Another headache?<br />
Noctis: I heard her—Gentiana.<br />
Gladiolus: Divine voices in your head again?<br />
Ignis: Hopefully it won&#8217;t amount to the same headache it did with the Archaean.<br />

(on the way to the second runestone)<br />

Gentiana: The Oracle&#8217;s call awakens the gods&#8230; &#8230;that their blessings find the King.<br />
Ignis: You alright? What did she say?<br />
Noct: That Luna&#8217;s awakening the Six.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(on the way to the second runestone)<br />

Gentiana: The covenant is forged, but the revelation awaits. Make now for the Stormsender and let judgment be passed.<br />
Prompto: Noct! You okay?<br />
Noctis: Yeah. Another reminder to receive the blessing.<br />
Gladiolus: That divine power&#8217;s just waiting for you.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(still on the way to the second runestone)<br />
[Noct hears Gentiana&#8217;s voice yet again]<br />
Gentiana: By revelation is the power of the Six manifest. The Stone commands that the King receive it.<br />

Gentiana: O King. Journey to Fociaugh, the eastern hollow.</p>
<p>[Several lightning bolts converge and crash together in the same spot in the distance]<br />
Gentiana: The seal has been lifted. Deep within the heart of rock lies the runestone, the portal to power. No other can be allowed to find it.<br />
Noctis: The last one&#8217;s in the cave.<br />
Gladiolus: Let&#8217;s hurry up and get this over with.<br />
Prompto: Finally! Time to meet with the Stormsender!<br />
Ignis: You&#8217;d better look your best.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Once Noct and the royal retinue get within about 300 feet of Fociaugh Hollow, a lightning bolt strikes the ground a short distance ahead of them]<br />
[Note: The audio here has Prompto say &#8220;Whoa!&#8221;]<br />
Gladio: That one was pretty close.<br />
Ignis: Which means we must be as well.<br />

Ignis: I can&#8217;t quite make out how deep it runs.<br />

Prompto: On second thought&#8230;maybe not!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as they proceed further into the tunnel on the other side of the tight passage)<br />
Gladiolus: Shhh. Keep quiet.<br />
Prompto: Who? What? Where?<br />
Gladiolus: I don&#8217;t know, but I don&#8217;t like it.<br />
Ignis: Stay alert, everyone.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[As the Chocobros continue, they come to a small opening requiring them to crouch to proceed; they do]<br />

[Note: The audio here has Gladio at first make a sound like &#8220;Iunno&#8221;]<br />
Gladio: Something about her &#8220;baby.&#8221;<br />
Prompto: If it&#8217;s anything like her, I ain&#8217;t going near it. Do you guys see anything!?<br />
Gladio: Nothing that&#8217;s gonna snatch ya up.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>[Noctis and his retinue crouch to get under one more rock wall, then proceed; they come across the door to another Menace Dungeon]<br />
Prompto: Oh, lucky day! Look what we have here. Awesome.<br />
Ignis: So, we&#8217;ve found yet another door.<br />
Prompto: Let&#8217;s get this over with.<br />
Noctis: As you wish.<br />
Gladiolus: I was hopin&#8217; you&#8217;d say that.</p>
<p>(upon trying the door)<br />
The door is locked.</p>
<p>Noctis: No luck. Guess we&#8217;ll need another key.<br />
Ignis: The key question is, &#8220;Where do we look?&#8221;<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the Chocobros make it to the last runestone)<br />
Ignis: That&#8217;s the last runestone.<br />
Prompto: Finally.<br />
Gladiolus: Alright, you&#8217;re up, Noct.</p>
<p>[Noct touches it and, as lightning swarms around him, sees a flash in his mind of Luna forging the covenant with Ramuh]</p>
<p>Mark of the Fulgurian x 1</p>
<p>Noctis: This is it&#8230;the power of the Storm.<br />
Prompto: Eh, I expected more fire and brimstone.<br />
Gladiolus: Some gods are friendlier than others, I guess.<br />
Noctis: But not all of &#8217;em. Poor Luna&#8230;<br />
Ignis: Perhaps you had better console her in person.<br />
Prompto: Just a boat ride away!<br />
Gladiolus: Lose that scowl along the way.<br />
Noct: Will do.</p>
<p>Noctis acquired the Mark of the Fulgurian, a symbol of Ramuh&#8217;s favor!<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as Noct and his retinue return to the surface)<br />
Prompto: Hey, it stopped raining!<br />
Gladiolus: Guess Ramuh finally got sick of showers.</p>
<p>[An enormous winged ship flies overhead]<br />
Gladiolus: Up there—it&#8217;s huge!<br />
Prompto: Way bigger than the last one we saw!</p>
<p>[Noctis&#8217;s cell phone rings; he answers]<br />
Noct: Yeah.<br />
Cindy: Hey, Highness. About your car&#8230;<br />
Noct: Yeah?<br />
Cindy: Well, I found her, but she&#8217;s at a base.<br />
Noct: Ugh&#8230;<br />
Cindy: Now, I can handle garage folk no problem, but sweet-talkin&#8217; the empire? That&#8217;ll take some doing.<br />
Noct: Don&#8217;t worry about it.<br />
Cindy: Yeah?<br />
Noct: We&#8217;ll figure it out.<br />
Cindy: You sure about that?<br />
Noct: Yeah, thanks for the heads up. Later.<br />
Gladiolus: Who was that?<br />
Noct: Cindy.<br />
Prompto: What!? You can&#8217;t talk to her like that.<br />
Noct: Yeah, I can. I just did.<br />
Ignis: And did she have any choice words for you?<br />
Noct: Yeah—the Regalia&#8217;s at an imperial base.<br />
Prompto: Oh boy.<br />
Gladiolus: Guess that just leaves one question:<br />
Ignis: &#8220;When do we retrieve her?&#8221;<br />
Noct: I&#8217;d say &#8220;now.&#8221;<br />
Ignis: This is nothing more than conjecture, but I suspect that ship was due to arrive far earlier. The thunder and lightning must&#8217;ve slowed it down. There&#8217;s a chance they intend to transport the Regalia back to Niflheim.<br />
Gladiolus: We oughta thank the thunder god for buying us some time.<br />
Prompto: But that time is running out.<br />
Noct: Yeah, let&#8217;s run in and ride off.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(approaching Aracheole Stronghold)<br />
Noctis: Some kind of fortress.<br />
Gladio: Yeah, port-a-fortress. Those walls don&#8217;t look so portable, though.<br />
Ignis: They are remnants of the Old War, and the imperial army has availed itself of the added protection. Entry will not be easy.</p>
<p>Make camp at Sothmocke Haven and devise an infiltration strategy.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the royal retinue prepares to infiltrate Aracheole Stronghold to reclaim the Regalia)<br />
Noct: So, any bright ideas, Ignis?<br />
Ignis: A dark one, as it were. A frontal assault would leave us exposed. But, if we move under cover of night, we might be able to infiltrate the base unnoticed.<br />
Noct: And until then?<br />
Ignis: We learn all we can about the base&#8217;s design and narrow down the Regalia&#8217;s location. I&#8217;ll analyze what intelligence we have available to find us a way in.<br />
Noctis: Sounds good, Specs.<br />
Prompto: Alright! We&#8217;re gonna get our wheels back!</p>
<p>[A prompt appears saying &#8220;Noctis must retrieve the Regalia before dawn. Begin the operation?&#8221; and asking the player to select either &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No&#8221;]<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(upon selecting &#8220;Yes&#8221;)<br />
Undaunted by the empire&#8217;s imposing technology, Noctis and his retinue risk everything to break inside Aracheole Stronghold and recover the stolen Regalia.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(while sneaking around Aracheole Stronghold)<br />
Gladiolus: Take cover.<br />
Noctis: It&#8217;s gone.<br />
Ignis: Magitek armor.<br />
Gladio: Don&#8217;t wanna mess with one of those.<br />
Ignis: We shouldn&#8217;t have to if we keep to the shadows.<br />
Noctis: Right.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the battle in Aracheole Stronghold becomes drawn out)<br />
Ignis: We&#8217;re sorely overmatched, Noct. Let us retreat.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(gaining the option to summon Ramuh for the first time during the battle in Aracheole Stronghold)<br />
Ramuh, the Fulgurian, has deigned to support the struggling king. Noctis can call upon the god&#8217;s powers to defeat his foes.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after summoning Ramuh for the first time inside Aracheole Stronghold)<br />
Noctis: This is the might of the Six&#8230;<br />
Prompto: Dude&#8230;that&#8230;was&#8230;hardcore!<br />
Ignis: And it did the trick—the place is dead.<br />
Gladiolus: Rest in pieces. C&#8217;mon, let&#8217;s grab the Regalia and split.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(on the way to retake the Regalia inside the base)<br />
Prompto: Piece of cake, huh?<br />
Gladiolus: Hmph, this part is.<br />
Ignis: Inadvertent though it was, we dealt the empire a crushing blow today. The marshal will be pleased to hear of this.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(still heading for the Regalia inside the base)<br />
Prompto: Pretty sweet, busting up that base. &#8220;Bust-a-base&#8221;&#8230; I like the sound of that for this sort of thing. There&#8217;s a base—we go in and bust it up. Bust-a-base! Whatever, I&#8217;m calling it that. You don&#8217;t have to.<br />
Noctis: I won&#8217;t.<br />
Ignis: It seems a bit flippant.<br />
Gladio: Why not go for something a little more epic?<br />
Prompto: Because I thought of it first, so that&#8217;s the name. &#8220;Bust-a-base&#8221;—get used to it.<br />
Noctis: Easier said than done.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as the Chocobros reach the Regalia)<br />
[Looking behind them, Prompto sees something]<br />
Prompto: Guys?</p>
<p>[Ravus approaches, his sword drawn at the ready in his right hand]<br />
Ravus: Long has it been, Noctis.<br />
Noctis: Ravus.<br />
Ravus: You receive the Storm&#8217;s blessing. And yet, you know nothing of the consequences.</p>
<p>[Ravus raises the point of his sword to Noctis&#8217;s throat]<br />
Gladiolus: Watch it.</p>
<p>[Gladio moves to get between them; Ravus repositions the blade with its edge now along Gladio&#8217;s throat; Ignis starts to move toward Ravus, but the other man raises his left hand]<br />
Ravus: Be still. All of you.<br />
Prompto: Not good.<br />
Ravus: Heir to a crown befitting no other. Witness his splendor and glory. All hail the Chosen King.<br />
Noctis: Awful high and mighty for an imperial rat, serving the enemy to hunt down Luna!</p>
<p>[Ravus suddenly grabs Noctis&#8217;s throat with his left hand]<br />
Ravus: I do not serve. I command!</p>
<p>[Ravus shoves Noctis backward; Gladio gets between them]<br />
Ravus: The king&#8217;s sworn shield.<br />
Gladiolus: You better believe it.<br />
Ravus: A weak shield protects naught.</p>
<p>[Ravus slowly raises his sword above his head, then brings it down fiercely; Gladio briefly blocks it with his own sword before Ravus parries the weapon away and slams the pommel of his sword into Gladio&#8217;s chest, sending him flying into the side of the Regalia; Prompto runs to check on Gladio while Noct gets between them and Ravus]<br />
Noctis: Wanna go? Let&#8217;s do it.</p>
<p>[Noct&#8217;s Royal Arms begin spinning around him]<br />
Ravus: Should the Chosen fail, that too is fate.</p>
<p>[Ardyn suddenly appears]<br />
Ardyn: I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s far enough. A hand, Highness?<br />
Noctis: Not from you.<br />
Ardyn: Oh, but I&#8217;m here to help.<br />
Ignis: And how is that?<br />
Ardyn: By taking the army away.<br />
Gladiolus: You expect us to believe that?<br />
Ardyn: When next we meet, it&#8217;ll be across the seas. Just so happens we have business of our own with the tutelary deity. Don&#8217;t we?</p>
<p>[Ardyn looks at Ravus]<br />
Ardyn: Fare thee well, Your Majesty, and safe travels.</p>
<p>[Ravus and Ardyn walk away]<br />
Prompto: You guys know that guy?<br />
Ignis: Ravus Nox Fleuret, first son of Tenebrae&#8230;and elder brother to Lady Lunafreya.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(as Noct and his retinue drive away from Aracheole Stronghold in the Regalia)<br />
Newscaster<br />
At long last imperial blockades of Duscaen roadways have been removed. The imperial army has also demolished all related facilities erected around the region. The provisional government of Insomnia anticipates increased traffic congestion along most local highways, and encourages all citizens to refrain from any unnecessary travel for the time being.</p>
<p>Prompto: So help me figure this out—that was Luna&#8217;s brother?<br />
Ignis: The high commander himself—wartime makes for quick promotions.<br />
Gladiolus: Even a son of Tenebrae can rise to the top.<br />
Prompto: But why would he want to lead their army?<br />
Noctis: Who cares?<br />
Ignis: Certainly formidable enough on his own.<br />
Noctis: If Ravus wants power, I&#8217;ll give him a taste.<br />

(after summoning Titan the first time)<br />
Gladiolus: You mind explaining what that was?<br />
Prompto: My guess would be&#8230;Titan?<br />
Noctis: That was&#8230;more than I expected.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after summoning on another occasion)<br />
Noctis: Takes a lot out of me.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after summoning on yet another occasion)<br />
Prompto: Why don&#8217;t we just do that every time?<br />
Noctis: Easy for you to say!<br />
Prompto: Yes, yes it is.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after summoning yet another time)<br />
Prompto: I know now. I know why the tales are told.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after summoning yet one other time)<br />
Ignis: Is the storm ready to rage?<br />
Noctis: Just say when.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after yet another summoning)<br />
Gladiolus: Y&#8217;know, at first it was weird, but I&#8217;m getting used to it.<br />
Prompto: The whole &#8220;summoning help&#8221; thing?<br />
Noctis: Be weirder if you weren&#8217;t used to it by now.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(following another summoning)<br />
Ignis: Thank heavens for that.<br />
Prompto: Nothing like the divine to get you out of a bind.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(following yet another summoning)<br />
Ignis: There, but by the grace of the gods, go we mortals.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>(after another summoning)<br />
Noctis: Weather cleared up.<br />

<p>[When the Chocobros return to the Leville Hotel in Lestallum, they find Iris waiting for them in the lobby]<br />
Iris: Oh, Gladdy.<br />
Gladio: What&#8217;s wrong?<br />
Iris: I let you down. I never made it to Caem. The empire came while you were gone.</p>
<p>[The scene transitions to their hotel room upstairs]<br />
Iris: None of us said a word about Noct. They just showed up and then&#8230;poor Jared.<br />
Gladio: What do you mean? What happened to Jared!?<br />
Iris: There was nothing we could do!</p>
<p>[The door to the room slowly opens behind Noctis; Taloctt is there, crying; Noct gets down on one knee to speak with him]<br />
Noctis: It&#8217;s&#8230;not right. We should&#8217;ve been here.<br />
Talcott: I&#8230; I couldn&#8217;t stop them.<br />
Noctis: But I won&#8217;t let the empire get away with it. They&#8217;ll pay for what they&#8217;ve done. I promise.<br />
Talcott: I believe in you, Prince Noctis.</p>
<p>[Talcott walks away]<br />
Iris: I&#8217;m taking Talcott, and we&#8217;re going to Caem. We&#8230; We can&#8217;t just stay here and do nothing.<br />
Noctis: I understand.<br />
&#8212;</p>
