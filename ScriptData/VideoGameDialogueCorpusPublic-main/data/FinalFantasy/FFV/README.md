# Final Fantasy V

## Source

This is a parsing of the game script here: https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/02/09/final-fantasy-anthology-game-script-586532. While there are some problems with some of the FinalFantasyQuotes parsings, this one looks correct.

## Gender Coding

The books and bookshelves actually speak.

Espers/Summons generally have assigned genders, so I've moved them from neutral where appropriate (NB "Leviathan" is sometimes female and sometimes male in different installments, and its gender isn't clear here - on some wiki pages its described as "he" and in other places as "it", so I've left as neutral). I've also changed the coding for "Boco" (as he is referred to with male pronouns in the wiki and mates with a female chocobo in "The Merged World") and "Byblos" (referred to with male pronouns). 

"Left Tower" and "Right Tower" are combinations of party members when the party splits into two groups. I've coded as neutral as there are various possible combinations. 

The "Pirates" are called "guys" in game. "Wolf" is the werewolf "Tsuze" (aka "Fang"/"Tuss") and is male. The other werewolves aren't clearly male or female, so I've coded neutral.
