You'll need to hurry to the garden before all the water leaks out. Oh no, did all the water leak out? Here, let me refill it for you. Was there enough water for the plot? Only half? I see. Well, let me refill the jug for you. All done? Then we just need to speak to ... Ersabel, was it?",

				"Wonderful! Thank you for your help.",
				"I've got it! I'll lead by asking how business is, then mention you, and then ask about the route. That ... should work, right?",
				"(sniff) I'm fine. Really. It's just been a long day.",
				"Then we can finally go to Nabaath Areng.",
				"Before we go ... While you were away with Forename , I prepared an extra set of cartridges for you. And this one. It's the practice cartridge you gave me. I know I should've thrown it away ages ago, but I've been adding a little extra to it every day. After so many charges, I'm honestly not sure what it will do. But I wanted you to have it. For luck.",

				"This is the place, Forename . This is where she stopped the Flood. The last time I was here, when I felt her presence overwhelming me ... I tried to pretend it wasn't happening─to just ... turn away. But I can't turn away now. Not this time. For Thancred and the others, I have to face her.",
				"Sorry I couldn't be of more help. By the sounds of it, you have a knack for handling strange requests. On the bright side, Urianger taught me a lot about the Talos and their hearts. I think I can help if they need further repairs.",
				"I shouldn't be here. I don't deserve to be. I don't deserve any of the things you've done for me! I'm just a burden, helpless and hopeless. If tomorrow came and I was gone, it would be better for everyone! Thancred most of all. He'll never admit it, but I can see it in his eyes ... I wish he'd just say it─just say that he hates me! That he wishes I was dead so that she could return ... ",
				"(sniff) I'm fine. Really. It's just been a long day.",
				"Runar. Thank goodness.",
				"You have something on your mind. What is it?",
				"Do you really think he can bring her back?",
				"Urianger once told me that being immersed in the Lifestream can cause irreparable harm to the body. Do you suppose Y'shtola is all right?",
				"Thancred mentioned Y'shtola's passion for learning. I expect the tablet is ... just the sort of thing she'd like?",
				"I know I have no reason to, but I can't help feeling nervous about meeting Y'shtola.",
				"If ... if you really want to stay, then help us fight.",
				"Thancred has told me of the Ascians and what they have done. If he isn't willing to help, is it wise to let him stay with us?",
				"Urianger said they were rebuilding, but ... there's no one here.",
				"I didn't expect her to be so ... imposing in person.",
				"Have you ever seen such a tree? To think these are only the roots!",
				"He understands that I'm not the same. That I'm not her.",
				"Is─is everyone all right? What in the─",
				"Where ... where is Y'shtola?",
				"Why would she do such a thing?",
				"Let me come with you! I have the blessing too!",
				"I wish there were more I could do. Please be careful ... ",
				"Oh! I'm sorry. I was ... stuck in my own head again. It's clear that Magnus has no intention of helping us, but perhaps we should ask the other residents? They may know something of the trolley. I'll take the north side of town. Let me know if you learn anything!",
				"Considering the Blessed have only just recovered from their encounter with the Eulmorans, Thancred and the others thought we should stay a while longer to be sure they're all right. They're such a kind and caring people. I pray they never again have to face such hardship.",
				"Thanks to the antidote, all those who were poisoned will make a full recovery.",
				"I know he said he would be watching from the shadows, but doesn't it seem wrong to leave without at least telling Emet-Selch?",
				"A quest for a lost love ... Perhaps that could have been me, had things been different.",
				"The town is small, but everything in it seems so purposeful. It's amazing.",
				" ... No. We must reach Nabaath Areng. I must.",
				"He only said that because ... because he thinks I'm weak. And he's right. But I can't be─I won't be forever. There has to be some way ... I must find it.",
				" ... ",
				"Eep! Oh, Forename . What are you doing here?",
				"Thancred ... It's my fault, you know. I jumped at the chance to help Lyna, but I was careless. And now ... It's my fault.",
				"I ... are you sure? I've brought him nothing but trouble thus far. And what if it's worse, next time? All I do is make mistakes, put others in danger ... I'm sure that he'll resent me. For being this weak. Maybe he already does.",
				"Oh, what have I done? I promised I'd be right back, and yet here I am ... I know that I need to be better. I'm only allowed to be a part of this because I'm Minfilia, and I need to be ... more like her. All I do is make mistakes, put others in danger ... ",
				"But you're right. I can still help─if only by seeing these herbs safely to Chessamile.",
				"I asked someone who looked like they knew what they were doing, and they pointed me toward the herb I was looking for right away! I hope you didn't have too much trouble with yours.",
				"(gasp)",
				"I-I wasn't spying on you or anything. I've just finished my task, and ... ",
				"I ... I should go and report back.",
				"What do you suppose she's gleaned from the tablet?",
				"And you think this ancient petition will somehow help us get into Yx'Maja?",
				"Where can we find this monument?",
				" ... All right. I'll stay here until you return.",
				"Take care, Forename .",
				"Why would she do such a thing?",
				"What about Y'shtola ... ?",
				"All right.",
				"If I were stronger ... how many people would still be alive?",
				"The Wardens harbor vast reservoirs of primordial Light, do they not?",
				"Don't what? Do what I can? What we both know is right!?",
				"But I do! I know why you never said anything. Because you thought you could keep me safe by keeping me in the dark. And ... maybe I thought so too. But I knew, Thancred. I always knew!",
				"I'm sorry to be so insistent. But I know this is the only way. If you're willing to give me a chance, come with us.",
				"Sorry for the wait─I'm ready now.",
				"Look ... no matter what happens to me, I'm sure that I don't want to go back to being who I was.",
				"Thank you. I'll try not to disappoint.",
				"We'll need to move quickly. The longer the others need to keep the Eulmorans busy, the more likely they are to be caught.",
				"I'm ready. Let's go.",
				"This place has been scarred by the Flood too. Who can say what lies ahead?",
				"Urianger once told me that being immersed in the Lifestream can cause irreparable harm to the body.",
				"I can't imagine what could have survived in there after so many years ... ",
				"To think we'll be the first people in thousands of years to set foot inside this place. It's humbling. Knowing they've entrusted us with the history of their people. With their legacy ... ",
				"The Lightwarden is dead. The Blessed's prayers have been answered ... ",
				"How can you tell?",
				"You recognize these scenes?",
				"Thancred did tell me about primals ... but I don't fully understand what all of this means.",
				"Oh dear ... Is there anything else that we should know?",
				"Forgive me ... but I'm not sure I understand ... ",
				"They're so fluffy, it's like touching a cloud!",
				"I dare not ask what happened in our absence ... ",
				"I was taught never to talk to the Fuath under any circumstances ... Are you sure this is a good idea ... ?",

				"I can fight too. I promise I won't be a burden.",
				"E-Excuse me, Forename , but I couldn't help overhearing. If you mean to undertake this task, will you let me accompany you?",
				"I would learn from you ... and help in what little way I can.",
				"Thank you so much!",
				"Thank you! I promise I won't be a burden!",
				"Father Collard's Chambers is through here. I peered inside, and sure enough, it was milling with Nu Mou. They looked none too friendly.",
				"If Thancred were here, he'd tell me to go about it quietly and quickly. Let us split up.",
				"I'll find all the ink I can and then come back outside. See you shortly, Forename .",
				"I hope you've had more luck than I ... ",
				" ... It would be them! Thank you, you've been a great help!",
				"What a sight ... Oh, pardon me! It's only ... It's a bit daunting, isn't it?",
				"This lever can't have been designed for a person to operate ... ",
				"The levers for switching tracks looked like they were in good condition",
				"I feel a bit bad for them ... ",
				"Um, if I may─we're actually searching for a means by which to travel to Nabaath Areng.",
				"Well, is there anything we could do to assist you?",
				"I hope Jeryk doesn't get in trouble for telling us what happened.",
				"This is all my fault. I never should have pressured him.",
				"She's not gone. No matter what you say or believe, she's not. We can still bring her back.",
				"Why must he always treat me like this ... ",
