The weather will change depending on which levers you use. There are four possible combinations-- and four possible weather conditions. There is a correlation between monsters and the weather. For example, if you make it rain, the monsters near watering holes will become more vicious. And rare monsters with extraordinary strength may appear.

Is Atlas unstable, or is its main physical component flawed in some fashion? There's also the possibility it uses an advanced form of camouflage. We scientists don't even know how to wield a weapon, but I guess we'll have to learn how to take care of ourselves someday.",
