# Final Fantasy XIII-2

This is a transcript of the Playstation 3 version.

The transcriber states that:

What is included:

- The complete script for all mandatory content
- The complete script for most optional content, including fragment
quests and optional areas
- All paradox endings and the secret ending


What is not included:

- Most of the alternate Live Trigger options - these will be added as
time permits
- Certain dialogues if Noel leads instead of Serah
- Optional and auto-talk conversations for certain areas, most
particularly Academia 4XX AF and Serendipity
- Additional auto-talks in certain areas
- Certain dialogues if you choose to not to accept a fragment quest
or if you don't have the item to complete one
- Anything from downloadable content (DLC) - I haven't yet played any of
this for my own reasons - this may be included at a later date
- The recaps of Final Fantasy XIII available from the opening menu -
I do plan to add these
- Codes for navigation
- Transcriptions of the Fragment entries or Datalogs that can be read in
the menu. You can find most, if not all of these, at Final Fantasy Wiki
if you want to read them.
- Treasures or fragments that aren't accompanied by dialogue - if the
party is given a treasure automatically or as part of a quest that is
accompanied by dialogue, then I have noted it in the script, but
otherwise no
- Anything else that can be read in the menu, but isn't part of the
dialogue
- Explanatory primers or tutorials that are presented as text-only,
though I will note when they are presented if they are given
automatically

## Live Triggers

Not all options for Live Triggers are transcribed. Some have multiple options for the same button, which can happen if you return to the trigger again. These are represented as embedded.

## Multiple options

The transcriber sometimes transcribes multiple responses to declining in a "Yes/No" choice. These are represented as alternative options, though they may be heard several times.

Lines that come from parts where you can talk to NPCs multiple times are marked with {"_TalkAgain": "True"}


## Parsing

Orthography for "sped up talking": replace dashes with spaces. e.g.:

"Serah: He-has-this-amazing-body-and-his-face-is-so-handsome-he's-tall-and-broad-and-makes-me-feel-so-safe!"

## Coding Notes
- "Female Voice" is the Academy Datanet voice in Academia - i.e. the synthetic Announcer voice (as per the trope). 
- Some of the generic NPCs might refer to different instances (e.g. 'Guard') - given the narrative of the game (temporal paradoxes, replaying levels with slight differences) it's difficult to say. However, they are likely to share a sprite (this is similar to the 'soldier' cases in other FF games.) Note these generics are usually male; the source tends to point out exceptions.  
- "Proto fal'Cie Adam" - coded as 'genderless' as per the wiki. 
- "Patrolling Men" can be any combination of Patrolling Man 1-6 (depending on who is proximate to the battle). 
- Some of the numbers of the patrolling men aren't consistent in the source - so, for instance, a man with a purple top and trousers might be 'Patrolling Man 2' in one cluster of dialogue and 'Patrolling Man 4' in another. Where possible I've identified these and amended them, but it wasn't possible to verify every line (and indeed, some lines aren't captured in the source). However, the following still holds: there are six numbered 'Patrolling Man' NPCs who move around outside New Bodhum, they are all male in appearance, and none have obviously more lines than another. 
- Two of the female nora members outside NORA house are identical sprites (purple haired, orange jackets), but they're distinct in personality and location. They've been coded separately ("Roaming Female NORA Member" and "Roaming Female NORA Member 2" in accordance with source naming).
