red, and pink near bazaar entrance): If I could find a way to curry favor with Lord Vayne, I&rsquo;d need never worry about money again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rabanastran (light blue seeq): They&rsquo;ll be starting that fete in the palace soon. Ah, the food they&rsquo;ll have&hellip; What I wouldn&rsquo;t give for just a taste!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rabanastran (man in hat and brown and green shorts): I can finally go home to Lowtown now! Maybe I&rsquo;ll pay Old Dalan a visit. He&rsquo;s always got a tall tale or two to tell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Traveler: Under Vayne&rsquo;s rule, Rabanastre will flourish as never before. I&rsquo;m sure of it! I may even consider moving here myself!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Imperial: The ceremony&rsquo;s over. You&rsquo;re free to move about Lowtown and pass through the city gates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rabanastran (blue seeq): So the ceremony ended without incident, eh? Good! I don&rsquo;t care much for the Empire, but I care even less for trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Dispirited Woman: Vayne invaded Nalbina&hellip; Basch wouldn&rsquo;t accept surrender and killed the King&hellip; Enemies of Dalmasca both, in my book.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rabanastran (black bangaa): The Empire wouldn&rsquo;t send someone like Vayne just anywhere. No, this says something about Dalmasca&rsquo;s importance to the Empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Riby: I didn&rsquo;t understand a word of that speech, but I&rsquo;ll get Old Dalan to explain it to me. There&rsquo;s no one knows more than he does!</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Rabanastran (man in tan and white): That new consul &ndash; he looks like some kind of general to me. Which means he was probably involved in the attack on Nalbina. Why would they send someone like </span><span class="c8">him </span><span class="c2">to rule us?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Rabanastran (woman in pink, yellow, and blue on bridge): I can never find my way to Lowtown when I need to. There should be a stairway around here </span><span class="c8">some</span><span class="c2">where&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rabanastran (woman in white with hat): The guards are letting people into Lowtown again, but I still can&rsquo;t find the stairs! My map shows a stairway over by the gambit shop, but I can&rsquo;t make head nor tail of it.</span></p><h3 class="c12" id="h.ad8n2eg29ozs"><span class="c13">Yamoora&rsquo;s Gambits</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Greenhorn: This is my first time in Yamoora&rsquo;s. I was just getting an explanation about gambits from this kid here. It&rsquo;s all about efficiency, he says.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Adept Adventurer: Did I watch the parade? Does a forest watch the ocean? Parades are nothing to one traveling the Way of the Gambit. Seek me out when the Way of the Gambit is open to you. I will lead you down its path.</span></p><h3 class="c12" id="h.4j7cqr5iciu0"><span class="c13">East End</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Johm: This new, uh, consul&hellip; He&rsquo;s one of the ones that attacked Dalmasca, isn&rsquo;t he? Why&rsquo;d it have to be someone like him&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rabanastran (man in hat and brown shorts outside Yugri&rsquo;s): I wish there were some way to sneak into that fete tonight. Wouldn&rsquo;t mind gettin&rsquo; my hands on some of them eatables, eh?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rabanastran (light blue seeq): This is a big night for Migelo. He&rsquo;s in charge of the preparations for the fete, isn&rsquo;t he? Let&rsquo;s hope it goes off without a hitch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rabanastran (tan bangaa with blindfold): I&rsquo;d heard they were bringing in one of these &ldquo;highborn&rdquo; to be the new consul, but the son of the Emperor himself? Never expected that!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rabanastran (woman in green and pink): At last, we can finally go back to Lowtown. I&rsquo;ve had enough of these Imperials and their meaningless rules! I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;ve let my tongue get the better of me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wistful Bangaa: At least this new consul seems better than the last. &lsquo;Course, the King and Princess, they&hellip; oh, forget I said anythin&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Rabanastran (kid in brown who tells stories about Rabanastre</span><span class="c2 c19">):</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So Lowtown&rsquo;s the place where most of us people in Rabanastre live. There are stairs down to Lowtown here in the East End, and, uh&hellip; Oh yeah! The North End and Southgate, too! Hmm, I may need to get some better material if I expect people to keep coming, huh. Maybe I&rsquo;ll go talk to Old Dalan and see if he has any good stories I can&hellip; borrow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lonely Boy: I sure feel sorry for all the people what got forced to move down to Lowtown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rabanastran (guy in green and brown shorts on bridge): So, whaddaya think? Will Migelo be able to call this new consul by his first name tonight? Honestly, I don&rsquo;t think he has it in him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rabanastran (blue seeq near market entrance): Sure, the parade was fun, but it wasn&rsquo;t that hearty belly laugh kind o&rsquo; fun. You get me? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rabanastran (man in green and brown shorts near Panamis&rsquo;s): We&rsquo;re nothing but servants groveling at the feet of the Empire&hellip; Seeing Migelo at the ceremony today was enough to remind me of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Town Gossip: Quite a parade, wasn&rsquo;t it? I always feel a little sad when something like that ends&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bucco: Hey, Vaan. I saw you and Penelo together during the parade. You sly dog&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Rabanastran (black bangaa chatting with seeq): My friend here says there are 22,505 cobblestones in the Southern Plaza &lsquo;round the corner, not including the tiles in the fountain. But even with the stones by the city gates&hellip; &lsquo;Course, he could be countin&rsquo; the flagstones, too. That would be another matter altogether</span><span class="c2 c19">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Imperial: The Consul&rsquo;s appointment ceremony may be over, but our regular watch will continue as before. Mind how you behave, churl.</span></p><h3 class="c12" id="h.9ovjesxr2pum"><span class="c13">Batahn&rsquo;s Technicks</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rabanastran (woman speaking with red bangaa): The parade was wonderful, don&rsquo;t you think? Just hearing the Consul speak, you could tell he&rsquo;s a man of power and influence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rabanastran (woman in blue, red, and pink speaking with moogle): I hear you hunted down the Rogue Tomato and even made it over to the clan hall. Coming along fast, kid.</span></p><h3 class="c12" id="h.u8ho4sc12sky"><span class="c13">The Sandsea</span></h3><p class="c0"><span>Gatsly: I&rsquo;m at my wit&rsquo;s end. If that shipment doesn&rsquo;t get through&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ll do. There has to be a hunter out there who&rsquo;ll do it</span><span class="c2 c19">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rabanastran (man sitting at table with woman): I saw you lookin&rsquo; at the notice board a while back. How did your hunt go? Well, I&rsquo;m glad to hear it! You started your next hunt yet? Let me know how it turns out!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Barkeep (woman in white standing by notice board): Never hurts to keep a close eye on the notice board. At worst, you can look over your current hunts, and at best, you may find a new one!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tavernmaster: How are things with you, Vaan? With all the food and drink orders for the fete, I can&rsquo;t complain, heh heh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Tomaj: Ah, Vaan! Defeated that Rogue Tomato, did you? I was worried you might not be ready just yet, but you did a fine job of it! Here. Your bounty for completing the hunt.</span></p><p class="c0 c24"><span class="c8">[Red &amp; Rotten in the Desert: 300 gil, x2 Potion, x1 Teleport Stone]</span></p><p class="c0 c24"><span class="c2">Oh, I hear you stopped by the clan hall. You&rsquo;re one shrewd customer. I&rsquo;m sure you heard all manner of things from the other hunters, but just take your time to ease into it and you&rsquo;ll do fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Rabanastran (black bangaa at bar with Tomaj): &lsquo;Course I didn&rsquo;t watch the parade.
