They kick me out of here, I&rsquo;ve no place to go.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Refugee (woman in blue dress talking with family): We cannot rely on the Kiltias to provide everything for us.

You are safe here.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Refugee (man in brown pants speaking with seeq and other man): They say the Gran Kiltias Anastasis can silence a king, or even an emperor, with a single withering glare. What I want to know is, why does he hide up here on this mountain? He should be down there, stopping those warmongers.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Refugee (man in gray pants at end of food line): At home, I chased rats in the gutters - for food, not for sport.

Don&rsquo;t worry, no need to jump the queue here. There&rsquo;s food enough for all.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Refugee (man in darker brown pants, first in food line): We are refugees from the Republic of Landis, fallen to the Empire long ago&hellip; before you were born, son.

Now, the fires of war rage outside, and we are close to overflowing.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Kiltias (woman at head of line): There&rsquo;s enough for all.

There&rsquo;s more every day. I&rsquo;m thinking to leave this place. The more people come, the less space there is for all.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Kiltias (woman standing to right in stone archway): Ah, a pilgrim. The temple grounds are ahead.

The Kiltias tend to refugees beside the road by which you came.</span></p><p class="c5"><span>Archadian Wayfarer: Can&rsquo;t fly in jagd so I came by ship, but the view from here was worth the long journey. I&rsquo;m no believer, but this place </span><span class="c21">is </span><span class="c9">impressive.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Kiltias (one of two listening to nu mou acolyte): Every day we welcome more refugees seeking the protection of the Kiltias, and our capacity to feed and shelter them grows ever more strained.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Acolyte (talking to a man and a woman Kiltias from edge of path): We cannot feed the refugees indefinitely, but must give them the means to feed themselves. If only one could magick foodstuffs&hellip;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Kiltias (man standing at side of path): The building ahead is the main temple. Within you shall find the Hall of the Light where His Grace Anastasis presides.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Kiltias (woman walking back and forth across path): You have the look of one who knows many technicks. But did you know that some technicks alter their range with different weapons? For instance, were you to use Souleater upon a winged foe, a sword would not avail you, yet a bow would serve in good stead. A good grasp of the situation is essential to prevailing in combat.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Acolyte (nu mou talking to two Kiltias in middle of path): The islands floating in the sky are said to be the remains of a great sky continent, shattered and fallen long ago. Even now, they bleed power, robbing airships of their buoyancy.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Kiltias (woman at right, at top of steps): Ah, a pilgrim. Continue on to reach the Hall of the Light, where presides His Grace the Gran Kiltias Anastasis.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Acolyte (nu mou preaching from atop a crate): My sleep oft troubled of late. I pray &lsquo;tis merely the nerves of an old man. Light guide your path. Faram.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Kiltias (woman in four-person group listening to nu mou acolyte): The old and wise nu mou elders teach us Kiltias. Simply speaking with them is a revelation.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Kiltias (woman talking to man Kiltias at edge): We Kiltias live on the gifts of believers. In the past, Nabradia and Dalmasca, too, gave generously, but those days are no more.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Kiltias (woman in large group listening to nu mou acolyte): The elders are concerned about the future of our mountain. Are the ever-swelling waves of refugees a sign of more evil to come? Faram.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Kiltias (woman walking around area to the left stairs to Hall of Light): The refugee&rsquo;s numbers are growing, while the pilgrims&rsquo; decrease. It is sad. I would think the faith vital in times such as these.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Kiltias (woman standing before stairs to Hall of Light): I ask that you remain quiet while in the Hall of the Light. His Grace is a dreamsage, and must have silence. Do not disturb his meditation.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Relj: Alone&hellip; Leave me alone. The hearts of humes are weak. I dare not grow close to them, lest mine grow weak as well.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Kiltias (woman talking to Relj): Alone&hellip;? Relj, do not say such things!</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Wyrm Philosopher: I came to the Paramina Rift hoping to study a rare strain of wyrm known as the vyraal. Sadly, I&rsquo;ve been most disappointed. If not the Rift, where might it be?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Acolyte (nu mou looking out over edge): Mt. Bur-Omisace is protected by the holy power of His Grace the Gran Kiltias. Once, long ago, a great wyrm, filled with avarice, sought to steal the riches of our mountain, but His Grace drove it off to Paramina.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Kiltias (woman on right, in middle of stairs to Hall of Light): Up the steps you&rsquo;ll find the Hall of the Light, where presides His Grace, Anastasis.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Acolyte (nu mou at top of stairs to Hall of Light): Ah, you are in Lord Larsa&rsquo;s party, yes? The Gran Kiltias awaits within. You shall find him through these doors.</span></p><h3 class="c5 c12" id="h.ajp3ixsml4xw"><span class="c17">Hall of the Light</span></h3><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Acolyte (nu mou to the left): His Grace Anastasis awaits ahead.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c9">Acolyte (nu mou on the right): His Grace the Gran Kiltias is a dreamsage.

You speak much of dreams. But in the real world, war is upon us.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c27 c30 c26">Ashe: Gran Kiltias, I was told my coming here would prevent this war.

I have not come all this way to be asked to reconsider!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">Al-Cid: A word from you and the Resistance would stop cold&hellip; and Rozarria&rsquo;s pretext for joining the war&hellip; scattered, off to the four winds. This was what we had hoped. Alas, circumstances change. A full two years have passed since your reported death. Were it to become known you were still alive&hellip; I fear it could only worsen our current situation.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c27 c30 c26">Ashe: Because I am powerless to help.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>Al-Cid: </span><span class="c21">[shaking his head]</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;Nay, in fact it has little to do with you. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">Larsa: Then what?
