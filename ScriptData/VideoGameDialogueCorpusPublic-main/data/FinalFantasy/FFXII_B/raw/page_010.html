I&rsquo;ve sailed many seas in my time, in search of the richest shoals, but I never heard tell of that place.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Quayhand (lady in pink, blue, and green): Reddas is a man true and just! This town was a den of villainy till he came along and cleaned it up.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Placid Pirate: Compared to how it was, this town&rsquo;s become nigh on </span><span class="c6">respectable, </span><span class="c1">thanks to Reddas.

He turns a cold eye on those who disturb the peace, that&rsquo;s why.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Contemplative Viera: Simply to gaze upon the sea&rsquo;s beauty cleanses the heart.

Perhaps I am not well&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Pirate Gossip: There&rsquo;s a strange fellow used to come here, though I haven&rsquo;t seen him lately. He was an odd one. Kept talking about defeating some wyrm out on Cerobi Steppe. But I heard all he does is yell at windmills.

They&rsquo;re not just lying around waiting to be found, you see&hellip; More oft than not, you won&rsquo;t even know where to start looking! That&rsquo;s when your fellow hunters come in handy. Most of the lot here&rsquo;re just looking for regular marks, but some of them might have heard reports of rare game on their travels. Ask around.</span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_z3y5dqu76tf5-0"><li class="c2 c3 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Tell me about the Hunt Club.</span></li></ul><p class="c2 c3"><span>The Hunt Club isn&rsquo;t just for sport, you know. When </span><span class="c19">rare game </span><span>is spotted on a rampage, we&rsquo;re the only thing between it and its next victim. While your average mark is posted after the damage has been done, we like to hunt down game </span><span class="c6">before </span><span>lives are lost. Thankless work, but it matters. Luckily for us, we&rsquo;ve found patrons in Archades with an eye for what we do, and the interest to support it. In fact, they wager on our hunts. The wager is simple: they pick a favorite hunter, and should he fell the most game, they win. You&rsquo;re a guest here, so they&rsquo;ll not wager on you. For you, we have a different contest in store. Now, when you hunt rare game, be sure to bring a trophy back to us. The question is, which of the bangaa brothers three will you give it? That&rsquo;s </span><span class="c6">our </span><span>little wager. Give the bangaa of your choice some trophies, and you&rsquo;ll be duly rewarded. Well put some things in the </span><span class="c19">Outfitters </span><span class="c1">for you. You follow? The more rare game you fell, and the more trophies you bring back, the more goodies you&rsquo;ll find at the Outfitters. Ah, I suppose I should tell you, we&rsquo;ve worked out a system to avoid getting too much of one thing in the Outfitters. See, we split things up&hellip; Atak is in charge of stocking weapons, Blok is in charge of armor and the like, and Stok handles everything else. Think well before turning in your trophies: what&rsquo;s available at the Outfitters depends on how many you bring in, and who you give them to.</span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_z3y5dqu76tf5-0"><li class="c2 c3 c15 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">No, thanks.</span></li></ul><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Shifty-eyed Man/Outfitters: Hrrm? What are you looking at? Ah, so the Huntmaster&rsquo;s given you the nod, has he? Well, anyone that&rsquo;s right by him is right by me. Listen good, and I&rsquo;ll explain how the Outfitters works. When you bring trophies back for the bangaa brothers here, it pleases their patrons. The patrons send cash, doubtless a portion of their winnings from wagering, and the Huntmaster uses that to bring in goods to sell here. But, not everyone may buy. Only those to whom the Huntmaster has given permission. See, this here&rsquo;s an exclusive shop. Hunt Club only.

Let&rsquo;s see, I can go through Nalbina Fortress, or take the ferry in the Estersand across the Nebra&hellip; Then again, I could also cross into the Estersand from the Westersand and then cut north. Which is the most scenic route, do you think?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rabanastran (man in green and blue talking to bangaa): You ever heard of Zertinan Caverns? It&rsquo;s a huge maze of tunnels connecting a number of different places near and far. I suppose you could even use the caverns as a shortcut, but the creatures within are rumored to be a frightful sort.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rabanastran (seeq browsing shelves): With the power the Dynast-King once held, even the Empire would be no match for Dalmasca. Of course, then there wouldn&rsquo;t be anything to keep Dalmasca from becoming the next Archadia, would there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rabanastran (woman in tan, pink, and green): I saw Old Dalan in the shop the other day talking about something or other with Migelo.

You know I would never try to stop you from doing something you&rsquo;d set your mind to, but do be careful, m&rsquo;boy. You do what you think is right.

Lately the bad outnumber the good by about nine to one, I&rsquo;m afraid. How about you, Vaan?

Considering the state of the place, I find it hard to believe.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Barkeep (woman on balcony): When Vayne returned to Archades, I was worried the Imperials would come back to the Sandsea, but so far, so good.

It may be best to wait and see how the winds blow before deciding. There may be more profit in selling to Rozarria, if you get my meaning.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Merchant (blindfolded tan bangaa): For a merchant, war spells opportunity.

Maybe I&rsquo;m not cut out for this business after all!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Traveler: I worry about what is to come.

Can&rsquo;t imagine how he must feel.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Impoverished Man: Seems Marquis Ondore is finally on the move. Had I known what he was planning, I&rsquo;d have given my money to him, rather than see the Empire take it. If he really is leading a resistance, maybe there&rsquo;s still hope we might someday be free of these Archadians.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Deadbeat: I don&rsquo;t feel like doin&rsquo; anything.

And where does that leave honest Dalmascans such as ourselves, eh? That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; on now.

Well, not that concerned, to tell the truth.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Geomancer Yugelu: A great power lies sleeping deep within the Henne Mines. Yet&hellip; as you are now, you lack the strength to master such a thing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Warrior Guromu: Our War-chief speaks little and smiles less, but he is a kind person. He is stubborn, yes, but all in the village know of his prowess.Yet, to watch him now, it is sadness. He is in pain, unable to forget a past mistake.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">War-chief Supinelu: There are many in the village who think me not fit to be War-chief. Of course, this is so. I am not like my brother before me, who was skilled in the ways of leading warriors. Yet&hellip; the Catoblepas I shall slay! It is my duty to the village.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Garif Elder: That cockatrice&hellip; Why do I feel I have seen it somewhere before?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Asdalu: I have heard that the nomads of Giza herd cockatrices much as we herd nannas. I wonder&hellip; do they eat them? I wonder&hellip; do they taste like chicken?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Garif Warrior: Geomancer Yugelu once told me that, in an ancient tongue, &ldquo;Zertinan&rdquo; means &ldquo;the underworld.&rdquo; I believe this name most fitting, for the Catoblepas and this new creature of strange powers seen there are truly hellish.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Garif Herder (to the right): You&hellip; can speak with the cockatrice? How amazing! Why did you not say this sooner?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Garif Herder (on far left): A cockatrice has wandered into our village. From its manner, I do not think it is wild.

Once you have completed Shurry&rsquo;s portion of this side quest and the cockatrice has gone, some of the villagers will revert to the following normal dialogue.]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Garif Herder (in front of hut by nanna pen): I knew the War-chief in his childhood, and I know him well now. When his elder brother, Kadalu, became War-Chief, he strove to become strong. Yet, after what the Catoblepas did&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry, it is a personal matter. Please forget it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Garif Herder (next to nanna pen): The other day, as I was milking one of the nanna in my enclosure, a nanna nearby bleated noisily. Oh, how startled I was! Nanna bleat only rarely, you see. And&hellip; we have a saying, that when the nanna bleats, evil will come.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Garif Herder (standing with other garif herder, in darker brown and metallic): Of late, our nannas are very restless. I fear it is a sign of something bad to come.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Asdalu: There is to be a war among the humes? At our gathering, so did the Great-Chief and the High-chief say. I fear that it may be true&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Garif Warrior (watching brawl on riverbank): Many garif warriors dream of the day when they shall face and defeat the Catoblepas. The War-chief is one such who dreams&hellip; Yet he dreams of folly, for he would face the creature on his own! Folly!</span></p><h3 class="c12" id="h.r94noomzioz9"><span class="c9">The Elderknoll</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">High-chief Zayalu: The garif have ever walked in history&rsquo;s shadow. Soon, even the humes will forget us, and we will remain only in legend. No, do not pity us, for this is how it should be.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Great-Chief Uball-Ka: In our village, time passes slowly. If you should tire on your journey, come and rest here. The Land will renew you, body and spirit. The burden you carry, it is heavier than most. Rest when you can.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Low-chief Sugumu: There is a creature wandering about the Zertinan Caverns that is surely to be posted as a mark&hellip; if it is indeed not already being hunted.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Garif Youth: You have traveled to many places, I hear. Have you seen snow? It is like silk to the eye, yet cold to the touch, is it not? I have heard that snow falls in the forest to the southeast of our village, but the elders warn against going there. They say this forest is a place of twisting paths that addle the senses.

Strength I may have lacked&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Lulucce: There was a commotion not long ago. Something fell from one of the trees. I get dizzy just thinking about it, kupo. I saw the wood-warders helping what looked to me like a cockatrice. Yes, definitely a cockatrice, kupo.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Tetran: Looking for something, kupo? </span><span class="c6">[shop menu] </span><span class="c1">It feels as though time stands still here, but when I go into town to restock my wares&hellip; how much has happened while I&rsquo;ve been away, kupo!

As countless spirits and uncountable visions before, the viera will fade to eldritch shadow, an echo of the Wood&rsquo;s voice on the wind.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Wood-warder (at bottom of steps): Visitors are not welcome in this place. Leave the Wood. Your way shall not be barred.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Wood-dweller (viera with shoulder-length hair sitting at center): You persist in visiting us. I did not think our welcome so&hellip; inviting. What do you think to find here? Or do you think not at all? Is it this sluggish wit that gives you humes such resilience? Intriguing&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Wood-dweller (long-haired viera with hand to wall, looking up at trees): Our paths are of our own choosing. Should two paths diverge, we might look back upon the time they were one, but never can they be untrod.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Wood-dweller (viera with bob looking at water lilies in pond): At what do I look? I would know this answer myself. Water is like the soul: ever-changing, constant only in its inconstancy. It flows, and freezes. It joins the air, and rains down upon the Wood.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nera: The Green Word, the laws of our village, a future filled with ruin&hellip; if we dwell on such weighty matters, we are like to collapse under the burden. There is no end that is not also a beginning. The sun will rise and fall as it always has&hellip; this is enough for me.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Wood-dweller (long-haired viera walking around): The wooden screens about the village interest you? If our village is attacked, we welcome our guests with arrows from behind those screens. It is a grave matter, never to be spoken of idly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Wood-warder (walking path in front of the warders&rsquo; den): The Green Word before all other things must we protect. In this we cannot look to others for aid.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kjrs: Yes? What is it? We discuss our sentinel of the Wood. I do not share Rael&rsquo;s tolerance for your interruptions. If your errand concerns not me, speak with me not.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rael: There are those who blame Jote for the deeds of her sisters. As elder, she must always defend the village. Until now, diligently she has. But she is not alone. We wood-warders stand at her side. Together we defend the Wood.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rena: Betrayal begins with but a thought of the world beyond the Wood. This is why we fear its call. What found Mjrn in that beyond? Please, visit us no more. For Mjrn&rsquo;s sake, if no other.</span></p><h3 class="c12" id="h.jqd8ci3888ce"><span class="c9">Fane of the Path</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Wood-dweller (speaking with another viera, sitting at the healers&rsquo; den): The reagents we gather in the Wood &mdash; plant seeds and roots, tree sap, animal eggs, feathers &mdash; all are stored in the house behind me. The Wood is the world to us, and the world the Wood. As we are part of the Wood, so are we part of the world. In this is there balance, and bliss.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Alja: Would you know more of the Wood? The life that burgeons in Her must be shown the proper respect. Beauty seldom comes without danger. To one who walks in ignorance, the Wood can seem dark, Her life promising naught but death.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Wood-dweller (long-haired viera): When will you learn your trespass here is not welcome? Do not think all Ivalice yours to wander as you please.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Wood-dweller (short-haired viera walking behind healers&rsquo; den): Do you still not see? There is nothing here for you. Here we live out </span><span class="c6">our </span><span class="c1">time. Your time and ours are not meant to cross. So has it ever been, and so shall it ever be.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Wood-dweller (short-haired viera standing near Jote): Always must Jote remain with the village, her thoughts on us and the Wood. She is our leader, our guide. Some think her too severe, yet the path the viera walk is long. Missteps early on, however slight, can lead us far astray.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hala: We choose this hidden place, secluded from the world beyond, to live as we have always lived. This is what it is to be viera. If you understand our ways even a little, you will not set foot again within our village.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jote: Seed is carried furthest on rough winds.
