They can also make you a better warrior. Take the Remedy Lore licenses, for instance. Each one of those you get lets you use a remedy to cure more and more ailments. Not bad, eh?

Good journey to you, bhadra.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bhujerban (man in turban and green &amp; brown shorts leaning against wall): You bear little love for the Empire? Then we have something in common. Thanks to the Empire, my home, Nabradia, is no more. Yes, that&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;m Nabradian. For two years I&rsquo;ve lived here, waiting&hellip; but for what?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Archadian Wayfarer: &hellip;I hate to admit this, but I fear I&rsquo;m lost. Ridiculous! First I get lost in Rabanastre, now in Bhujerba! It&rsquo;s poor urban planning, I tell you!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">City Parijanah: Traveler! May I be of assistance? If you are to go to the Lhusu Mines, I suggest you head east from here, passing through Miners&rsquo; End on your way. There are many shops along the way, should you need anything. Good journey to you, bhadra.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bhujerban (woman in white leaning against wall): Have you been to the Khus Skygrounds? They are to the west of here. The Lhusu Mines? They are to the east. Go through Miners&rsquo; End.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bhujerban Sainikah: The parijanah guides you see around town are working for the state to make sure all visitors to Bhujerba enjoy their time among us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Street Kid: Did you see the soldiers? There were so many!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">City Parijanah: I am a parijanah. I am here to assist. If you make for the Lhusu Mines, go down this hill and through Miners&rsquo; End.

Welcome to the best armory in Bhujerba. Should you be venturing beyond the city walls, or into the mines, stop here first!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Lhusu Miner (man in turban and blue shorts browsing): The mines were open from today, but now a party from the Empire&rsquo;s here for an inspection, work has stopped again. Unbelievable! I come here all the way from Nalbina to make some gil, and this happens! I gotta find something else to do&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Lhusu Parivir (blue seeq): Not every ailment is made alike, my friend. In fact, some there are made exactly opposite! Take the magick &ldquo;slow,&rdquo; for instance. Know someone slow? Slap &ldquo;haste&rdquo; on them and away it goes! Why, even the most pernicious afflictions sometimes have the simplest solutions!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Lhusu Miner (man in turban and brown shorts checking out sword): Perhaps it is that magicite itself draws raksas to it. Many foul creatures there are in the mines of late. We must protect ourselves, bhadra.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bhujerban (woman standing next to man in chair): Today the mines are closed, so I need not make lunch for my man, you see. It is not a bad thing, to have days like this every now and then.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Lhusu Parivir (black bangaa in line at counter): The quickest way to victory? Know your enemy&rsquo;s weakness! And how do you find a weakness? Use Libra!

This is the best weaponry Bhujerba has to offer! Always there is a queue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Shop Clerk: Welcome! Welcome!

Flans, for instance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bhujerban Sainikah: Raksas roam the Lhusu Mines, hunting the unwary. To protect themselves against these creatures of all description, the miners must be armed, you see. The mining of magicite is of great importance to Bhujerba. It behooves us all to see that the miners are working safely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bhujerban (woman in white, yellow, and green browsing on upper level): Haa&hellip; I wonder if there is a weapon that I, too, might use?

Hungry, I came here to find that now it sells magicks, not food. Haa&hellip; but they used to serve the most delicious stews, bhadra&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bhujerban Guru: Marquis Ondore keeps a wary distance from the Empire, bhadra.

Welcome to Bhujerba. I am a parijanah, a guide to our fair city. If you would go to the Lhusu Mines, head down this slope, and north along Miners&rsquo; End. Know the mines are closed now. There is no entry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Miners&rsquo; Ender (man in turban and green &amp; brown shorts leaning against wall): Have I seen you in Miners&rsquo; End before? I thought not. Welcome, bhadra. Perhaps you are here to enjoy the flavor of old Bhujerba?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bhujerban Guru: Ah&hellip; I seen some sour-lookin&rsquo; bangaa about. Eh? Bangaa&hellip; and a hume girl? Sorry, bhadra. Seen nothin&rsquo; of the sort.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Shop Clerk: Welcome to Clio&rsquo;s Technicks, kupo!

Yes, we have little space for such things. That is why we must sell our Stones and import what foodstuffs we need.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Miners&rsquo; Ender (woman in pink and tan sitting on ledge at bottom of hill): I&rsquo;ve just finished work in Rabanastre&hellip; What a terrible place it is. The Empire is everywhere. I felt quite suffocated, yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Miner&rsquo;s Ender (man sitting on ledge speaking to woman): The soldiers, it seems they are looking for someone. I hope they find whoever it is, and leave us soon. Can they not see we are in love?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Miners&rsquo; Ender (woman in pink, blue, and green walking and talking to various people): You may see many Imperials about, bhadra, but it is not always so. Bhujerbans are a proud, independent people. Not cows like the Dalmascans.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Lhusu Miner (orange seeq sitting against wall): Hanta! One of the Imperials, in his haste he has stepped upon my foot! Ayi&hellip; Next I see him, he shall pay. Bhorta swears it!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Miners&rsquo; Ender (moogle with green pom-pom sitting on crate): The Imperials seem quite agitated today, kupo! How am I to take my nap with all this toing and froing?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Miners&rsquo; Ender Kid: How I wanted to play on the Kaff Terrace, but the Imperials, they block our way! It is not fair! Back to Archades with you, murkha Imperials!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">City Parijanah: Lost your way? Allow a parijanah to assist you! Ah, you go to the Lhusu Mines, perhaps? This road, it leads to Kaff Terrace. If you go straight up this slope, you will reach a junction. There, go to the east and you will find the road to the mines.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Lhusu Miner (black bangaa looking up at moogle on ledge): Moogle! Your days are numbered, do you hear me!? Come down here at once! Adhuna! Now!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Miners&rsquo; Ender (woman in blue, yellow, and pink speaking with group): No, of course I do not like the Imperials on our streets, but it is better than resisting them and ending up like Dalmasca, no? Independence is not won for free, you see.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Lhusu Parivir: Nnh? This here&rsquo;s Miners&rsquo; End, bhadra. Lhusu, that&rsquo;s north&hellip; But it&rsquo;s closed, say the criers. How&rsquo;s a seeq to earn an honest day&rsquo;s wage?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Miners&rsquo; Ender (moogle in yellow with orange pom-pom): Oh, so many hills in this town, kupo! I suppose that&rsquo;s what the travelers come here to see. But me, I cannot see for the sweat in my eyes, kupo!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Lhusu Miner (man in dark shorts sitting on rail outside gambit shop): Good day, bhadra. Have you been to the mines? I am a miner, you see. We who dig the Stones must be ready for raksas attacks, to fight them as one. That is why we frequent Bashketi&rsquo;s Gambits!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bashketi&rsquo;s Gambits (sign): Gambits having been deemed nonessential to Mining Operations, we operate without Charter, though we believe Efficiency is quintessential!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Miners&rsquo; Ender (woman in pink and tan with headscarf, leaning against archway): Ah, you seem new to this place, yes? You do know where you are? We are on Dorstonis, one of the purvama, the floating lands. Many are the visitors from all parts of Ivalice who come to see the wonder that is Bhujerba. That is why the city employs guides, the parijanah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bhujerban Sainikah: Haa? The Lhusu Mines? They are closed, bhadra. You are a traveler, yes? I do not think they will let you in, with the Imperial inspections.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">City Parijanah: Svagatam, traveler. How may I assist you? Should you go east from this junction, you will reach the mines. West, Cloudborne Row.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Lhusu Miner (man in green &amp; brown shorts sitting on ledge, left side of junction): Today the mines are closed and so I think to go to the Cloudborne for a drink, yes?

Gambits meant to aid one&rsquo;s companions will do them no good should they wander too far afield. This is when you should tell them what to do directly, you see. It is vital for you to use both gambits, and old-fashioned orders, well!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bashketi: Look upon my wares and know perfection, bhadra! Yes, it is I, Bashketi.

Of course, not today, for the mines are closed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Lhusu Miner (man with back against wall): You carry potions and elixirs, do you not? Haa&hellip; Their value cannot be overestimated! Better than magicks, many times.

Welcome to Cloudborne Row. Turn the corner, and you will find the Cloudborne, purveyor of fine Bhujerban Madhu!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cloudborne Resident (man in turban and green &amp; brown shorts): This street is not a place for travelers, bhadra. It does not do to wander the back alleys. You might become lost. You might find trouble.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cloudborne Resident (tan bangaa in green vest): How is it that Judges walk our streets as though they belonged here, their soldiers with them? The Marquis is a fair-weather friend to his people!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cloudborne Resident (tan seeq with turquoise horn): I saw the Marquis Ondore and a Judge pass by not moments ago. The Marquis&hellip; any lesser man would quail before a Judge, but he stood proud.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cloudborne Kid: My sister works at the Cloudborne, though she is no bar-wench, but the taverner. Very busy, very strict. Best not to trouble her, no.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bhujerban Sainikah: Back here, bhadra, it is not lost travelers, but lost drinkers whom we must care for. Take the spirits, but care the spirits do not take you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cloudborne Resident (woman in white leaning against wall): I have just heard that Captain Ronsenburg of Dalmasca was spotted in Lhusu Square! Drivel from the mouths of drunkards!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Archadian Wayfarer: P-Pardon&hellip; Please, stop shouting like that&hellip; Urgh, my head, it pounds! Bhujerban Madhu is as sweet as her maids, and as strong as her Stones!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cloudborne Resident (moogle in gold with orange pom-pom pacing in front of tavern): My first ever visit to the Cloudborne. It&rsquo;s been a long time coming. I&rsquo;m going in, kupo! With a friend. Once we can find the door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cloudborne Patron (light blue seeq talking to woman sitting on crate): Yer not from around here, are you? Well, this here&rsquo;s the Cloudborne, favored watering-hole of miner and traveler alike. Those guides you see around, the parijanah, they hold meetings here, too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cloudborne Patron (man standing beside collapsed bangaa outside tavern): Every time we drink, this! I tell him, count the cups, count the cups, and does he count them? Yes! If only he would stop counting&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">City Parijanah: Svagatam, traveler! If it is shopping you desire, do see Travica Way. Why, Targe&rsquo;s Arms is just up the stairs here, you see. Here&hellip; this is more of an alley, to tell the truth. Most come here only for drinking&hellip; that would be at the tavern down the slope. Good journey!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bhujerban Guru: Haa&hellip; I have recently met the leader of the parijanah guides, Havharo. Very mysterious, very handsome! He frequents the Cloudborne, you know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cloudborne Resident (tang bangaa talking to blue seeq): The other day, a man in his cups was shouting of the Marquis&rsquo;s &ldquo;involvement&rdquo; with some anti-Imperial resistance. Now&hellip; he is gone. The lesson: show the fool&rsquo;s coin, pay the fool&rsquo;s price.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Lhusu Miner: They say the Lhusu Mines are silent today. People talk of important men from the Empire come to see the mines. The ones in armor, perhaps?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bhujerban Sainikah: I have heard that the quality of our Stones is dropping, but this is because the Empire buys all the best. I trust the Empire not, with their laboratories and their experiments. What are they up to?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Archadian Wayfarer: I came to see the source of the power that keeps this land of Dorstonis afloat, yet with the Lhusu Mines closed&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">City Parijanah: Svagatam, traveler! Welcome to Bhujerba! Wish you to see the estate of his Excellency the Marquis? Then go you down Travica Way. You can see the estate at the north end of the Way from most parts of Bhujerba. It is quite impressive, and a useful landmark, if you are lost. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">City Parijanah: Svagatam, traveler! You have been to Travica Way? It is right up these steps. And Mait&rsquo;s Magicks is at its end. I recommend stopping there, oh yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cloudborne Resident (woman talking to red bangaa and blue seeq): Have the inspectors from the Empire left? I mistrust the Empire. After what I saw in Nalbina, who wouldn&rsquo;t?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cloudborne Resident (moogle in gold with orange pom-pom sitting on crates): This building here? Why, this is the Staras residence, kupo. House Staras has long controlled the Lhusu Mines. They&rsquo;re nobility!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cloudborne Resident (man in dark pants sitting on crate next to moogle): I hear an Imperial fleet is to put in to port quite soon. Each fleet arrival is a great opportunity for our merchants to sell, you see.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cloudborne Resident (light blue seeq): Careful on these streets. Gets dangerous &lsquo;round here at night. Bunch o&rsquo; drunks gave me a right beatin&rsquo; just the other night. Think they were part of this resistance group I been hearing about.</span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.wdtujdmtxlj7"><span class="c5">The Cloudborne</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3">City Parijanah (talking to patrons at table): Pardon. As you can see, I am occupied. If you have a question, you may ask another parijanah, please. This said, all the parijanah here are off duty, I should hope.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Shop Clerk (woman in green and pink top walking around): Hanta&hellip; I am so busy! It is because of that lazy Magu! He is that seeq in his cups and out of his wits by the barrel there. He is paid for this!?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Shop Clerk (moogle with green pom-pom): Care for some Bhujerban Madhu? It&rsquo;s a local favorite, kupo! Oh, wait, you&rsquo;re far too young, kupo. Come back later! Much later!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cloudborne Patron (man leaning against wall talking to woman sitting on barrel): If you seek posted bills for hunting marks, you can find them on the board at the far end of the tavern, bhadra. Would you make a name for yourself? Then you&rsquo;d do well to check there early, so another does not hunt all the marks before you!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cloudborne Patron (woman sitting at table with two others): The Marquis supporting a resistance against the Empire? It is best not to speak of such nonsense in a place like this, bhadra. You never know who might be listening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cloudborne Patron (man in orange-brown shorts sitting at table with woman): When the Imperials were here, it was hard to relax and enjoy a cup. Now, I can drink to my heart&rsquo;s content. As it so happens, my heart&rsquo;s quite thirsty.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cloudborne Patron (light blue seeq at bar): Have you tasted the spirit known as Bhujerban Madhu? It is a local favorite! Only reluctantly do we allow outsiders to drink it. Especially not boys! Come back when you are a man grown, and we shall see then.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Magu: Harrum? Melisa call for me? Kah!? A resist-er-rance? Mmrrrph. (snort) What&rsquo;s that? Is it good eatin&rsquo;?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cloudborne Patron (moogle with yellow pom-pom): Oh, I&rsquo;m here to meet a friend, kupo! But&hellip; he&rsquo;s nowhere to be seen. I&rsquo;m thirsty!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Melisa: Welcome to the Cloudborne, traveler, where all Bhujerba comes to forget the worries of the day. I&rsquo;m the taverner, Melisa, at your service. Sit down, rest your feet, boy&hellip; Kah? A resistance? Crazy! All right, who gave this boy here a sip of the madhu?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">City Parijanah (in blue jacket, talking to Melisa): A resistance against the Empire, bhadra? Surely, there are many in our city who dislike the Empire, yet the Marquis has ever remained neutral. Were such a group to form, why, they would all be arrested with due haste, I think.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Cloudborne Patron (man standing at bar talking to woman): There are many who believe that Bhujerba might defy the Empire with economic superiority, bhadra, but I disagree. Were the Imperials to block off our trade routes, the city would starve. It is an undeniable fact.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">City Parijanah (talking to red bangaa): Begging your pardon, bhadra, but I am off duty, you see. Kah? An organization? His Excellency the Marquis Ondore against the Empire? Many big words, bhadra. Can you say this again, ten times, fast?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">City Parijanah (leaning against bar with arms crossed): If it is directions which you seek, bhadra, ask another parijanah. I am off duty. Kah? A resistance against the Empire? Please, I am in no mood for such japery today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Timorous Bangaa: Hold it, friend. Hrrm? A &ldquo;Resistance&rdquo;&hellip;? Bah! Nothing of the sort here, traveler. (Why do I always get the odd ones&hellip;)</span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.4wueuuooz7rh"><span class="c5">The Staras Residence</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Niray: Good day, bhadra. No&hellip; no, it is not a good day, for my son has run away from home! Should you see him, please, tell him to come back. My son&rsquo;s name is Yrlon, you see. I&rsquo;m afraid I was too harsh on him for breaking my prized bottle of Bhujerban Madhu&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Kait: I know where my brother has gone, bhadra&hellip; But I cannot tell you. He would be very cross.</span></p><h3 class="c9" id="h.1e9bxr1jw9er"><span class="c5">Aerodrome</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c3">City Parijanah: Svagatam, traveler. We parijanah are official guides to the city. Outside the aerodrome you will find Travica Way, Bhujerba&rsquo;s main street.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Traveler: Contrary to popular belief in these parts, not everyone in Archades has his own airship! No, only the rich and privileged have those.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bhujerban Sainikah: Svagatam, traveler. Welcome to Bhujerba, island of peace in the raging storm that is Ivalice, thanks to his Excellency, the Marquis.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bhujerban (man sitting on rail, talking to another man and an Imperial): From Rabanastre, are you, bhadra? I hear the Imperials are quite bold there. Not so here in Bhujerba, where they know their place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Bhujerban (moogle with yellow pom-pom sitting by window): I was shopping and missed my flight for Rabanastre! It&rsquo;s times like these when I think it&rsquo;d be awfully nifty to be rich and have my own airship, kupo&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Traveler: Finally, the skyferry&rsquo;s starting up again&hellip; Of course my airship&rsquo;s still delayed! Tsk. No respect for class, these peasants!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Street Kid (sitting on suitcases next to his parents): We go on a family trip to Rabanastre, bhadra! Is it true that, under the Imperial occupation, you cannot buy food or clothing there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Street Kid (near window): When I grow older, bhadra, I will be an airship pilot! A moogle, he is teaching me now, you see. He has just left on the airship for Rabanastre!</span></p><h4 class="c2" id="h.plu0z271bte0"><span class="c18">Vaan&rsquo;s Clamor</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Various lines from Vaan, when &ldquo;testifying&rdquo;&hellip;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c26">I&rsquo;m Captain Basch fon Ronsenburg of Dalmasca!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c26">Don&rsquo;t listen to Ondore&rsquo;s lies!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c26">Basch lives!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c26">I&rsquo;m THE Basch fon Ronsenburg!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c26">I&rsquo;m Captain Basch!</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10">Whenever you testify to an ordinary citizen, they will then be labeled as &ldquo;Informed Citydweller&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Informed Wayfarer&rdquo;, &ldquo;Informed Shopkeep&rdquo;, etc. when you talk to them.
