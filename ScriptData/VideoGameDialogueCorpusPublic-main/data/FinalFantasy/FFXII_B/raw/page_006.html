Already he busies himself unraveling Lord Vayne&rsquo;s tangled skein. Lord Larsa has found his role to play, and pursues it with some enthusiasm. </span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Gramis: Ah, yes&hellip; And who would set him at such tasks?</span></p><p class="c5"><span>Senator 3: What matter? Lord Vayne himself once saw </span><span class="c6">his </span><span class="c3">elder brothers brought to like justice, did he not?

Some are saying it was the Imperial fleet sinkin&rsquo; from the sky!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rabanastran (kid in blue with his father in north part): Did you hear? Did you hear? My friend down in Lowtown saw a GHOST!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Lovestruck Man: Urrr&hellip; I can&rsquo;t get her out of my head&hellip; Who? That viera, that&rsquo;s who.

He&rsquo;s probably still over at Westgate trying to figure out what to do next.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rabanastran (kid on blue and green on south side of fountain): What?

It&rsquo;s me, Jinn, from Giza Plains. Remember? It&rsquo;s the Rains now, so we&rsquo;ve all left the village. Not a soul left there. I thought I saw some people coming up from Ozmone Plain when we was leavin&rsquo;&hellip; I wonder if they know the village is empty?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Bright-eyed Boy: I heard there were some sick people at the village in the Estersand. They can&rsquo;t even leave their homes.

Yeah, they leave, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rabanastran (man in brown pants by southgate): It&rsquo;s the Rains down in Giza again. How can I tell?

Off havin&rsquo; fun without the rest of us?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rabanastran (man in brown pants by westgate): There&rsquo;s a great sandstorm in the northern part of the Westersand. The winds are so strong you can&rsquo;t even stand, much less walk. You can scarcely see for all the sand, but you can hear. There&rsquo;s a terrible cry riding on that wind. Best to keep well away, if you ask me.</span></p><h3 class="c10" id="h.whgepeldrsep"><span class="c9">Eastgate</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Hapless Merchant: Have you been to the village in the Estersand? It&rsquo;s on the banks of the River Nebra, should you fancy a visit. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rabanastran (woman by chocobo pen): On the far side of the Estersand you&rsquo;ll find Nalbina Fortress. That&rsquo;s where His Majesty was assassinated&hellip; Sometimes I wonder what things would be like now, if only he were still alive. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rabanastran (woman in white talking to two kids): Before the war, this place bustled with travelers and merchants going about their business.

It&rsquo;s not as though it&rsquo;s never been explored, but who can say what strange things you might find there?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Adventurer: Just takes one look at the sky to tell if it&rsquo;s the Rains or the Dry down in Giza. Never hurts to take a look afore settin&rsquo; out. The lay of the land, even the very beasts change from the Rains to the Dry, y&rsquo;know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Imperial (standing a short distance away from his partner with the chocobo): The Rains came sooner than expected. Trudging sodden through empty villages and bogs&hellip; a glorious posting this has turned out to be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Imperial (standing beside chocobo): I&rsquo;ve naught to say to you, churl. It&rsquo;s bad enough that I&rsquo;m soaked to the skin&hellip; No one bothered telling us it&rsquo;d be the Rains, and don&rsquo;t get me started about that village! This is why I hate these bloody provinces&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rabanastran (man speaking to woman and seeq): Why do you suppose they raise cockatrices down in Giza?

I use the aerodrome as a marker. If I see that, I know I&rsquo;m at Westgate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rimzat: Hha! I&rsquo;ve been waiting for some time. You see, I am in need of assistance. Please, hear my words. I have been sent from Archadia to study the sandstorms of the Dalmasca Westersand, but the storms&rsquo; violence makes such study&hellip; impossible. There is a place in the desert, at the end of a long trail that winds through the north. Mayhap you know it. That is the site of my study. But before the wrath of such a storm, I can do nothing.

I have made no progress on my own. I would like you to start by gathering information within Rabanastre. My own inquiries yielded little. There is one man who knows more than he will say. He sits atop the fountain in the plaza. He does not care for the Empire, so he will tell me nothing. Perhaps you will have better luck.

I&rsquo;m gathering the parts I need to make repairs as quickly as I can, but it may take some time, kupo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rabanastran (man in blue, red, and green): You see that group of people by the window? They&rsquo;re from Archadia. They never left after the parade&hellip; Maybe they&rsquo;re thinking of staying. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Traveler: The return ship to Archades still hasn&rsquo;t come.

But who will protect us from the Empire if they change their minds?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Frustrated Man: Door back here hasn&rsquo;t worked since&hellip; since I don&rsquo;t know when. But those blasted Imperials won&rsquo;t give the word to have it fixed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Somber Woman: When the children born since the war are older, and my daughter sees other kids with parents, I wonder if she&rsquo;ll feel more comfortable with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Guileful Boy: You know why they sent Vayne back to Archadia? I bet it&rsquo;s because he wasn&rsquo;t treatin&rsquo; us mean enough. He ain&rsquo;t done nothin&rsquo; mean, really.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Guileless Girl: Sometimes I play down in the alley what leads up to Southgate. Yep. But I don&rsquo;t go up there. And I definitely don&rsquo;t go down to Giza. Nope.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Awestruck Girl: See that man squattin&rsquo; down talkin&rsquo; over there? They say he used to be a sky pirate! It&rsquo;s kinda exciting, havin&rsquo; someone mysterious around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Samal: People think being a sky pirate is all riches and adventure, but the reality is far different. Your life is always at risk, you never know peace. You are free, I suppose. But it comes at a steep price. Your fate, succeed or fail, is entirely up to you. So what does it mean to be free? That&rsquo;s the real question. Running to escape your troubles won&rsquo;t make you free. It never can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Well-spoken Girl: I wonder if this is how I&rsquo;m going to grow up, here in the dark passages of Lowtown. Rather depressing, don&rsquo;t you think? Sometimes I just want to run far, far away from it all&hellip; but that&rsquo;s not easy when you&rsquo;re just a child.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Friendly Boy: I don&rsquo;t feel so good.

Word has a way of travelin&rsquo; fast, but then, words ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; but wind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rabanastran (blue seeq sitting beside child): Them sluice gates down in the Garamsythe Waterway got some special device what controls &lsquo;em. Drain the water off, you can walk the waterway into deep places you couldn&rsquo;t reach otherwise. Couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to work it all, m&rsquo;self.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dalmascan Patriot: The village in the Estersand is one of the few places we can go to escape the burdens of the city. I find the peace and quiet refreshing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Cynical Boy: Plenty of people out there are happy, so long as there isn&rsquo;t a war. Well, if this is peace, I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s so great about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Kytes: Hey, Vaan. Haven&rsquo;t seen you around much lately. Workin&rsquo; on somethin&rsquo; big? Can&rsquo;t wait to hear more about it! You don&rsquo;t have to worry about me and the others. I&rsquo;ll watch after everybody.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Fussbudget: No fair&hellip; She said she had a dream she saw Princess Ashe. How come I never have dreams about the Princess?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rabanastran (sitting next to black bangaa outside Storehouse 5): I hear there&rsquo;s a stair down to the sewers through Migelo&rsquo;s storehouse, but you shouldn&rsquo;t poke around down there. It&rsquo;s dangerous, boy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Northon: Watchin&rsquo; Filo and her friends play at pirates reminds me of when I was a kid. We&rsquo;d run around pretendin&rsquo; we were real sky pirates &ndash; had a secret hideout and everything. Things were so much simpler back then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Watchful Seeq: I can&rsquo;t let my eyes off this poor fellow for one minute. Little while ago he got himself all worked up over his son, went runnin&rsquo; off into a wall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Impoverished Man: Everything I owned was confiscated after the war. Now I&rsquo;m forced to live out my miserable days here. Suffering here because of the Empire, I feel I&rsquo;m more of a Dalmascan than I ever was before. Ironic, don&rsquo;t you think?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Rabanastran (woman in white): Look, over there by the door. Do you not see Milha crouched there? What might have happened? That is the house where the man from Nabudis had lived, but it has lain empty for some time now. I have recently heard tales of a&hellip; a ghost sighted not far from here.

You got your South Sprawl in the&hellip; where&rsquo;s the South Sprawl? Just let me lie here and think&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Angry Woman: Don&rsquo;t you find it strange that the Empire lets us lead such normal lives? With the exception of living in this dungeon, of course. Are they waiting to use us in some sinister plot? Are we tools of the Empire? Are we their hostages? Just who do they think they are?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Well-spoken Boy: I&rsquo;ve heard a rumor that the Imperial fleet was destroyed, but it&rsquo;s hard to be happy about it. Think of all the poor people who must&rsquo;ve died.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Vexed Father: I&rsquo;ve told her a thousand times not to play outside, that it&rsquo;s dangerous, but she goes anyway&hellip; To be honest, some of the places she&rsquo;s been, I&rsquo;m a little surprised. She made it to the Salikawood the other day. Said there were moogles there. Heh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Furious Bangaa: Grrah! That son of a cockatrice! Who!? Vayne, that&rsquo;s who! Know of anyone else gone runnin&rsquo; back to Archades with his tail between his legs? You know why he&rsquo;s left, don&rsquo;t you? Too scared to stay and face us, that&rsquo;s why!

They save the easy jobs for the humes. Me? I get sent off to do the heavy lifting. Those Imperials think the rest of us are to be used as tools, nothing more. Nice, eh?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Merchant: Nestled as it is on the border of Nabradia and Dalmasca, Nalbina was always bustling with trade between the two.

If I stick with you, I think I will.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Ashe: I wish I knew.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c23 c14">Vaan: I&rsquo;ll find &lsquo;em.</span></p><h4 class="c16 c24" id="h.2o0ajp7x26v"><span>To Bur-Omisace</span></h4><p class="c16"><span class="c15 c6">[The scene fades out, and then in on Ashe, Larsa, Penelo, and Vaan standing on the bridge near the exit to Ozmone Plain the next day.]</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1">Ashe: I will accompany you to Mt. Bur-Omisace.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Larsa: I had hoped you&rsquo;d say yes. I am glad.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1">Ashe: My heart is not set. I still have questions. I hope to find answers along the way.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Larsa: I had other reason to invite you. There is someone I&rsquo;d like you to meet waiting on Bur-Omisace.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c1">Ashe: Who is that?</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Larsa: An enemy, and an ally also.

Once we&rsquo;re in jagd, we need not fear pursuit by their airships.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c38 c14">Balthier: Don&rsquo;t get your hopes up. You remember the </span><span class="c38 c14 c6">Leviathan </span><span class="c13">sailed straight over the Jagd Yensa, right up to Raithwall&rsquo;s tomb. Skystone that works even in jagd. You know nethicite&rsquo;s behind it. Little wonder they&rsquo;re so keen on the stuff.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c14 c34">Basch: And what is it you&rsquo;re after, Balthier? You&rsquo;re a welcome hand, and a great aid, but why?</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c13">Balthier: Worried I&rsquo;m out to steal the nethicite, eh? Can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m unaccustomed to people doubting my intentions. Nothing could be further from my mind. Shall I swear by your sword or some such?</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c34 c14">Basch: Apologies. But I needed to know where you stand. Her Majesty depends on you. And you seem to have an interest in the Stone.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c13">Balthier: I&rsquo;m only here to see how the story unfolds.
