People post bills here on the notice board when they have a monster they need taken care of. Headhunters track people, right? Well, hunters track monsters. The monster you&rsquo;re hunting is called your mark. Here&rsquo;s the bill I posted for the Rogue Tomato, the mark I&rsquo;ve petitioned to have hunted.

Let him know you&rsquo;re going on the hunt. So, take this Rogue Tomato bill, for example. I posted it, so I&rsquo;m the petitioner. You have to come talk to me. Let&rsquo;s call that step &ldquo;done,&rdquo; okay? Once your agreement&rsquo;s in place, the petitioner will tell you how to find the mark. Then you hunt it, report back, and claim the bounty.

Know why? You don&rsquo;t have the </span><span class="c44 c40">license </span><span class="c51 c52 c40 c56">for it. Think of licenses as mile posts, marking your progress as your combat skills improve. Swords, bows, black magicks, white magicks&hellip; none of it does you a lick of good until you have the license to use it. Same goes for that armlet. Tomaj, how can I equip this great treasure you&rsquo;ve bestowed on me, you ask? Easy: learn by doing. Let&rsquo;s give it a try.</span></p><p class="c7 c42"><span class="c51 c52 c38 c40">[License Board Tutorial]</span></p><p class="c7 c42"><span class="c25 c26">Tomaj: You can acquire a new license anytime you like from the Party Menu. First, decide whose licenses you want to examine. I don&rsquo;t see anyone else here, so it looks like that means you, Vaan.</span></p><p class="c7 c42"><span class="c40">This is the license board. The license board shows which licenses you already have, as well as some new ones waiting to be obtained. Licenses you&rsquo;ve acquired are marked with a </span><span class="c44 c40">star</span><span class="c51 c52 c40 c56">.</span></p><p class="c7 c42"><span class="c51 c52 c40 c56">Looks like right now you can equip Leather Clothing, Leather Caps, and Mythril Swords, and you have the technick to Steal from your foes. Heh, still a little wet behind the ears. We all have to start somewhere, though. The more licenses you have, the more equipment you&rsquo;ll be able to use, and the more abilities you&rsquo;ll have to choose from.</span></p><p class="c7 c42"><span class="c25 c26">But a license alone isn&rsquo;t enough. Did you notice how Mythril Blade was darkened? That&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t have one in your inventory. You&rsquo;ll need to buy magicks from a magick shop, and arms from a smithy before you&rsquo;ll be able to put those licenses to use. It doesn&rsquo;t matter which you get first, magicks and equipment, or the license to use them, so long as you have both. You can use any magicks and technicks in your possession as soon as you acquire the necessary license. But you&rsquo;ll have to equip weapons and armor before they&rsquo;ll do you any good. Got it?</span></p><p class="c7 c42"><span class="c51 c52 c40 c56">All right, let&rsquo;s take a look at that number in the top left. These are your license points. You spend these points to acquire new licenses. You can acquire any license that&rsquo;s next to one you already have, but only if you have enough license points.</span></p><p class="c7 c42"><span class="c40">Ah, this should do! Why don&rsquo;t you try obtaining this license now? Select the license and press X. Then you&rsquo;ll have the </span><span class="c44 c40">Accessories 1</span><span class="c51 c52 c40 c56">&nbsp;license.</span></p><p class="c7 c42"><span class="c51 c52 c40 c56">Now you shouldn&rsquo;t have any trouble equipping that orrachea armlet I gave you. Just don&rsquo;t forget to equip it, okay? You probably noticed already, but when you obtained that license, several new ones appeared on the board.</span></p><p class="c7 c42"><span class="c51 c52 c40 c56">You don&rsquo;t have enough license points to obtain any more now, but take down a few monsters and you&rsquo;ll have the points before you know it. Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry to spend all your points, though. Think about which licenses you really need, or you might regret it later. Oh, let me show you one thing while I&rsquo;m at it. Go ahead and press &#9633;.</span></p><p class="c7 c42"><span class="c25 c26">That list shows all of the actions you can take during battle. It can definitely come in handy. Well, if you can remember all that, you shouldn&rsquo;t have any trouble taking down a mark or two on your own.</span></p><p class="c7 c42"><span class="c38 c40">[</span><span class="c32">Licenses </span><span class="c51 c52 c38 c40">has been added to the Party Menu.]</span></p><p class="c7 c42"><span class="c51 c52 c40 c56">I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;re ready to hunt that mark for me.

Successfully hunting marks will earn you a small bounty. See that notice board over on the wall? That&rsquo;s where you can go to see what bills have been posted. It all starts there. But just looking at the bill isn&rsquo;t enough. You have to go talk to the petitioner and accept the hunt before setting out. The bill will always tell you where to find the petitioner. Once you&rsquo;ve accepted the hunt, you&rsquo;re ready to track down the mark using the information given to you by the petitioner. If you&rsquo;re able to defeat the mark, report back to the petitioner. That completes the hunt, and you should receive your bounty. Simple, right? The best way to learn is by doing. Hunt a few marks on your own and you&rsquo;ll have it down in no time.</span></p><p class="c2 c42"><span class="c3">Ah, Vaan. I meant to tell you: this isn&rsquo;t the only notice board you&rsquo;ll find. Most cities &ndash; even some villages &ndash; have their own board.

But know this &ndash; I harbor no idle hopes of frustrating that hatred, nor shall I ask your fealty. That is the due of your fallen king, and rightly so. King Raminas loved his people. Strove to bring you peace. His was a rule worthy of your devotion. Even now, he remains among you, protecting you. His ardor for the peace and weal of Dalmasca falters not. I would ask only that you do your king honor. &nbsp;Together, let us embrace this peace His Majesty would surely desire. Two years now divide us from war&rsquo;s bitter end, yet still its shadow looms over all, stifling the infant peace, a pall only you may cast off. Achieve but this one thing, and your hatred of me, and the Empire, will grieve me not! I will stand fast! I will endure your hatred! Suffer your slings and arrows! I will defend Dalmasca! Here I will pay my debts, I swear it now. Though King Raminas and Lady Ashe be gone, they stand ever at the side of their people. &nbsp;In honoring peace, you do honor to their memory, and to Dalmasca. What I ask, I ask plain. My hopes now rest with you.</span></p><p class="c41 c24"><span class="c51 c52 c14">[The audience, somewhat stunned and reluctant, breaks into applause as Vayne bows.]</span></p><h4 class="c1 c9" id="h.349ezzi09ip6"><span class="c22">Subjugation, and Scheming</span></h4><p class="c1"><span class="c18">Imperial: Is Rabanastre to your liking, my lord?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c18">Vayne: It is magnificent!
