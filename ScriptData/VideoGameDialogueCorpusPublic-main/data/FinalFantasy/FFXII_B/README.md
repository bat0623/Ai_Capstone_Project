# Final Fantasy XII

## Source

The source claims to be "A comprehensive transcript of the entirety of the Playstation 2 game Final Fantasy XII, including everything from cutscenes to NPC dialogue and item interactions."

## Gender coding

According to the fan wiki ('Bangaa'):  
>"The Bangaa have both male and females, but it is impossible to tell the two apart, until they actually start talking." 

Most voiced bangaa in game are male (Rinok is the obvious exception, and she has hair/fur, unlike her brothers). I suspect players will tend to read them as male unless signposted otherwise, but if unvoiced (and if there aren't other clues, like pronouns), I've coded neutral. E.g. Adept Adventurer, Reluctant Adventurer, No. 982, No. 395, Amal, Batahn, Luccio, Va'Kansa. The "Hapless Merchant" is described by his friend, the "Desert Merchant", using male pronouns. "Atak", "Blok" and "Stok" are referred to as the Bangaa Brothers, so I've coded as male. 

According to the fan wiki ('Seeq'), only female seeq cover their upper half, so NPC gender identification is by appearance if there aren't other clues. (So "Adventurer" at the Westgate covers their top half, and I've coded as 'female'; likewise for 'Shifty Seeq'. "Seasoned Adventurer" I've coded as male, because they look to have just a necklace). "Stranded merchant" has the same clothes as "Seasoned Adventurer", and they refer to themselves as a 'fellow'. Likewise (necklace but not ear coverings) for "Jolly Seeq", "Laughing Seeq" and "Watchful Seeq" in Lowtown. I think "Malloud" is female, as they have the fabric covering over their ears like other female seeqs, but I couldn't get a look at their upper half to be sure - coded as female. 

From the fan wiki ("Moogles"): 
>"As with the other non-human races, moogles are non-dimorphic; gender can mainly be assumed by the clothing they wear." 

Gurdy is the most talked about (and according to many fans online, only) female moogle in game; the other distinct moogles are her brothers. Other moogle characters use a standard (seemingly male) model. The exception is Pilika, who uses a male character model and outfit, but female pronouns (and is referred to as she in script and the wiki). Technically "The Moogles Eight" are eight moogles, but I've coded them as a single character - they have few lines and it's not immediately obvious (unvoiced dialogue) if they're singing in turn or unison. 

There aren't gender details re the nu mou in the fan wiki. However all the nu mou use the same character model, and of those characters with specific names, all are male. As a result, I've coded all the nu mou male. I think all the 'acolyte' titled kiltias are nu mou, so have coded accordingly. 

We only see Garif men in-game, as the women live separately (the opposite of the viera - we only see female viera in-game).

"Imperial" doesn't denote a single character but rather a type - as best I can tell they are all male voiced and use the same character model (except in Archades where they aren't wearing helmets but still use a male character model). Where a distinctive character appears (e.g. where an imperial in a given location repeatedly discusses the same content in the same way), I've given them an alias. Still - like storm troopers - there will be cases where it's not clear if two imperials are the same person (or indeed how many there are altogether).

Most prisoners in Nalbina Dungeons are male, but No. 474 is difficult to determine because they're sitting crouched over, so coded as neutral. Same for No. 124. 

"Demented merchant" is difficult to discern the gender of, especially given the character models for older people in the game (usually pronouns are more helpful). I've coded as neutral. 

I had always assumed the Bhujerban Parijanah were female when playing on PS2, but they appear to be read as male to other players (judging by walkthroughs etc. that mention them as 'guys' etc.) and several discuss their wives/women to whom they will be married (given the tendency towards heteronormativity in FF games, this suggests they're men). I've coded as male - looking at the remastered version this seems clearer. 

"Lamont" is an in-game alias for "Larsa". They are the same person, so for our purposes I've added an alias ("Lamont": "Larsa"). Likewise for "Amalia" and "Ashe". 
Near the beginning of the game, Gabranth is imitating Basch for a time. I have added an alias for those lines. 

Where prompts aren't dialogue but instead system messages - e.g. the description of a corpse, the floors a lift will visit - I've given an 'ACTION' alias. 

Senators - 2:37:42 the first time. Senator 1 has long white beard, Dumbledore style. Senator 2, also grey/white hair, but shorter cropped beard. 

"Informed Kid", "Informed Shopkeep" etc. apply to different people (and thus different genders). Unless there's a decisive gender (e.g. 'Informed Moogle' because all the relevant NPCs are male), then I've coded as neutral. 

The following characters I couldn't find in let's play videos (or other evidence for), so have coded neutral: 
"Kiltias (farthest from Golmore exit)", 
"Kiltias (nearest to Golmore exit)", 
"Refugee",
"Refugee (standing with the Kiltia)", 
"Traveler (Observation Parlour)"
"Traveler (Sky Saloon)"

Note that this source is missing some sidequest and end-game dialogue. See for instance https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0EWDsu4LH8 conversation from about 25min. Doesn't cover the full plot (e.g. Pharos onwards) or all the sidequests. What is here is very comprehensive though, and covers the majority of the game.

"Outfitters" is described in the text as "Shifty-eyed Man".

"Storekeeper" is described as having a wife.
