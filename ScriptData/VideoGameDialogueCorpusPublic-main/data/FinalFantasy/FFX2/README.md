# Final Fantasy X-2

## Gender coding

Pukara/Pukutak were coded male. I've changed this to female; in the Japanese version they have a female voice actor (unlike the other musicians) and in English it sounds like a woman's voice. 

I've changed 'Fayth' from neutral to male, as this specifically denotes the Fayth of Bahamut, who is a young boy. 

I've also changed 'Hypello' to male, because all the Hypello (other than Darling) have the same male voice actor. Darling is signposted as a female hypello (she's the Smurfette), so the implication seems to be that the others are male. 

I've split out the guado lines as they belong to two different guado. Both have hair associated with male guado in FFX, so I've coded accordingly. 

The "Citizen" lines are voiced by a generic man. Although the last one appears to be said by Vuroja, the captain of the Kilika Beasts, so I've split it out. 

"????" had been incorrectly attributed to Isaaru - it is Isaaru in some instances, but not all of them. I've fixed that. 

"Ex-Prophet" is the same person as "Prophet" (just going by a new name at one stage of the game) so I've added an alias. 

"Goon" is a male enemy type (with "Fem-Goon" the female equivalent). Coded male. 
As best I can tell, as in FFX, all the guards are male. 

"All the gullwings" is coded as Buddy, Brother, Rikku and Paine (they are replying to Yuna). See https://youtu.be/X8fkdO9RqMc?t=1495


Youth League/Yevon members:

"Youth League Members 1, 2 and 3" are all male: see https://lparchive.org/Final-Fantasy-X-2/Update%2020/5-Ep10_005.jpg

Just before Yuna's "concert" song:
-  Youth League Member 1 is female
-  New Yevon Member 1 is male
-  New Yevon Member 2 is male
-  Youth League Member 2 is male

See https://youtu.be/0d7NDNZ1FFk?t=108

"Youth League Members" are seen here:

One is the same member that is seen in the concert clip above.
Two appear to be male, and one appears to be female.
