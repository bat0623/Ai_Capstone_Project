## Gender coding

"Yeuls" is several duplicates of Yeul. The different "Yeul" incarnations are tricky. They all are named 'Yeul', but they are sometimes distinct, and they flash between each other. I've indicated this with aliases where possible. 

"\"The evil savior will die at the hands of the Shadow Hunter.\"" are written glyphs, not dialogue, so I've coded as ACTION. 

Moogles are non-dimorphic; gender is indicated by outfit and voice. I've made best guesses. 

"Bandits" are two male bandits talking over each other. I've coded as "male". 

"God" is an actor in a play, playing Bhunivelze. They're distinct (not aliases). 

As in other FF games, there are generic soldier NPCs that are indistinguishable in location/voicing - here they are "Sentry" characters. However, there are few enough of them that some can be differentiated by location/appearance.
