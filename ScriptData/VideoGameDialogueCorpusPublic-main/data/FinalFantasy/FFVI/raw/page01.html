Final Fantasy Script

Written by: NoWorries

Version 1.0, Final (most likely)

Originally submitted September 15 of 2014


This is the entirity of the script for Final Fantasy VI. Anything left out
will be noted. Also random townsfolk talking will likely not be included.
There may also be some of my own personal flair thrown in just for fun.
If you really feel the need to contact me, you may at tskisoccer@yahoo.com
But in all likelihood this is going to be the only version of it save a
discovery of a massive typo or something. I also include some music titles
that follow the path of the game for your listening pleasure.

Also, I really don't care where this ends up (I'm posting it to Gamefaqs) but
the other approves sites (you know who you are) can certainly post it there
as well. If you want it on yours feel free to email me. Ninety percent of the
text that follows is from the game; it would just be nice to receive credit
for typing this all up, formatting it, and making it available for you, the
reader, to enjoy, or reference, or to not look at. Either way. Enjoy!

Opening: Omen

        Long ago, the War of the Magi
          reduced the world to a
        scorched wasteland, and magic
          simply ceased to exist.
		  
        1000 years have passed... Iron,
        gunpowder, and steam engines
        have been rediscovered, and
          high technology reigns...
		  
          But there are some who
         would enslave the world by
        reviving the dread destructive
           force known as &quot;magic.&quot;
		 
            Can it be that those
        in power are on the verge of
           repeating a senseless
             and deadly mistake?

		   
		
		
----------------------------------

ENTER
    Vicks, Wedge, and ????
	
	
VICKS: There's the town...

WEDGE: Hard to believe an Esper's been found intact there,
       1000 years after the War of the Magi...
	   
VICKS: Think it's still alive?

WEDGE: Probably... judging from the urgency of our orders.

VICKS: And this woman, this... sorcerer. Why's she here? I
       heard she fried 50 of our Magitek Armored soldiers
       in under 3 minutes.
	   
WEDGE: Note to worry. The Slave Crown on her head robs her
       of all conscious thought. She'll follow orders.
	   
WEDGE: We'll approach from the east. Move out!!


----------------------------------

ENTER
    The soldiers enter the tower of Narshe
	

WEDGE: Let's put her on point. No sense taking any risks. Forward!

    They attempt to explore to the right of the INN
	
GUARD: Machine-riding, self-important swine! Take this!

    A single Lobo attacks and falls. The Guard retreats.
	
    They proceed further into Narshe
	
GUARD: Imperial Magitek Armor? Not even Narshe's safe anymore!

GUARD: Narshe's freedom depends on us!

    Once they pass by the ITEM SHOP, the trap is sprung
	
GUARD: We've got 'em trapped, now!

    They approach some stairs as they near the mines
	
GUARD: We must defend the mines!

    They approach an open mine shaft
	
WEDGE: According to our source, the frozen Esper was
       found in a new mine shaft. Maybe this one...
	   
    They approach a gated entrance
	
VICKS: I'll handle this. Stand back!

GUARD: We won't hand over the Esper!! Whelk! Get them!

    They engage the snail-monster Whelk
	
VICKS: Hold it! Think back to our briefing...

WEDGE: What about it?!

VICKS: Do you recall hearing about a monster that eats lightning...

WEDGE: ...and stores the energy in its shell!

VICKS: Right. So whatever you do, don't attack the shell!

WEDGE: Alright already!

    They approach the frozen Esper Tritoch (though we don't know that yet)
	
UNKNOWN: This is the frozen Esper...

    An eerie blue light envelops them into battle
	
WEDGE: Hey! What's the matter? Do you know something we don't...?

    The Esper flickers a few times as Terra approaches it
	
GIRL: ....

    The frozen creature began to emitting an eerie light...
	
WEDGE: Where's that light coming from?! Uwaaaaaaa!!!!

    Wedge dies
	
VICKS: Hey! Wedge... where are you? W... what's happening?!

    Vicks dies
	
GIRL: ... ... ...

    Some strange connection occurs followed by an explosion
	
	
----------------------------------

ENTER
    Arvis's House
	
	
GIRL: Where am I...?

OLD MAN: Whoa! And I only just removed the crown!

GIRL: ...head...hurts...

    Arvis walks over and reveals some crown
	
OLD MAN: Easy! This is a Slave Crown. The others had complete
         control over you while you were wearing it.
		 
GIRL: I can't remember a thing...

OLD MAN: Don't worry. It'll all come back to you... in time, that is.


        A mysterious young woman,
        controlled by the Empire, and
        born with the gift of magic...
		
		
GIRL: My name... is... Terra...

OLD MAN: Impressive! I've never heard of anyone recovering this fast..!

    From the outside, dogs and soldiers approach
	
SOLDIER: Open up! Give us back the girl and the Empire's Magitek Armor!!

SOLDIER: Open this door! We want that girl! She's an officer of the Empire!

TERRA: Empire...? Magitek Armor...?

OLD MAN: Look, I have to get you out of here! I don't have time to explain!

    Arvis runs over to his backdoor

OLD MAN: Over here!

OLD MAN: Make your way out through the mines! I'll keep these brutes occupied!
		 
    Alas, as Terra is over the bridge the guards spot her
	
YELLING: She's up there!

    Terra approaches a corner near a door in the mines
	
VOICE: Got her!


----------------------------------

ENTER
    Terra's flashback
	
	
KEFKA: My sweet little magic user...! Uweee, he, he! With this
       Slave Crown I'll practically OWN you!!
	   
    Terra attacks a solider amidst a burning village
	
KEFKA: Uwee, hee, hee! Good! Burn up everything!

    They're now outside Vector

GESTAHL: We stand on the brink of a major breakthrough! In the
         days to come, we'll witness a total revival of magic!
         It is our destiny, and ours alone, to take this mystic
         force and claim what is rightfully ours!

    Kefka, Leo, and Celes move forward and everyone begins saluting
	
GESTAHL: With our new-found power, nothing can stand in our way!

LOUD CHEERS: Hurrah!!! Long live Emperor Gestahl!!!

----------------------------------

ENTER
    Arvis's House
	
	
OLD MAN: Took you long enough! How goes the robbing and plundering trade?


        Treasure hunter and trail-worn
        traveler, searching the world
        over for relics of the past...
		
		
LOCKE: I PREFER the term treasure hunting!

OLD MAN: Ha! Semantic nonsense!

LOCKE: There's a HUGE difference!

LOCKE: Anyway, were you the one who sent for me?

OLD MAN: Yeah. There's a girl I'd like you to meet.

LOCKE: ..!? This better not have anything to do with that
       Magitek-riding, imperial...witch!!!
	   
OLD MAN: Imperial troops are pursuing her even as we speak.
         This town is no match for the Empire. Our independence
         can only be assured if we join forces with the Returners,
         an underground resistance movement. That girl wasn't
         responsible for her actions. We must get her to understand
         our dilemma!
		 
LOCKE: All right... I think we'd better help her...

OLD MAN: Agreed. Make your way first to Figaro, and talk to the king.

----------------------------------

ENTER
    Locke drops down and discovers Terra
	
	
GUARD: Now we gotcha!

LOCKE: Wonderful... There's a whole bunch of 'em...

    Kupo... several Moogles appear from behind Locke
	
LOCKE: Moogles...! Are you saying you want to help me?

Kupo!!!

Interesting aside here...

Locke's party contains KUPEK, KUPOP, and KUMAMA. KUPEK and KUMAMA both do more
damage in the front row than the back row and KUPOP has the FLAIL so it can
go in the back row REGARDLESS (though strictly speaking everyone should go
into the back row most likely)
Mog's party, contains KUPAN, KUTAN, and KUKU. KUKU is the worst Moogle ever
and unlike KUPAN and KUTAN, does half damage due to his blade whereas the
others have a FLAIL and a BOOMERANG. Mog, you should strip Mog but he's so
strong it doesn't really make much of a difference

In the all Moogle party, KAMOG is the only Moogle that can sit in the back
row and deal full damage, everyone else has &quot;crappy&quot; weapons. Anyways...

    Once the enemy has been dealt with
	
LOCKE: Thanks, Moogles! We're in your debt!

    Locke sprints a good distance before setting Terra down to fiddle
    around with a switch on the wall, causing it to open a hole
	
LOCKE: I think this switch'll

LOCKE: Eh? You back with us now!?

TERRA: You... saved me?

LOCKE: Save your thanks for the Moogles!

TERRA: Uhh... I can't remember anything... past or present...

LOCKE: You have amnesia?!

TERRA: A man said my memory would come back...

LOCKE: Give it time. You're safe with me! I give you my word!

TERRA: ???

LOCKE: I won't leave you until your memory returns!!
       By the way, this secret entrance might be useful
       some day. Don't forget about it! (hint hint)
	   
    And now no more sprinting. Sad day. You could go to the Classroom,
    but that text will not be recorded. Only main story line text will
    be recorded  (sidequest too, but no random townsfolk)
	
----------------------------------

ENTER
    Figaro Castle
	
	
SENTRY: WAIT! Hey! Oh it's you. Proceed.

    They approach the Throne Room and Locke goes to speak with Edgar
	
MAN: You mean, THIS young woman...?!

    Edgar gives her the twice over
	
TERRA: Who do you think you are?

MAN: Oh... sorry! How rude of me to turn my back to a lady!


        The young king of Figaro Castle,
        ally to the Empire, and a
        master designer of machinery...
		
		
EDGAR: I am Edgar, King of Figaro.

LOCKE: Surprised someone like me knows a king?

    Edgar and Locke do some more quiet conversing
	
LOCKE: Talk to you later!

EDGAR: So... you're an Imperial soldier! No problem.
       Figaro and the Empire are allies! Please, relax
       while you're here. It's not in my blood to harm a lady.
	   
TERRA: Look, why are you helping me? Is it because of my... abilities?

EDGAR: I'll give you 3 reasons: First of all, your beauty has
       captivated me! Second... I'm dying to know if I'm your
       type... I guess your... abilities... would be a distant third.
	   
TERRA: ...? What's with you, anyway?

EDGAR: Guess my technique's getting a bit rusty...

TERRA: Hmm... I suppose a normal girl would have found him
       dashing. But I'm hardly... normal...
	   
    Terra walks a good distance to speak with MATRON
	
MATRON: Edgar has a twin brother. He was such a nice boy...

    Enter the flashback
	
YOUTH: Brother, what's wrong with father? What's
       all this talk of his successor?
	   
EDGAR: Are you blind? Look how thin his face has become!

YOUTH: ?...What is it?

    Edgar begins walking away
	
YOUTH: Brother!

    Edgar bows his head and leaves
	
YOUTH: Tears...?!


        Edgar's twin brother, who
        traded the throne for his
        own freedom...
		
		
    Return to present day
	
MATRON: Yes... His name is Sabin. Oh, he looked so like his father!
        When he ran away, he was a sweet little child. I wonder what
        he's like now?
		
    Terra returns to the Throne Room
	
EDGAR: Well? How do you like my castle?

    In runs a sentry
	
SENTRY: King Edgar! Someone from the Empire to see you!

EDGAR: Probably Kefka!

    Flash to the desert just outside Figaro
	
KEFKA: Phooey! Emperor Gestahl's stupid orders! Edgar you pinhead!
       Why do you have to live in the middle of nowhere? These
       recon jobs are the pits!
	   
    In his rage, Kefka looks down at his boots
	
KEFKA: Ahem... there's SAND on my boots!

    The scared soldiers oblige and wipe them off; Kefka laughs
	
SOLDIERS: Yes sir! All set, Sir!

KEFKA: Idiots!

    The party approachs the entrance
	
SENTRY: Sir Kefka!? What on earth do...

KEFKA: Outta my way!

    To the guard on the left
	
EDGAR: I thought we were allies! What are you doing in my domain?

    To the guard on the right
	
EDGAR: You've been busy down south! Looking for more cities to destroy?

TROOPER: That's for us to know!

    To Kefka
	
EDGAR: What brings Kefka, humble servant of Emperor Gestahl,
       into our lowly presence?
	   
KEFKA: A girl of no importance recently escaped from us. We
       heard she found refuge here...

EDGAR: Hmmm... this wouldn't have anything to do with this &quot;witch&quot;
       everyone's been whispering about, would it?
	   
KEFKA: Lies! She... merely stole something of minor value. Is she here?

EDGAR: That's a tough one! You see, there're more girls here than grains
       of sand out there. I can't keep track of 'em all!
	   
KEFKA: I'd hate to be you if we find out you're lying... Mwa, ha!

    He begins to leave
	
KEFKA: I truly hope nothing happens to your precious Figaro...!

    They leave and Edgar goes to Locke
	
LOCKE: I'd say that guy's missing a few buttons...

EDGAR: ... Where's Terra?

    Just on the other side of that door
	
EDGAR: Take her to her room...

    To Terra:
	
EDGAR: I'd love to chat with you, but the Chancellor and I
       must plan our strategy. Sometimes I hate being a
       king! If you'll excuse me.
	   
    He departs and Locke says to follow him, but you can go faster
	
    Once they are in her room which is strangely public
	
LOCKE: Don't you worry 'bout a thing! I'll...

TERRA: You're Locke, right? Edgar told me about you. Is it
       true you're a thief?
	   
LOCKE: That's TREASURE HUNTER!
       On the surface, Edgar pretends to support the Empire.
       The truth is, he's collaborating with the Returners,
       an organization opposed to the Empire. I am his contact
       with that group... The old man you met in Narshe is one of us.
	   
TERRA: Empire... but I'm a soldier of the Empire...!

LOCKE: That's not true! They were using you! Things are different now.

TERRA: I don't understand... what should I do?

LOCKE: I can't tell you what to do. You don't have to decide
       right now. You'll soon find your way...
	   
TERRA: But how will I know which way is right...

    Edgar wakes up and is afraid...
	
EDGAR: ...? What the?

    And the castle is burning. Great
	
EDGAR: What's happening?

SOLDIER: It's the Empire! It's Kefka!

EDGAR: What are you doing?

    You can actually just go up but if you want to hear them...
	
KEFKA: Bring me the girl. Now!

EDGAR: I don't know what you're talking about!

KEFKA: Then... welcome to my barbecue! Uwa ha ha ha!

    To the sentry outside the door
	
EDGAR: Get ready...!

SOLDIER: Yes, sir!

KEFKA: Changed your mind...?

EDGAR: I guess I have no choice...

    And he jumps off the castle onto a Chocobo. That must hurt
	
EDGAR: Or maybe I do!

KEFKA: Ackk! Shameful that a king should flee, leaving his people behind!
       How utterly delightful!
	   
EDGAR: Jump!

EDGAR: OK! Dive now!!!

LOCKE: Yahoooo!

    Surely because he crunched his testacles
	
SOLDIER: Figaro Submerge mode engaged!

CHANCELLOR: No one can touch the people of Figaro!

KEFKA: GO!! GET THEM!

    Apparently it is much more violent in the Japanese version...
	
    Anyways, you can use magic here and get some text. It's long
    and boring and not at all important to the plot so feel free to
    cast something. I choose not to because well, it's long and
    boring and is unimportant to the plot. Anyways
	
EDGAR: Bravo Figaro!

KEFKA: Son of a submariner! They'll pay for this...

    Another editted phrase
	
LOCKE: This is great!

TERRA: Was that a bad person? I... I'm scared...

EDGAR: Terra, there's someone I'd like you to meet..!

LOCKE: We're members of the Returners.

EDGAR: Our mentor, Banon, would certainly like to meet you.
       &quot;Magic&quot; is going to be the key to winning this way.
	   
TERRA: &quot;Magic&quot;...

EDGAR: Terra has magical powers. That Esper seemed to... react
       to her. Can there be some connection?
	   
TERRA: I haven't the foggiest! It just seems natural to me
       that I have the use of this power...

EDGAR: But no HUMAN is born with the powers you seem to have, and...

    Whoops that was rude
	
EDGAR: I apologize.

TERRA: What should I do...?

EDGAR: I'm sure the Empire is going to come after you...
       If they get their hands on you again, the world's finished...
       Terra, you want to understand your own powers right?
       Then I think we need to consult with Banon.
	   
TERRA: ...

LOCKE: Please...

EDGAR: OK! To the south there's a cave that leads to South Figaro.

    They approach the cave entrance, which looks like every other cave...
	
SOLDIER: King Edgar! Where are you headed?

EDGAR: Through the cave, and eastward to South Figaro. Return to the castle,
       and tell the others we're safe.
	   
SOLDIER: Yes, Sir! Take care!

----------------------------------

ENTER
    The town of South Figaro
	
	
    There's actually nothing to do here. However, talk to Shadow
    for arguably better dialogue now instead of later
	
...

LOCKE: At the very least you could give me a response...

EDGAR: Stand back! He seems vaguely familiar... Wait a minute...!


        He owes allegiance to no one,
        and will do anything for money.
        He comes and goes like the wind...
		
		
EDGAR: That's Shadow! He'd slit his mama's throat for a nickel!

LOCKE: Better steer clear of him, I guess.

----------------------------------

ENTER
    Sabin's House
	
	
EDGAR: Hm... What's that smell...?

FLOWERS
    Flowers, his favorite
STOVE
    And this... his favorite tea...
DISHES
    These dishes! They were his favorite!
	
EDGAR: Sabin... he was... here?!

    Talk to the man outside
	
EDGAR: What the... You know this guy?

MAN: Of course. He left a couple of days ago after he heard
     Master Duncan was slain. He headed into the mountains.
     I heard Duncan's son, Vargas, is missing as well.
     I have a bad feeling about this...

----------------------------------

ENTER
    MT. Koltz
	
	
VARGAS: Sabin sent you, right?

LOCKE: Who're YOU?

EDGAR: Sabin? Is he here?

LOCKE: You were shadowing us earlier, right?

VARGAS: Brilliant! And how unlucky it is that you have run into me!

    In the fight
	
VARGAS: Enough! Off with ya now!

VOICE: Give it up, Vargas!

VARGAS: Is that you, Sabin?!

SABIN: Vargas, why'd you do it? How could you
       do in your own father in like that?!
	   
VARGAS: Fool! He made the mistake of choosing you
        as his successor! He snubbed me, his only son!
		
SABIN: No! You were the one he chose!

VARGAS: You're a liar!

SABIN: Our Master wanted you to be his successor, not me.
       He appreciated your fine spirit...
	   
VARGAS: Enough of your lies! Now have a taste of my
        superior technique! Mortal Attack! Blizzard Fist!!
		
    The others are swept away
	
VARGAS: Ahhh, Sabin! The master taught you well!

SABIN: I guess there's no avoiding this!

VARGAS: Fate made us train together, and fate will send you to your doom!

    Sabin used Pummel! It was super effective!
	
VARGAS: W....what the...!? He... already taught you that?!

SABIN: If only you hadn't been in such a rush for power...

    Vargas dies
	
EDGAR: Sabin!!!

SABIN: Big brother?

LOCKE: The brothers are reunited!

TERRA: Younger... &quot;brother&quot;? At first glance I thought he
       was some bodybuilder who had strayed from his gym...
	   
SABIN: Bodybuilder? I'll take that as a compliment...
       Anyway brother, what are you doing here?
	   
EDGAR: We're on the way to the Sabil Mountains.

SABIN: To the Returner hideout no doubt?

SABIN: I've been watching from afar, hoping that the world
       might regain some sanity... at this rate, Figaro will
       be reduced to a puppet state.

EDGAR: Our time to strike back has arrived. The Empire's going
       to pay for what it has done...
	   
SABIN: Think a &quot;bear&quot; like me could help you in your fight?

EDGAR: You'd... join us? Sabin!!

SABIN: I think Duncan would rest easier if he knew his disciple
       played a part in bringing peace to the world.
	   
LOCKE: Let's get going!

----------------------------------

ENTER
    The Returner's Hideout
	
	
GUARD: King Edgar! Follow me please

EDGAR: Banon! We brought the girl with us.

BANON: Is she the girl who can talk to Espers...?!

TERRA: Espers...?

EDGAR: Seemed the Empire had complete control over her.

BANON: Carrier pigeons brought word that she wiped out 50
       of the Empire's best soldiers in a few minutes.
	   
TERRA: That's a lie!

LOCKE: Terra!

EDGAR: Banon! She doesn't remember ANYTHING!

BANON: Stay where you are!

    Banon begins walking around
	
BANON: Perhaps you've heard this story? Once, when people were
       pure and innocent, there was a box they were told never to
       open. But one man went and opened it anyway. He unleashed all
       the evils of the world: envy, greed, pride, violence, control...
       All that was left in the box was a single ray of light: Hope.
	   
TERRA: ...

BANON: We now confront those evils... And you are that last
       ray of light, our only hope...
	   
EDGAR: Banon!

BANON: I'm so tired... let me rest a while.

    So now Terra gets to walk around and talk to people
	
LOCKE: Someone important to me was jailed by the Empire.
       I've hated the Empire ever since...
(actually, Rachel more or less died but whatever)
       I joined the Returners when I realized the Empire
       was rotten to the core. I wanted to make a difference.
	   
TERRA: But... I have no significant &quot;other&quot; in my life...

LOCKE: That's not entirely true. Besides, I'm sure there
       are people who feel YOU'RE important to them! They
       are counting on you...
	   
SABIN: The only thing I can add is that you can trust my
       brother implicitly. He's always been fair with me.
       You can trust him, Terra... But don't you DARE
       tell him I said that!
	   
EDGAR: It's gonna be tought to talk you into helping us...
       If we push you too hard, we're no different than
       the Empire... So we want you to make up your own mind.
	   
    Which is half true. Since you can say no three times, but
    then the game gives you a giant middle finger and says
    &quot;Let's get this thing going already!&quot;
	
SOLDIER: Banon? He went outside a moment ago

BANON: Have you made a decision? Will you become our last ray of hope?

TERRA: Yes.

BANON: You will? Really!!

TERRA: But... I'm scared...

BANON: The person who possesses this relic need not fear harm.
       Please, Terra... I'd like you to take it with you.
	   
TERRA: What is this????

BANON: A lucky charm!

    Actually, it's a Gauntlet
	
BANON: I have a plan! Please get everyone together!

    Returners of the Square Table...
	
BANON: Right... We all know that the Empire is using Magitek
       power in battle. The point is, how has the Emperor created it?
	   
EDGAR: I had Locke look into the rumor that the Empire is forcing
       the world's finest scholars to study Espers.
	   
LOCKE: All the trouble in Narshe is over an Esper, too...

TERRA: You mean there's some connection between Espers and Magitek?

BANON: I can only recall one thing linking Espers with Magitek power...
	   
EDGAR: You don't mean...

BANON: Indeed! The ancient War of the Magi

CRIES OUT
  &quot;NO!&quot;
  &quot;It can't be!&quot;
  
LOCKE: My Grandma used to tell me stories about magical
       machines... Could they have been true?
	   
EDGAR: Could that ancient tragedy be playing out once again...

BANON: It's just speculation... But historical studies have
       provided a number of conflicting and frightening theories...
       According to one theory, humans and machines were imbued with
       powers drained from Espers...
	   
TERRA: That could explain Magitek power...

EDGAR: We can only fight Magitek enemies with Magitek weapons...

BANON: It's risky, but if we have Terra... speak with that Esper,
       it might just wake up...

EDGAR: I wonder if that's wise...?

BANON: Who can say? Regardless, we need Terra's help.

    Locke runs over to Terra

LOCKE: Terra...

TERRA: I'll do it!

SABIN: What nonsense! You sound as if you're enjoying this!

It is only now we realize that Sabin, Banon, and Edgar aren't sitting.
Oh and there's a knock

BANON: What? What's that noise?

    The fun police!
	
WOUNDED SOLDIER: Emergency! Sir Banon... S... South Figaro

BANON: What's going on? What happened?

WOUNDED SOLDIER: E... Empire took... Figaro... Coming... this way... unnnh

BANON: They've found us... We haven't a moment to lose!

EDGAR: Locke!

LOCKE: I know... &quot;Someone&quot; has to sneak into South Figaro and slow the
       Empire down right?
	   
EDGAR: This's right up your alley! Good luck!

LOCKE: Terra... please wait for me... and please...
       Don't let a lecherous young king, who shall remain
       nameless, near you!
	   
EDGAR: Locke!!!

SABIN: Big brother... Aren't you EVER going to grow up?

BANON: What're we going to do?

EDGAR: We'll escape down the Lete River, and make our way
       to Narshe. I want to see that Esper for myself...
	   
BANON: Right. There's a raft by the back entrance. It's a gamble,
       but we're fresh out of options...
	   
EDGAR: You're in danger here. Come with us to Narshe.
       You'll probably even gain some understanding
       of your own abilities...
	   
BANON: We've no time to dilly-dally. Let's make for Narshe!

    On the other hand...
	
BANON: Have you made a decision? Will you become our last ray of hope?

TERRA: No

BANON: I see...

BANON: Have you made a decision? Will you become our last ray of hope?

TERRA: No

BANON: I thought as much...

BANON: Have you made a decision? Will you become our last ray of hope?

TERRA: No

BANON: You're sure about this?

TERRA: Hope... How can anyone put their hope in me?

    Banon gets pushed backwards
	
BANON: What's going on? What happened?

BANON: Someone did a number on him...

    And then the dialogue is the same! Hooray! But then...
	
SOLDIER: I understand your unease. But even as we speak,
         innocent lives are being lost... Please. We need
         your abilities. This relic will keep you safe.
		 
    Well, why didn't they do that sooner! Genji Gloves is both
    superior and the dialogue is shorter this way

What? WHAT IS IT?

ULTROS: Uwee ee ee, Game Over! Don't tease the Octopus kids!

    Upon doing &quot;enough&quot; damage

ULTROS: That's all friends!

SABIN: I guess we thrashed it.

EDGAR: Don't bet on it... It's probably just hiding from us...

TERRA: Ewww!! Something's stuck to my leg!

EDGAR: Terra! Over here!

BANON: It's all right now.

SABIN: Watch out! I'm going to hit it with a Blitz!

EDGAR: No! Sabin!!

SABIN: Don't distract me brother!

EDGAR: He's always been a tad zealous...

TERRA: Sabin!

BANON: Don't worry about him!

EDGAR: Are you sure he's okay Banon?

BANON: You should know better than any of us! Any moment
       he'll flop right onto the raft!
	   
    There he goes; and wow what a glitchy screen if you let it sit a mom'
	
SABIN: What the?

BANON: ...

EDGAR: Seems a little too perky... Ha!

TERRA: Sabin!!

Sabin, who was swallowed by the raging waters...? And... how is Locke faring,
after having penetrated the Empire's defenses in South Figaro...

Is all going according to plan...?

Choose a scenario! Let's choose the group first!

Fleeing the Empire's troops, Banon, Edgar, and Terra ride the rapids
towards Narshe. But the going won't be easy... Especially when they put
Banon in the front. Like WTF

GUARD: Hey, lady... didn't you just bust in here wearing Magitek Armor?

BANON: Wait a sec!

GUARD: Get out of here! If you don't...

    Then I'll punt Banon about 8 people's worth of spaces
	
EDGAR: Hold on. I'm King Edgar of Figaro...

GUARD: Liar!!!

    I'll only punt you 7 spaces and not the girl
	
BANON: Aye yai yai...

EDGAR: That kind of attitude is deadly! He won't even listen!

TERRA: It's all my fault...

    And no reassurance? Damn Edgar where are you brotha?
	
    Head to the secret spot
	
TERRA: When Locke first helped me, he fiddled with something right
       around here.
	   
It actually was inside but whichever. Also, fiddled with something ha

EDGAR: Knowing him there's probably some secret switch in this rock wall...

    And we ignore the security thing and the Moogles. Not important

Suddenly he has a name, and isn't Old Man

BANON: Arvis! What's happening here in Narshe?

ARVIS: The town's neutral. I've tried to get the people
       to side with the Returners, but... Anyway why on
       earth have you come here?
	   
EDGAR: First, how are your people doing?

ARVIS: They all went... slightly berserk when the Esper was discovered.

BANON: We believe this young woman is our only hope of reaching out to
       that Esper.
	   
ARVIS: My people are dying to know what the Esper looks like.
       Maybe Terra can help restore some order to our town...?
	   
EDGAR: That Esper is either going to save us... or dig us
       and early grave...

SHADOW: Imperial soldiers have built a base somewhere
        beyond the forest.
		
SABIN: Already?

SHADOW: They seem to have their sights set on Doma Castle.

SABIN: So Doma's next huh? I have to reach Narshe immediately!

SHADOW: Your only hope is through Doma. I'll show you the way.

SOLDIER A: Hey have you heard?

SOLDIER B: Oh you mean...

SOLDIER A: Shhh! Quiet down. If Kefka catches us, we're toast

SOLDIER A: If he drives General Leo out of our battalion,
           he'll probably become the next general!
   
SOLDIER B: Don't make me laugh! If someone like him becomes
           a general, I'll go home!
   
SOLDIER A: Shhhh! What if he hears you? You'll be jailed!

SOLDIER B: Alright alright!

    Out emerges Kefka
	
SOLDIER B: Uh oh... Here he comes... back to the waiting zone!

KEFKA: Hey you! You keeping a sharp lookout?

SOLDIER A: Yes sir. You're Kefka, correct? How are you Sir?

KEFKA: Please! Save your petty small talk! Just do your job!

SOLDIER B: Phew! Someone's gotta put that guy away! I'd like to tell
           him to his face he's no General Leo!
   
SOLDIER A: Shhh! Do I always have to tell you to keep it down?! You're
           hopeless! I hate that weirdo, Kefka. I don't even think he's
           human, not like General Leo...
   
SOLDIER B: Agreed.

COMMANDER: You two! We're about to storm Doma Castle...
           You will join the assault team!

COMMANDER: Attack!

    Inside Doma Castle
	
DOMA SENTRY: It's hopeless. We can't keep them out.

OTHER SENTRY: So it's finally happening...

VOICE: A moment Sir! Allow me the honor!


        Faithful retainer to his family's liege,
        with the courage and strength of a
        hundred men...
        (and he never gets used, ever)
		
		
CYAN: If we can fell their commander, they'll surely give up.
      Let us give it a try.
	  
    Back outside Doma Castle
	
DOMA SENTRY: Sir Cyan! Let their commander have it!

    To the Commander

CYAN: I am Cyan, retainer to the King of Doma. I am your worst nightmare...
	  
TROOPER: The general's been defeated! Run!!!

CYAN: Walled up in there, we can wait out our enemy!

    Back to the camp
	
SOLDIER: General Leo. The citizens of Doma seem to be playing a waiting game..
		 
LEO: So that's their strategy.

SOLDIER: General. We're ready to take the castle. Just give the order.

LEO: Patience! If we attack now, we'll have to sacrifice too many lives.

SOLDIER: But General! I'm reayd to lay my life down at any time for the Empire

LEO: You're from Maranda, right?

SOLDIER: Y...yes Sir. Why?

LEO: And your family lives there? Fall in battle, and I'll ahve to deliver
     the bad news... what shall I say to them? You have a life to go back
     to someday. Don't throw it all away for nothing. Emperor Gestahl
     wouldn't want that.
	 
SOLDIER: Yes sir!

DIFFERENT SOLDIER: General Leo! A carrier pigeon from Emperor Gestahl

LEO: What? The Emperor summons me. I must return immediately.

SOLDIER: I understand, Sir.

LEO: Right. I'll leave Doma in your hands.

SOLDIER: Yes, Sir.

LEO: Okay... Just don't jump the gun. Please...

SOLDIER: Sir! Leave it to us, Sir!

LEO: Right.

SABIN: So that's General Leo. He could be my friend, if he weren't my enemy...
	   
KEFKA: Now that Leo's gone, I'll turn this water into a
       flowing river of poison!
	   
LEO: The Emperor has ordered me to return home. I don't want any
     trouble here!
	 
KEFKA: You loser! I'll take care of this situation in no time!

LEO: Don't be pompous! And DON'T forget that they are PEOPLE,
     just like you and me.
	 
KEFKA: We need not spare those lands that gave rise to the Returners!

    Leo has left
	
KEFKA: You just go and be a good little boy...!

    To the soldier
	
KEFKA: Is the poison ready?

SOLDIER: But, General Leo said...

KEFKA: He's no longer here! I'm in charge now. Pour it!

SOLDIER: Some of our people are prisoners inside the castle!
         If we poison the river...
		 
KEFKA: Do it! Take 'em all out!

SABIN: That's inhuman!

KEFKA: Unh? Silence! You're history bub...

    The other exchanges, not important
	
    Poisoning the river...
	
KEFKA: Hee hee! Nothing can beat the music of hundreds
       of voices screaming in unison! Uwa ha ha!
	   
    Meanwhile, Doma
	
DOMA SENTRY: Sir Cyan! The Empire's base is bustling with
             activity. Something must be up!

DOMA SENTRY: Sir Cyan!

CYAN: This is... POISON!

DOMA SENTRY: What lowdown, contemptible...!

CYAN: Guard our liege!

DOMA SENTRY: To the King, on the double!

CYAN: Right! The King's room is near!

    Inside the throne room
	
CYAN: Your highness! Fear not!

KING DOMA: Who's there?

CYAN: Cyan, Excellency.

KING DOMA: Indeed! My sight is going fast... Can't see a thing...

CYAN: Excellency! Hang on!

KING DOMA: Cyan... You have defended the realm since my
           father's days... hack, cough... thank you...
           It's over... Our kingdom is through...

CYAN: Save your strength! Don't talk!

KING DOMA: Go... run to your family... hack... gasp...

CYAN: HIGHNESS!

DOMA SENTRY: Sir Cyan!

CYAN: There have to be some survivors in the castle!

DOMA SENTRY: Let's split up...

    Inside his room
	
CYAN: Elayne! Elayne! Wake up!
      This... this can't be happening!
      Owain... NOT YOU TOO!
      Son... you can't BOTH leave me!
      D... Dear me...

      We can't forgive this! The Empire must pay!

WARRIOR: I am Cyan, retainer to King Doma!

SOLDIER: The enemy! Get ready everyone!

    The rest of the soldier chat not included, but it's more of the same
	
CYAN: Thank you, kind sir!

SABIN: Allow me to thank you! I am Sabin, from Figaro. Now let's scram!

CYAN: But what of my home, my family... my friends?

SABIN: Look... if we stick around any longer we'll have a
       regiment of troops down our throats.
	   
SOLDIER: Got 'em! Over here!

SABIN: Hoo boy... I have a great idea... Come over here.

CYAN: Sir Sabin! What on earth are these?

SABIN: I'll explain later! Relax. Just climb in!

CYAN: Sir Sabin! How might these abominations be manipulated?

SABIN: I'm getting sick of this! Thou art such a pain in the...!
       Confound it all! I'm starting to talk like you!
       Now listen! Just use those levels located by your hands.
	   
CYAN: Sir Sabin! It is I who is in your debt!

SABIN: Forget it. Now come on!

SOLDIER: Hey! What are you doing?

CYAN: Ahhh we can't stop now!

SABIN: Then let's just bust through!

    As they leave the camp
	
SABIN: Can't believe we've made it this far... Say,
       how do we get to Narshe from here?
	   
CYAN: Narshe eh? Only one route, through the forest to the south.

SABIN: All right! It's decided. Let's get going!

CYAN: Sir Sabin!

SABIN: We can't just wander around out here! We have to go on board!

CYAN: Sir Sabin!

SABIN: Don't worry!

CYAN: Sir Sabin!

SABIN: What on earth..?

CYAN: Let me off! This train's haunted!

SABIN: I...it's moving!

CYAN: If we don't get off now...

SABIN: Won't open!

CYAN: We're too late.

SABIN: What's with this train?

CYAN: This is the Phantom Train. It carries the departed to... the other side.
	  
SABIN: Wait a sec... I don't want to go THERE!

CYAN: We all have to go sometime...

SABIN: I have things to do HERE. We have to stop this thing.
       Let's make for the engine.
	
    The no escape thing, I'm gonna leave it out. It's a bunch of no escape
    and what the. It's silly but time consuming and... not gonna do it

CYAN: Gulp...where are we?

SABIN: Hoo boy! Finally got off... We shouldn't be here. Let's go NOW!

Departing?

LOCKE: Nuts! Gotta get to Narshe on the fly...

    The first Merchant:
	
MERCHANT: You're that thief, Locke, aren't you?

LOCKE: Hey! Call me a treasure hunter, or I'll rip your lungs out!

So violent...

MERCHANT: Hey you, come to steal my cider?

Right. So if you slip under the building by the bridge, you don't have to
go up to the Guard. It saves time, steps, and trouble. I guess you get one
less Plumed Hat but who cares! If you do go to the soldier, it's something
along the lines of &quot;scum&quot; followed by &quot;off duty, great!&quot; But all the same,
it's easier to skip it and go under the building through what is clearly
a graphical error that is 100% abuseable

    Some old dude
	
Ah! Cider! Glug, glug. Huh? Secret Passage? Well, there is one that
leads to the rich man's house. Go downstairs and give my grandson
the password. It's uh, umm... I forget!

The password is... Courage! Duh

GUARD: So, the mighty Celes has fallen!

CELES: How can you serve those cowards...

GUARD: Hold your tongue!

CELES: Isn't it true Kefka's going to poison the people of Doma, to the east?

GUARD: Shuddap!

    And Celes finally falls from the punches
	
GUARD: I'd hate to be in your shoes tomorrow! Keep a close eye on her!
	   
CLEARLY-NOT-QUALIFIED: Yes Sir! I can go for days without sleep!

CELES: And you are...

LOCKE: I'm with the Returners. Name's Locke.

CELES: Returners!!! I used to be General Celes... Now I'm
       just a common traitor...
	   
LOCKE: Let's go!

CELES: !? You'd take me along? Thanks but no thanks.
       I can barely walk... I'm grateful, but... even
       if you got me out, you'd never be able to protect me.
       No, I think I'm better off here.
	   
LOCKE: I'll protect you!

Oh, the power of boners...

LOCKE: Trust me! You'll be fine! Let's go!

CELES: Wait. This soldier who has fallen asleep has something
       important on him...

CELES: I can simply absorb the attack with my Runic Blade.

LOCKE: Are you sure you'll be okay?!

CELES: Just you watch!!

    The three (groups) have reached Narshe, and
    a decisive battle is bout to take place

ELDER: I understand all of it... Except... how can we be encouraging bloodshed?

ARVIS: I never said that!

ELDER: Something like it.

BANON: Ha! He's right you know!

ARVIS: Banon!

BANON: Our blood will spill because of you.

BANON: Emperor Gestahl's racing to acquire Magitek power.
       He's set his sights on the Esper that was found here!
       The increased use of magitek power'll surely lead to
       global destruction....
	   
ELDER: The War of the Magi... The mythical battle that
       set mankind back a thousand years... Can this
       really be happening? People will never learn
	   
SABIN: Brother!

EDGAR: Sabin! You're all right! Who's with you?

CYAN: I'm Cyan, retainer to the lord of Doma!

GAU: Gau GAU!

SABIN: The people of Doma were wiped out by the Empire...

CYAN: Kefka poisoned... everyone...

ELDER: Barbaric!

BANON: Elder!

ELDER: But that was only because Doma was collaborating with the
       Returners! If we make that mistake...
	   
LOCKE: That's nonsense!!

TERRA: Locke!

LOCKE: The Empire's poised to attack Narshe right now!

EDGAR: What?!

BANON: Locke. Where'd you hear that?

LOCKE: Celes, here, was one of the Empire's generals...

CYAN: Grrr! I knew she seemed familiar. Sir Gau, out of my way!
      This's General Celes! She torched Maranda! She's an
      Imerial spy! Now stand aside!
	  
LOCKE: WAIT! Celes has joined the Returners! She's fighting
       with us now!
	   
CYAN: But...!

LOCKE: I promised I'd protect her. I WILL NOT back out on my word.

EDGAR: Locke... are you still thinking about... that?

TERRA: I was also an Imperial solder.

CYAN: WHAT!!!

EDGAR: The Empire's evil. But not ALL of its citizens are!

SABIN: Oh this is...

SOLDIER: Emergency!! The Empire cometh!!

    Prepare for walking scenes
	
KEFKA: I don't care what you do here, JUST GET ME THAT ESPER!

SOLDIER: Lord Kefka! There're civilians here!

KEFKA: Exterminate everyone!

SOLDIER: But Narshe is neutral...

KEFKA: Idiot! Read my lips!! Dispose of any who oppose us! March!

    Back inside the war room

ELDER: We really have no choice. Let's make ready for war!

BANON: They're after the Esper.

ELDER: We moved it into the hills.

EDGAR: Then we're going up after it!

    Walking scene 1

EDGAR: Locke has a complicated past. I wouldn't go thinking he's
       fallen for you or something!
	   
CELES: I'm a soldier, not some love-starved twit!

EDGAR: Cold as ice...

    Walking scene 2

CELES: So, you were born with the power of magic!? Isn't it a lovely gift...

TERRA: You... can use magic too?

CELES: When I was a baby I was artificially infused with magic
       and raised as a Magitek Knight.
	   
TERRA: Have you... loved anyone?

CELES: ??? What's that supposed to mean?

    Walking scene 3

CYAN: Don't think for a moment I trust you!

CELES: Fine. Use your own eyes then decide.

    And now a one liner from Kefka
	
BANON: They're coming!

KEFKA: Oho!! It's General Celes, the traitor! How delightful!
       This'll be fun! *laugh*

SABIN: Impossible... right?!

    Terra is freaking out uh oh
	
LOCKE: Terra!! What is it!?

TERRA: Nooo!!

SABIN: Terra 'n the Esper...

EDGAR: There's some kinda reaction!

    Terra versus Esper part 2
	
TERRA: What!? What am I feeling
      Huh? What's going on?
      Please... tell me! Who am I? Who!?
	  
LOCKE: Terra!

CELES: An Esper... I can actually feel its mind

EDGAR: Terra... step away from the Esper...

    And she's gone. Crazy
	
LOCKE: Unhh...

CELES: You're awake?

LOCKE: Where's Terra?

CELES: She changed into a...something, and... took off. She looked like...
       She looked like an Esper
	   
EDGAR: Locke! You okay?

EDGAR: Something happened to Terra. There seems to
       be some connection between Espers and her...
       Anyway, we need to find her. Witnesses saw her
       screaming across the sky to the west.
	   
LOCKE: Let's go! I promised her I'd...

CELES: Locke...

EDGAR: Think, people! The Empire still wants that Esper

SABIN: Banon needs our help, too...

CYAN: A former Imperial solder... But we've no
      choice. We must help her!
	  
EDGAR: Let's split up. Those who aren't searching for Terra will stay</pre><pre id="faqspan-2">
       and guard Narshe. Figaro Castle can shuttle us to the western
       province. Then we'll make for Kohlingen or Jidoor.

LOCKE: Soon, you'll... You're not going to believe what
       awaits us up here! Come on, it's worth a fortune!
	   
RACHEL: Locke! Look out!

LOCKE: RACHEL!!

    Much later...
	
LOCKE: Rachel! Are you awake?

RACHEL: ........? I... I can't remember anything...

    Locke is thrown from the house
	
RACHEL's DAD: Get outta here! It's your fault she's lost her memory!

LOCKE: Wait a minute! She said &quot;Yes!&quot; We were gonna...

RACHEL: Go! I don't know who you are, but ever since
        you came here my parents have been upset!
		
    More time later
	
THIEF: You'd best leave Rachel alone. She's going to have to make
       a new start of it. Locke... your being here doesn't help.
	   
LOCKE: A year passed... When I returned here, I learned that Rachel
       had perished in an Imperial attack. Her memory returned just
       before she passed away. The last thing she uttered was...
       my name... I should never have left her side. I... I failed her...

    The group has reached Terra
	
TERRA: Oooooh...gururururu...

Terra?

RAMUH: She's scared, you know.

Who're you?

RAMUH: This girl is your friend?

Is Terra all right?

RAMUH: You call her Terra......Terra?? How odd...

    Terra convulses around the room
	
RAMUH: She is undamaged. But I fear she can't understand you.
       As for me, I am Ramuh. The Esper, Ramuh.
	   
ESPER!? But don't Espers live in another world?

RAMUH: That doesn't mean we don't live here, too. Espers take a variety of
       forms. Sometimes we live here, taking the shape of humans. You have
       nothing to fear from us.
	   
Why do you hide the fact that you're Espers?

RAMUH: Humans and Espers can't survive together.

But my grandma told me that Espers and people once lived side by side!
Was that just a fairy tale?

RAMUH: No, that was no fairy tale. That was true. We started out as friends.
       Then along came the War of the Magi...
	   
War of the Magi...

RAMUH: It took place... long ago. Espers fought humans who were
       infused with magical power extracted from Espers...
       Fearing our magical powers would once again become a target,
       we fashioned a new realm, and moved there.
       About 20 years ago, humans stumbled upon it... humans who
       knew about Espers, and the secret to Magitek power.
       Thus began a hunt for Espers. Only in this way could Emperor
       Gestahl create his invincible army. In response to this, we
       erected a doorway, and threw the humans out. Even as we speak,
       many of my kind are trapped in the Empire's Magitek Research
       Facility, being... drained of their powers... I fled here to
       avoid a similar fate.
	   
    They put Terra back into bed
	
RAMUH: That's right, relax. I sensed that Terra was in trouble.
       My magic... summoned her here.
	   
Terra's an Esper?

RAMUH: No, she's actually quite different.

Terra looks like she's in pain.

RAMUH: Her very existence strikes fear into her own heart.

How can we help her?

RAMUH: When she accepts this aspect of herself, I think she'll be all right.

We have to do something!

RAMUH: Then free those of my kind imprisoned in Gestahl's Magitek
       Research Facility. One of them can surely help her.
	   
If we find the Magitek Research Facility, you're sure we'll find your people?

Celes: Magitek Research Facility... Your people are...

RAMUH: Like a coward, I escaped leaving the others there. It'll be the
       end of them...
	   
What do you mean?

RAMUH: Gestahl's methods are incorrect. You can't drain a
       live Esper of all its power. It is only when we are
       reduced to Magicite that our abilities can be
       transferred in total...
	   
Pardon?

RAMUH: When we transform into Magicite, our power can be relocated.

Magicite...?!

RAMUH: That's what's left of us when we... pass away.

    In flash three magicite pieces, Kirin, Stray, and Siren
	
RAMUH: These are my comrades who fell while escaping the
       Empire. And I will give you my power, as well...
	   
(So I guess Ramuh commits suicide then huh?)

Old man... are you really gone?

Magicite...?

He traded his power, so that others might live...

Why are you doing this...?

RAMUH: We few can help save many. The War of the Magi must
       not be repeated...
	   
    The two others are now in Zozo
	
Everyone here? I was thinking, ...

EDGAR: Let's talk on the way!

EDGAR: The Empire's trying to drain magic from Espers...

SABIN: This can't be true... Celes?

CELES: I don't remember because I was asleep when they...
       augmented me. But I've heard rumors to that effect.
	   
CYAN: Then we're going in...

EDGAR: We'd best split into 2 groups. We still need to beef up our
       defenses in Narshe.
	   
CYAN: Indeed.

CELES: I'll go to the Empire. I know it well...

SABIN: But alone...?

LOCKE: Don't worry, I'll go with her.

CELES: Locke!

CYAN: You need a hand?

    Pick your team
	
LOCKE: Please wait for us in Narshe. We'll find our way back safely.

If you wish to change group members, head for Narshe.

(Thanks Cyan! Unless we're doing a LLC)

CELES: So... how we gonna get there? The Empire's on the continent
       to the south. No boats go there...
	   
LOCKE: The people of Jidoor, a town to the south, can probably help us.

CELES: Locke.

LOCKE: Yes?

CELES: Why are you coming with me?

LOCKE: Well... There're bound to be treasures there. And besides,
       I've always wanted an inside look at the Empire!

            in trouble...
			
Celes looks just like Maria...?

    There's a note on the ground
	
That PERSON dropped it off.

MASTER: He's the director of the operas here. Everyone just
        calls him &quot;Impresario.&quot; He's been in a tizzy ever
        since that letter arrived.
		
          My Dear Maria,
          I want you for my wife.
          I'm coming for you...

LOCKE: Who's this &quot;Wandering...&quot;? what's-his-name?

MASTER: You born on a farm, son?


        A black jack-play, world-
        traveling, casino-dwelling
        free spirit...
		
		
MASTER: That's Setzer, owner of the world's only airship.

IMPRESARIO: Ah! You again!

LOCKE: I read that letter. Setzer's coming to steal her...

IMPRESARIO: He'll probably appear right at the climax
            of Scene 1. He loves an entrance...
			
LOCKE: Right! If we could only grab him then...!

IMPRESARIO: Dear me, NO! You'll ruin the performance! I'll lose my job!
			
CELES: Then you're history!

IMPRESARIO: This is simply horrid! I want the performance to be a
            success! But I don't want Maria to be abducted...!
			
LOCKE: We'll let him grab her... We'll use Celes as a decoy. After
       she's abducted, I'll follow 'em right to his airship!
	   
IMPRESARIO: Are you made?!! If something should happen to Maria...

LOCKE: That's why the decoy! We'll hide Maria somewhere safe!

IMPRESARIO: Come again?

LOCKE: You said SHE looks like Maria, right?

CELES: Now just a minute...

LOCKE: Celes will be our Maria! She'll lead us to the airship!

IMPRESARIO: Brilliant!

CELES: (rages) W...wait! I'm a GENERAL, not some opera floozy!

(her practicing, sounds terrible)

LOCKE: Not bad, Celes!

ULTROS: Mwa, ha, ha! I'll pretend to be Setzer and foil their little plan!
		
LOCKE: Let's get ready! Celes, it's show time!

ULTROS: D'haaaa! Come on! Read it...!

    Prepare, for the Opera


            The west and east
            were waging war
       Draco, the wests great hero,
         thinks of his love, Maria
       is she safe? is she waiting?

	   
(chocobos attack)


DRACO:
            Oh, Maria
            Oh, Maria
       Please, hear my voice!
      How I long to be with you

	  
      The forces of the West fell,
      and Maria's castle was taken.
      Prince Ralse, of the East,
      took her hand by force.
      But she never stopped yearning
      for Draco...
	  
	  
MARIA:
       Oh my hero, so far away now.
       Will I ever see your smile?
    Love goes away, like night into day.
        It's just a fading dream...

     I'm the darkness, you're the stars.
      Our love is brighter than the sun.
      For eternity, for me there can be,
          only you, my chosen one...

     Must I forget you? Our solemn promise?
     Will autumn take the place of spring?
     What shall I do? I'm lost without you.
            Speak to me once more!

			
DRACO:
        Come Maria! Follow my lead...
               hahaha

			   
MARIA:
          We must part now
           My life goes on
      But my heart won't give you up

          Ere I walk away
        let me hear you say
      I meant as much to you

            So gently
        you touched my heart.
      I will be forever yours.

           Come what may
         I won't age a day
      I'll wait for you, always...

            I knew you'd come.
			
			
RALSE:
            Maria will finally
          have to become my queen
		  
		  
DRACO:

            I'll keep you near...
			
			
RALSE:

(So here's the follow up text)

(After Draco, Locke goes to see Celes)

LOCKE: Aye yai yai! Izzat...you!?

CELES: Locke. Why did you help me escape back there?

LOCKE: I once abandoned someone when she needed me...
       That ribbon suits you
	   
CELES: On with the show! This is the big scene which
       Maria sense that something's happened to Draco!
	   
LOCKE: You'd better check the score one last time.

(After the big Celes performance, we return to Locke)

LOCKE: Well done, Celes.

    I owe you one, so I'm gonna
    jam up your opera!
                  Ultros
				  
(amazing an octopus can write! I guess he does have ink)

LOCKE: Uh oh... better tell the Impresario!

IMPRESARIO: What!!!?

(after Draco rides in, thus ending any opera speech)

IMPRESARIO: But how might he disrupt the opera? ...with that?

ULTROS: Mwa ha ha! Let's see if Maria can shrug THIS off!
        N'ghaaa! This is heavier than I thought! It'll take
        me 5 minutes to drop it!
		
(Can we stop for a moment. First, how did he get a 4 ton object
up there with nobody noticing? Second, how does that 4 ton object
not shatter the beams it's resting on? Those don't look very sturdy.
Third, 5 minutes? What an exact time to schooch an object over to
the edge! This octopus can both write in fine print and move objects
in an exact time! This is incredible! Anyways)

LOCKE: We haven't a second to lose!

IMPRESARIO: Talk to the man in the room to the far right!
            He'll help you get up there!
			
LOCKE: It's as good as done!

    Enter a falling group onto the opera stage
	
IMPRESARIO: Disaster! If the two heroes are flattened,
            the opera's over! Then who'll win the girl?!
			
LOCKE: Neither Draco nor Ralse will save Celes! I, Locke,
       the world's premier adventurer, will save her!
	   
(boo hiss)

IMPRESARIO: Aya... what awful acting!

ULTROS: Silence! You are in the presence of octopus royalty! A
        lowborn thug like you could never defeat me!
		
IMPRESARIO: Hmm.. might as well make the most of this. MUSIC!!

    Just a darn minute! What a performance!!
	
IMPRESARIO: Setzer!

SETZER: I'm a man of my word, music man!

CELES: That's him...?!

(I assume it's probably Locke, as Locke runs up there, and it makes no
sense for Celes to be saying that as she's pulled away but alas that is
what the game says. Props to errors)

IMPRESARIO: What a reversal! Thinking she's Locke's new queen,
            Maria is instead nabbed by Setzer! What fate lies
            in store for her? Stay tuned for part 2!

LOCKE: But this is the tough one! Part 2 begins now! Where's Setzer?
	   
CELES: He's coming.

SETZER: W...who're YOU? You're not Maria!

CELES: Setzer, we need your help. We have to go to
       Vector. We need this ship to get there.
	   
SETZER: Look, if you're not Maria, I don't want you aboard.

CELES: Wait! We were told your ship is the finest vessel in the world.

LOCKE: And that you were the world's most notorious gambler...

(other comments)

SETZER: Come here.

CELES: Yeah...

SETZER: Don't misunderstand me. I'm still not sure if I'm going to help you.

    Some time later
	
SETZER: Phew... the Empire's made me a rich man.

CELES: Stop thinking of yourself. Many towns and villages
       have been smashed by the Empire.
	   
LOCKE: The Empire's also totally rotten! It's using magic
       to enslave the world.
	   
(other comments)

SETZER: The Empire...evil...?

CELES: We all hate the Empire for the same reasons. That's why...

SETZER: You know... you're even more stunning than Maria.

CELES: ????

(Totally fair to point out that if you have Edgar here, he blushes
with Celes. Ahhh same portrait errors)

SETZER: Enough! If you... if Celes becomes my wife, I'll help. Otherwise...

LOCKE: WHAT! Are you stupid!?

CELES: We haven't any choice.

SETZER: Yes! It's settled!

(He could seriously die on this mission. Oh the power of boners)
(But seriously, they didn't want to pressure Terra, and yet with
Setzer they're like scare-tactic-ing him into joining. What a
bunch of filthy hypocrites!)

CELES: But I have conditions... We'll decide with a coin toss.
       If it's heads, you'll help us. If it's tails, I'll go
       with you. Well, Mr. Gambler...?
	   
SETZER: Oho! Fine! I accept!

LOCKE: Listen to yourself! Celes... you can't become his wife! You just can't!

CELES: Ready? I win! Now, honor your part of the bargain!

(Not really, it's a double sided coin! Doesn't that negate the bet?)

SETZER: How...unusual! A coin with idential sides...!

(Hmmm, he really is an honest gambler)

CELES: I think you've been hustled, Mr. Gambler.

SETZER: Ha! How low can you get?! I love it! All right, I'll
        help you. Nothing to lose but my life... My life is
        a chip in your pile! Ante up!
		
    On the deck
	
LOCKE: This unwieldy-looking ship really moves! Could it crash?

SETZER: When things fall, they fall! It's all a matter of fate...

LOCKE: This ship's going to stick out like a sore thumb. Better
       land some distance away.
	   
SETZER: Right. I'll wait on board in case of an emergency.

CELES: Professor Cid.

CID: General Celes! And who might these dubious characters be? Your troops?
	 
CELES: No... you see, ...

CID: Can it be true that you came here as a spy,
     seeking to cause an uprising?!
	 
LOCKE: !? Celes...?

KEFKA: (laughs) So that's it! Magicite... Cid
       you miserable blockhead! Now... General
       Celes!! The game's over. Bring me those
       Magicite shards!
	   
LOCKE: Celes! You... deceived me?!

CELES: Of course not! Have a little faith!

KEFKA: (laughs) G'hee, hee, hee! She has tricked
       you all! Celes, that's so... YOU!
	   
CELES: Locke... please believe me...

LOCKE: I... ...

KEFKA: NOW!! Exterminate all of them!

CELES: Locke... Let me protect you for once... Maybe now...
       Now you'll believe me...
	   
KEFKA: Celes! W...what are you doing? Stop it!!!

    And now, interplanetary travel
	
LOCKE: Celes...

CID: Ooh, ooh... What happened?

    Horrible noises!
	
CID: This is a disaster! Your fighting has caused
     the capsules to rupture! Their contents are spilling out!
     Quick! Over here!
	 
    All we need now is elevator music
	
CID: Kefka has used me... used the Empire. What have I done...?
     The life-energy of those Espers... You've helped me come to
     a decision. I'm going to talk to the Emperor and have this
     stupid war stopped!
	 
CID: Celes... I've known her since she was a baby. I raised
     her as if she was my own daughter! But she was forced
     to become a Magitek Knight, and has done some awful
     things. If I could only talk to her... I'd apologize for
     the way her life has turned out.
	 
    Kefka laughs ominously
	
CID: No! It's Kefka!
     GO!!
	 
    Outside the facility
	
SETZER: I was starting to worry... ? What's up with Celes?

LOCKE: ...

SETZER: We'll talk later. Let's get outta here!

KEFKA: Crud! What a mess!! I don't think so...! You won't get away!

LOCKE: Let's not overstay our visit. We're outta here on the double!

SETZER: Right. Speaking of which... maybe we should be leaving.

Something horrible's coming!!

----------------------------------

ENTER
    The return to Zozo
	
	
LOCKE: I'm worried about Terra. Let's return to Zozo.

SETZER: Terra? Who's that?

LOCKE: I'll explain on the way... about Terra... Espers... the Returners...

(when did the others show up?)

LOCKE: Terra... Magicite!!

TERRA: Father...? I remember it all... I was raised in the Espers's world.

    Enter the flashback, The Esper World...
	
    (To the girl)
MADUIN: Listen well, and think clearly!

    Back inside the house

FAIRY: She's pretty weak. Better let her rest for a moment.

MADUIN: Did I awaken you?

GIRL: You're... an Esper? What's that pendant for?

MADUIN: It's... yours now! It helps protect the Esper World.

GIRL: Esper World... Boy, did I take the low road or what?

MADUIN: The Esper folk are pretty upset, you being a human and all...

GIRL: You the one who... saved me?

ESPER: I am Maduin. I tired living in the human world...

(I can only assume that's supposed to be, TRIED)

      That world is filled with desire, greed, and loathing.
      It's highly infectious...
	  
(I assume it's Maduin but maybe not, the game is unclear)

MADUIN: Are humans and Espers truly... so different?

MADONNA: So... I'm an example of the evil in this world, huh?

(No introduction, she just becomes Madonna)

MADUIN: No, I mean...

(The power of boners folks!)

MADONNA: I'll return to my world tomorrow!

MADUIN: You'll need a guide.

    The next day
	
YOUTH: What's wrong, Maduin?

MADUIN: If you don't want to return to your world,
        you may stay here.
		
MADONNA: But humans and Espers can never coexist...!

MADUIN: How do we know for sure unless we observe for ourselves?

(It's sexy time now...)

How do we know... unless we... observe for ourselves...?

(That's how you serenade the ladies! Also, good thing Maduin looks
kinda like a human. I mean, imagine if Terrato or Shoat were to have
found Madonna; they'd of eaten her right?)

MADUIN: We've given her a name...

MADONNA: What?

(Hold on, you're telling me that the MOM didn't get to name her child?)

MADUIN: It's Terra. Not bad, huh?

    2 years later...
	
Humans!!!!! The nexus between our worlds has opened again!! The wind...
so odd... just like 2 years ago... But something's different now...
Troops have come seeking our magical power. Blast it! They've made it
as far as the Elder's house!

(Sidenote, if you don't click here, the trooper just keeps punching the
fairy over and over and over and over and over, alright just press A)

GESTASHL: Aha! We've finally found it! Those ancient writings told
          us of this world, and described the awesome magical properties
          of these beasts! Grab them! Riches to any man who captures
          an Esper! Go!
		  
    Inside the Elders
	
ELDER: We've no choice... We must do what we've been avoiding...

MADUIN: You mean... the magic barrier?

ELDER: Here's the plan. We'll cause a tempest that'll sweep
       all the nasty creatures out of our realm. Then we'll
       seal the gate... I am the last of our kind able to
       cast this magical seal.
	   
MADUIN: But in your state, you might just...

ELDER: Pass away... but at least we will finally be safe.

MADUIN: Madonna....

MADONNA: I for one will not miss the other side.

ELDER: Let's do it. We have no other choice.

WOLF: This is all because of that human girl!

MADUIN: Nonsense!

WOLF: I'm sure she helped the others find us!

MADUIN: Get a grip on yourself!

WOLF: No! She's one of them! Soon she'll be wearing our hide!

    Madonna goes running out quickly
	
MADUIN: Urghhh!

SOLDIER: Look what popped out!

GESTAHL: Shriek!!! Just when we were in reach of a veritable bonanza...!

MADONNA: Maduin... I'm not their friend...

MADUIN: I understand that!

MADONNA: Thank you...

MADUIN: Can you make it back here?

MADONNA: Sure...

Terra!!!

MADUIN: Madonna!!

GESTAHL: A... human girl? Wh... who is she?

MADONNA: Please... take care... of my baby...

GESTAHL: YOUR girl!? Eh!? Hmmm.. then she's half human
         and half... How absolutely fascinating! Mwa, ha, ha...
         She will help us realize our dream faster than
         we ever imagined!
		 
MADONNA: N...nooooo!!!

GESTAHL: Quiet, my dear!! We will own this world! Ha, ha, ha...

    Back to present time
	
TERRA: That was my father...? I'm the product of an Esper and
       a human... That's where I got my powers... Now I understand...
       I finally feel I can begin to control this power of mine...
	   
LOCKE: So Gestahl must've known the secret of the Espers' power back then.
       And those Espers at the facility were grabbed during that expedition!
       That means Celes's power came... at the expense of an Esper...
	   
SABIN: They can't get away with this! We have to strike back!

TERRA: What's happening in Narshe?

LOCKE: Hmm.. Maybe we should head back that way.

SETZER: The airship's ready!

TERRA: Come on!

    Back onboard the airship
	
(Yeah we're skipping this, no &quot;how to airship&quot;)

ENTER
    Narshe
	
	
GUARD: We've been waiting for you. This way, please...

BANON: Oh, you're here! The people of Narshe have finally
       decided to battle the Empire. How did it go at Vector...?
	   
ARVIS: I see... your plan would combine Marshe's money with
       Figaro's machinery to storm the Empire... not enough
       manpower though...

BANON: We have to open the sealed gate...

TERRA: To the Esper World...?

ARVIS: We'll never beat the Empire without them.

BANON: When the gate has been opened, the Espers can attack from the east.
       We'll storm in at the same time, from the north. No way around it.
       We MUST get the Espers to understand. We have to establish a bond
       of trust between the humans and Espers. Only one person can do this...
	   
TERRA: Half human, half Esper... my existence is proof that such a bond CAN
       exist... I'll do it. I'm the only one who can!
	   
----------------------------------

ENTER
    The Sealed Gate
	
	
This is the sealed gate...

Beyond is the Esper World...

From here on, it's all up to Terra

TERRA: ... ...

KEFKA: (laughs)

Terra!... the gate... quickly!

K... ... Kefka!! You followed us!

KEFKA: U'hee, hee, heeee!!!! The Emperor was right!
       Let Terra fall into your hands, and you'd
       open the gate for us...!
       How does it feel to know you've been working for us?!
       Now I fear you've outlived your usefulness....
	   
You'd better think again Kefka!

KEFKA: Oh dear... ... you wanna fight me?! This is just dreadful!

TERRA: Espers... Please heed my call...

KEFKA: It opened!!

Terra!!!

KEFKA: I, I, I, I feel so anxious.

Something's coming!

KEFKA: Frightful energy!!

KEFKA: Uwaaa!

    Kefka gets swept away as Terra gets swept in
	
Terra!!!

TERRA: ... ... ...

    And the gate is sealed once more
	
Hey! The gate!!!

What about those Espers...?

TERRA: Look, let's return to the airship.

    On return
	
--&gt;What happened?

&lt;--The Espers flew off together

&lt;--Then, the Empire's citizens ran off, as though they were terrified.

&lt;--Which way did the Espers go?

--&gt;Towards the capital... Vector...

    On the airship
	
SETZER: We're almost at Vector.

There! What's that?

LOCKE: What's wrong, Terra?

TERRA: I can feel it... ... It's coming closer and closer...

LOCKE: What do you mean you can feel it?

TERRA: It was ... ... glowing!

LOCKE: What's that? It can't be......! An Esper! It's coming!!!
       Watch out Terra!
	   
SETZER: What was that!?

LOCKE: Setzer, get down!

SETZER: Gulp... ... Espers... ...?

LOCKE: Where are they going?

TERRA: They were mad... ...

LOCKE: They seemed... ... angry.

TERRA: No... ...Stop...! Please, don't go!

SETZER: Forget that... ... what's with this vibration?!
        Is it from the Espers?
		
EDGAR: Um......Setzer!!!! I've lost control!!

GUARD: The Emperor's expecting you. This way...

GESTAHL: I've lost my will to fight...

CID: The Emperor's had a change of heart...

Cid!!

CID: The Espers came to save their friends. When they
     learned the others had perished, they went berserk,
     and trashed the town... Never will I forget their
     shrieks of rage...
	 
SENTRY: We're hanging up our weapons and armor for good.

GESTAHL: The power of those Espers... I had no idea...
         They'll shred the world...! We must get them to
         understand that we are no longer at war.
		 
CID: No human's going to make them sit down and listen...

GESTAHL: But for now my friends... let us feast and rejoice!

CID: There're some people here who'd prefer to keep fighting.
     Please, before we dine, talk to as many soldiers as you
     can! Make them understand!
	 
(Their responses will not be recorded as they are unimportant
the the story aspect of the game. Typical responses though,
use your imagination!)

    That evening, the banquet with the Emperor took place...

TROOPER: This way, please.

CID: You can count me as a returner!

GESTAHL: Imagine! All of us here together, sharing a meal!
         First we must have a toast!
		 
To our hometowns!

GESTAHL: Well then... to our hometowns!

GESTAHL: As you know, Kefka was jailed for his crimes,
         what should we do with him?

Leave him in jail

GESTAHL: Hmm... Well, let's let him stew in his cell for a while.
         Then we'll decide what to do.
		 
GESTAHL: I truly apologize about the poisoning of Doma.
         No one dreamed Kefka would use the poison.
		 
That was inexcuseable!

GESTAHL: I'm so terrible sorry! Kefka's being severely punished
         and we're cleaning up the poison. By the way, with regard
         to General Celes...

Celes is one of us!

GESTAHL: Kefka was lying. General Celes realized the war
         was stupid before anyone else. That's why she
         joined the returners. Any other questions for me?

Why'd you start the war?

GESTAHL: My desire for power got the best of me. Now I've come to my senses
         With your permission, I'd like to talk about the Espers...

One more question please! Why do you want peace now?

GESTAHL: I feel we need each other's help at this time...

One more question please! Why'd we have to talk to your men?

GESTAHL: Some of my men refuse to embrace pease. I felt they'd
         understand if they actually met you face to face.

Let's talk about Espers...

GESTAHL: My Empire's been decimated by the Espers that emerged
         from the Sealed Gate. They're acting spiteful. Unless
         they're stopped, theyll rip the world asunder!

Yes, the Espers have gone too far.

GESTAHL: After the Espers went on their rampage, I knew I couldn't
         go on with my war I asked myself why I had started the
         war in the first place... By the way, about those
         questions you asked me... which did you ask first?
		 
Why'd you start the war?

GESTAHL: Right. Anyway, More than anything I want peace.
         That is my true dream, I want you to understand that!
		 
CID: You seem a bit tired. Care for a rest break?

Yes, let's take a break.

GESTAHL: Is there anything you wish to hear me say?

The your war is truly over...

GESTAHL: I understand. I've ordered this war to be over! Now I
         must ask for a favor... After devastating my Empire,
         the Espers headed northward towards Crescent Island.
         They must be found! We must tell them we're no longer
         their enemy. After all I have put them through, it is
         up to me to set things right. That is why, I need to
         borrow Terra's power. Only she can bridge the gap
         between Esper and human. We must make for the Crescent
         Island aboard the freighter from Albrook.
         Will you accompany me?

Yes

GESTAHL: I'll have my finest warrior accompany us! General Leo!

LEO: I'm General Leo. Nice to meet you. I'll be waiting
     for you in Albrook.
	 
GESTAHL: We must find the Espers and come to terms with them!
         You are our last hope!

LOCKE: If Terra goes, I'll go.

TERRA: Locke... Thank you...

LOCKE: The rest of you wait here. I smell a rat...

EDGAR: Agreed... It's hard to trust the Emperor just like that

CYAN: We'll stay here and investigate.

LOCKE: Please do. Leave no stone unturned!

EDGAR: Right. And you be careful!

(And if you do all of that, and talk to the 24 troops, you get
everything! Good luck with that)

(So, it's not required, but it is nice backstory)

CID: Wow, what a ship!

SETZER: That landing really messed up the engine. It'll take
        a while to fix...
		
CID: I'll help. No machine can stump me!

SETZER: Don't touch anything!

CID: Go kill time in the casino! I can speed this crate up!

SETZER: ... ... You little...!! Get outta my sight!

CID: But I could really make this thing hum...!

TERRA: You love this ship, more than anything, huh?

SETZER: Actually, when I was young there was something I was mad about...

TERRA: ...Huh?

SETZER: In my youth I dreamed of having the world's fastest airship.

TERRA: You mean.......

SETZER: At that time there was a young girl who piloted the
        Falcon, the fastest vessel ever made. Sometimes we
        were the worst of rivals... but other times we were
        the best of friends. We always egged each other on
        to go faster and higher. When she disappeared along
        with her ship... I felt like I lost my spirit...

LEO: Is something wrong?

LOCKE: No...

LEO: Our departure isn't till tomorrow. I've arranged some lodging for you.
     Please, get some rest.

CELES: .....

    Celes runs away
	
LOCKE: Celes...

    Head to the innkeeper
	
INNKEEPER: General Leo told us all about you. By all means...

    Middle of the night
	
LOCKE: Celes...

LOCKE: Come on...! Why won't you speak to me?

LOCKE: Even if it was only a little... I doubted you...
       But I'm still your friend...
	   
    Celes is not buying it and leaves
	
LOCKE: Celes!

    The next morning
	
LEO: Right. Let's go.

    On board the USS Gestahl (I don't know I made it up)
	
SOLDIER: All systems A-O-K

LEO: We should arrive tomorrow morning. Why not rest until then?

    Middle of the night
	
LEO: You all right? Looks like you're feeling better...

TERRA: Funny, isn't it... I was used by the Empire... even
       had my thoughts ripped from me... but here I am
       cooperating with the &quot;enemy&quot;...
	   
LEO: People are people. Not all of us are like Kefka.

TERRA: What... what's with you?

LEO: I knew you were being used as a kind of biological weapon...
     And because I didn't do anything about it, I'm no different
     than Kefka...
	 
TERRA: I'm the product of a human and an Esper... Will I ever
       be able to love someone?
	   
LEO: Of course!

TERRA: But... I haven't felt that way yet...

LEO: You're just young. But I understand what you mean.
     I understand only too well...
	 
TERRA: But... I want to know what love is...now!

    A door opens
	
TERRA: Who is it?

SHADOW: Thought I'd sleep out under the stars.

TERRA: Did you hear... what we were just talking about?

SHADOW: I didn't mean to overhear anything.

TERRA: Umm...

SHADOW: I can't help you. You must look within for answers.
        Terra. In this world are many like me who've killed
        their emotions. Don't forget that.
		
    Terra leaves, Locke shows up
	
LOCKE: Urgh... Uooh... Argh...

(he gets seasick alright? The only thing worth mentioning is
&quot;Not a word of this to anyone else, o shrouded one...&quot;)

    The next day. Presumably Locke feels better
	
LEO: We're almost at Crescent Island. When we disembark, we'll
     split into two groups. Celes and I will form one group.
     Terra, you go with Locke and Shadow. If you spot the Espers,
     report at once!

STRAGO: Espers? Espers... Hmm... Not really familiar with that word.

LOCKE: But you've heard it before?

STRAGO: Nope, uhn uhn... Can't say I have. Honestly can't say I have!

STRAGO: Hey... HEY! What in blazes! What you doin?

                    of life...
					
					
RELM: Grandpa. Who are these people? Friends? Can they use magic too?

STRAGO: Yaa! Hush!

RELM: What a cute doggy!

SHADOW: Get away. He bites.

STRAGO: Go to your room!

RELM: I will not! What a fussy old man!

STRAGO: Please... leave us!

RELM: Well... all right...

STRAGO: Hoo boy... seems to like your dog...

RELM: What a sweet puppy!

STRAGO: This is terrible... Sorry.

SHADOW: No problem. The dog usually doesn't like people, though...

STRAGO: Please excuse her. She's just young.

LOCKE: Hmmm...

STRAGO: This is just a back-water village. We can tell you nothing
        about your Espers...
		
LOCKE: I see... There's something wrong here...

TERRA: Let's have a look around.

LOCKE: Thanks for your time!

STRAGO: Sorry I couldn't have been more helpful!

SHADOW: Interceptor! Come!

RELM: Oh, all right...

    And somebody falls asleep with the cig still in their hand...
	
STRAGO: This is awful! Relm... she's...

TERRA: Relm's in danger?

STRAGO: Yes! She was at a neighbor's house when a fire broke out. I

        Won't you help?
		
LOCKE: Shadow!

SHADOW: Interceptor... Where are you?!

STRAGO: Relm's inside that house!

STRAGO: Relm!

LOCKE: What're you doing?

Flames be GONE!!!

MAYOR: Magic is forbidden!

TERRA: Magic...?!

STRAGO: I don't care! Relm's inside!!!

Flames be Gone!!!

Mayor!!

MAYOR: All right. We really have no choice. Stand back.

Flames be GONE!!! x3

STRAGO: It's no use. The fire's too strong!

MAYOR: I think that's because they keep so many Fire Rods in here...

STRAGO: I'm going in!

TERRA: Wait... I'm going too.

LOCKE: Count me in. You'd better stay out here, gramps.

STRAGO: Fool! I may be old, but I'm not powerless!

RELM: Yes. Thanks, Grandpa!

STRAGO: Save your thanks for these people.

RELM: Thank you...

STRAGO: I guess our town's little secret is out now...

LOCKE: Can everyone here use magic? What's going on here?

STRAGO: This is... the village of Mage Warriors... Long ago humans
        used Magicite to gain magical powers. They came to be known
        as Mage Warriors.
		
LOCKE: But I thought they perished centuries ago...

STRAGO: After the War of the Magi, the Espers fled to their new
        world behind the sealed gate. They wished to live peacefully
        without fear of being used by humans. They left us here to
        fend for ourselves... But we were despised by normal people.
        Everyone felt we had begun that war... They sent people to hunt
        us down like animals. There weren't even any trials...
		
TERRA: Even though the only difference was that you could use magic...?

STRAGO: A few Mage Warriors escaped and found their way here. They were
        our ancestors. Our powers have weakened over time, but some of
        it remains.
		
TERRA: Look, if you're up to it, we could use your help.

STRAGO: So, you're after the Espers, eh...? Well, I owe you for
        saving Relm. I'll help you find your Espers.
		
RELM: Me too!

STRAGO: I don't think so.

RELM: What a fuddy duddy.

LOCKE: But... where do we start looking?

STRAGO: Hmm... If they're here, they must be hiding in the mountains
        to the west.
		
LOCKE: Why there?

STRAGO: Those mountains have powerful magical properties. They say
        the Espers were created there...
		
TERRA: Maybe they're drawn to that place?

LOCKE: I think it's worth a look.

    And Shadow is gone again
	
SHADOW: Don't misunderstand me. I just wanted my dog back.

LOCKE: Going somewhere?

SHADOW: I'll search for the Espers in my own way.

SHADOW: Interceptor, come!

TERRA: &quot;The&quot; Statues?!

LOCKE: Some faint letters are carved on the back of the stone figures...
       Say, old man, what else can you tell us about these goddesses?
	   
STRAGO: They quite literally created magic, as we know it.

LOCKE: So, they're the goddesses of magic, then?

STRAGO: You could say that.

TERRA: I can feel their power...

STRAGO: The Statues are the source of all magic. It's said the
        Espers made these images, and put them in a very special place.
        These represent power beyond all comprehension...
		
TERRA: Our Espers no doubt came to this island to bask in
       all this magical power!
	   
LOCKE: Say, old timer, what happened to the stone goddesses?

STRAGO: Legend has it that they're hidden somewhere beyond 
        the reach of humans. I'd say they're beyond the sealed gate...
		
TERRA: I wonder if the barrier that protects that place
       is generated by those stone goddesses?
	   
LOCKE: Phew...what a story.

TERRA: If those Espers were attracted here by these statues,
       they must be around here somewhere!
	   
LOCKE: I think it's worth a look.

    The statue on the LEFT
	
        The birth of magic... 3 goddesses were banished here.
        In time they began quarreling, which led to all-out
        war. Those unlucky humans who got in the way were
        transformed into Espers, and used as living war
        machines...
		
    The statue in the MIDDLE
	
        The Espers created these statues as a symbol of their
        vow to let the goddesses sleep in peace. The Espers
        have sworn to keep the goddesses' power from being
        abused.
		
    The statue on the RIGHT
	
        The goddesses finally realized that they were being
        laughed at by those who had banished them here. In
        a rare moment of mutual clarity, they agreed to seal
        themselves away from the world. With their last ounce
        of energy they gave the Espers back their own free will,
        and then transformed themselves into stone. Their only
        request was that the Espers keep them sealed away for
        all eternity.
		
    Ultros comes in of course. But it is unimportant so not included

RELM: Are these... Espers?!

STRAGO: What about you?

TERRA: I didn't think they'd look so...

LOCKE: Gramps, take Relm and clear outta here!

YURA: Halt!

RELM: What is it?

STRAGO: I sense some immense magical power in Terra... It... frightens me...
		
LOCKE: I wonder if she's gonna go ballistic again?!

YURA: You're somehow different... I sense a familiar power
      radiating from you...
	  
TERRA: Yes.

STRAGO: You're the Espers that fled through the sealed gate?

YURA: As a rule, we are not allowed to visit to your world.
      We few had gathered near the gate, and were wondering
      how we could save the Espers that had been kidnapped.
      It was just a coincidence that Terra appeared when
      she did...
	  
TERRA: I felt... your presence... through the gate.

YURA: We bolted the moment Terra opened the gate. But once
      in your world, we lost control of our powers. We completely
      leveled a city... and took some innocent lives...
	  
TERRA: That's what happened to me! I lost all control of my power...

STRAGO: There must be something in your world that
        allows you to focus your power differently.
        You must use caution while in our world...
		
YURA: We are deeply sorry to have caused you humans such suffering and pain.

LOCKE: The past is history. The Empire seems to want
       to talk peace with you. Why not come with us?
	   
YURA: They would forgive us so easily?

LOCKE: Let's go to Thamasa and talk with General Leo.

TERRA: Right!

    Back in Thamasa
	
LOCKE: General Leo.

LEO: Locke... you're back! And you've made the Espers
     understand our desire for peace!
	 
LEO: I am General Leo. May I have your name please?

YURA: I am called Yura. We have done something inexcusable
      to your people. This probably isn't the time or place
      to ask for your forgiveness, but...
	  
LEO: Speak no further. It is we who owe you an apology.
     We hungered for your power... How close we came to
     reenacting the War of the Magi!!!
	 
YURA: We must pust this all behind us.

LOCKE: I believe our job is finally over! I, for one, could
       use some peace and quiet... (maybe some TNA)
	   
CELES: Let's return to Vector.

LOCKE: Celes...

CELES: Please, not another word.

RELM: I'm too hot, Grandpa.

STRAGO: Kids!!!

KEFKA: (laughs) Hee, hee...! How 'bout a little Magitek mayhem!

LEO: Kefka! What ARE you doing?!

KEFKA: G'ha, ha, ha! Emperor's orders! I'm to bring the Magicite
       remains of these Espers to his excellency! Behold! A Magicite
       mother lode!!
	   
    Kefka begins his spree
	
KEFKA: Idiots! I don't care for the appearance of this pitiful
       little hamlet... so burn it!!!
	   
LEO: Kefka! NO!!

KEFKA: Shut up!

    Leo wakes up after being nearly killed

LEO: Kefka! Your behavior is dishonorable! I can't allow this!

    Leo wins! Or does he...
	
KEFKA: Ah... Leo... always the consummate soldier...

LEO: Where are you, Kefka... Show yourself!

KEFKA: E-M-P-E-R-O-R   G-E-S-T-A-H-L
       I need you here.
	   
GESTAHL: Leo...

LEO: My liege!

GESTAHL: I'm sorry I deceived even you, Leo. My purpose has
         been to gather Magicite, and grow powerful... Please
         understand me...
		 
LEO: But Emperor!

GESTAHL: Don't say anything. I understand how you feel.

KEFKA: Uwee, hee, hee... That's right! What we have to do
       now is to collect Magicite!
	   
LEO: But my liege... what have I been fighting for...?

GESTAHL: Leo, I'd like you to take a nice, long snooze...!
         Very long! Uwa, ha!
		 
    Holy shit it's Kefka!
	
LEO: !!!

KEFKA: So... you think you hit me?! That was simply my shadow!
       And how did you like my Gestahl? I should've been on
       the stage! Well, General... You're such a goody two-shoes!
	   
LEO: Shut up, Kefka! I oughtta...

KEFKA: Oh! A threat...? You're such a violent little brute!
       I'll tell your &quot;liege&quot; I had to exterminate a traitor...!
	   
KEFKA: Hate...hate...HATE!!!

    The Espers are responding!
	
KEFKA: Whoa! Yes, I feel some incredible magic power here, today!
       Wave after wave of pure, magical energy...
	   
       I'd say you're all charged up, boys and girls... or whatever...
       Say, remind me to show you my Magicite collection someday!
       You might see a few familiar faces!!! Now for a little
       Magicite hocus-pocus! First, let's neutralize your abilities.
       Now, little Espers... Let's see whatcha got!
	   
       Eh?! You wanna take me on? Fine. Here I am...
	   
       Imagine! Thinking you could defeat ME!! This is rich! Mwa, ha, ha!
       Now, my little Magicite pretties... come, and help me build the
       magical empire of &quot;Kefka&quot;!
	   
       G'haw, haw... Ooh! They're warm to the touch! What treasures!
	   
       This is ridiculous! I had no idea you were such wimps!
       Time to put a stop to all of this. Phew... I think I have
       plenty of Magicite for the time being... that is, until I
       make my way through your precious sealed gate!!
	   
       I don't believe this! (laughs)
	   
    Later
	
TERRA: General Leo... People only seem to want power. Do they
       really want to be like me? I... I wanted to learn so much
       more from you...
	   
    In limps Intercept. Who has a nasty wound
	
LOCKE: We not only lost Leo, but Shadow, too... Curse the Empire!

LOCKE: This'll have to do...

CELES: He was so gentle...

RELM: I'll go with you.

LOCKE: Now I'm worried about Edgar and the others...

TERRA: I wish I could say they were safe...

    Hah! Of course they are
	
SETZER: We've been had!! The Emperor is a liar!

CYAN: Thanks to Edgar, we escaped before anything bad happened...

LOCKE: Way to go, Edgar!

EDGAR: I got to know the gal who brought us tea. After a while,
       just blurted out the whole crooked plan.
	   
SABIN: So... you finally hit pay dirt, eh?

EDGAR: Watch your mouth! There're ladies present! I was a perfect gentleman.

LOCKE: General Leo's gone... Kefka did him in...

CYAN: Sir Leo?! Gone?! What a waste... He was their finest soldier...

EDGAR: We need to rethink our plans. Let's return to the airship.

STRAGO: May I accompany you?

EDGAR: Who're you?

LOCKE: He's on of this town's citizens.

TERRA: He's descended from the Mage Warriors of your...
       I think he can be a big help.
	   
STRAGO: We must expect the Empire to flex its new-found muscle soon.

RELM: Me too!

STRAGO: I don't think so.

SABIN: Yeah, right kid!

RELM: What? Who is this puffed up aerobics instructor, anyway?

SABIN: Kid's got quite a lip!

RELM: Aaaack! I'm gonna paint your portrait!

Uwaaa! S...stop!

STRAGO: All right all ready! If you insist...
</pre><pre id="faqspan-3">
RELM: That's better!

SABIN: Let's go!

RELM: What's wrong, lover boy?

EDGAR: How old are you?

RELM: 10... why?

RELM: I'm coming along, too.

EDGAR: You've grown up entirely too fast! Lighten up, okay?!

    On the airship later
	
SETZER: The Empire's after the sealed gate! They're looking
        for some statues or something.
		
STRAGO: NO!!!

    At the gate
	
GESTAHL: Oh, those silly Espers! To think they opened the
         gate themselves! The Statues should be just ahead.
         If we can just get our hands on them, we'll have
         everything we ever dreamed of!
         Come quickly!
		 
    Back to the ship
	
CELES: What's wrong, Terra?

TERRA: The island... the world is groaning in pain...

    And to the floating, island, of doom...
	
GESTAHL: Fuwa, ha, ha! Now THIS is power! This, and my
         Magicite... now nothing can stop me!
		 
    Back to the ship
	
STRAGO: The beginning of all magic...

TERRA: Those?

STRAGO: It is said that they somehow neutralized each
        other's power, then sealed themselves away...
        If the 3 statues should ever be moved out of
        alignment, the resulting inbalance of power
        would rearrange the face of our planet...
		
TERRA: What?!

----------------------------------

    It doesn't fit in anywhere, but if you go to Figaro with
    Sabin and Edgar in the party and take a nap, then you get
    the following cutscene.

ENTER
    Figaro Castle
	
	
SABIN: Hmm... Castle hasn't changed much...
       And yet it's all different... Mom and Dad are gone...
       Everyone's gone... Since that day...
	   

        ...tonight... took a turn for the worse...
        ...there's a chance he might...
		
        Nooo...! Y...you're wrong...! This can't be...
		
MATRON: The King... he's...

EDGAR: Sabin! Sabin!

SABIN: My father! I don't believe this. B... brother...
       waa, ahhh, ahhh...
	   
EDGAR: So... They went and told you...

MATRON: Edgar! Here you are... Your father... He just
        uttered his last wish that Figaro be divided
        between you...
		
SABIN: This is NONSENSE!! Everyone's saying that the
       Empire poisoned Dad... And the only thing on
       your minds is &quot;Who's going to be the next
       king?!&quot; You're all pathetic! No one cared
       when Mom passed away, either...
	   
MATRON: That's not...

    Sabin goes and is aggressive towards Matron
	
SABIN: You were as bad as any of 'em!

EDGAR: Sabin...

SABIN: Empire of murderers... They won't get away with this!

EDGAR: Matron... Please leave us...

    At the top...
	
SABIN: I'm otta here! I'm forsaking this war-sick realm
       for my dignity and freedom. You said you were sick
       of it too, right?!
	   
EDGAR: ...freedom... What'll happen to this realm if
       we both leave? And what would Dad say...? Sabin,
       let's settle this with a toss of a coin. If it's
       heads, you win. We'll choose whichever path we want,
       without any regrets. Okay?
	   
       This is for Dad!
	   
(We know if you have Sabin and Edgar when you meet Setzer for
the first time, that Edgar used a same-sided coin)

    This is present day, no more flashback

EDGAR: And then, you opted for your freedom.
       It's been... 10 years. The little shrimp's
       grown into a whopping lobster!
	   
SABIN: And you're a king crab!

EDGAR: Sabin... I often wonder if he'd be proud of me...

SABIN: Don't you ever doubt that!

EDGAR: 10 years...

SABIN: Where has the time gone...?

EDGAR: Here's to a couple of confused grownups!
       Here's to Dad...
	   
SABIN: ...to Mom... and to Figaro.

GESTAHL: Ooh! I've got goose bumps! What power...

CELES: Emperor Gestahl! Please, stop this madness!

GESTAHL: Celes... Come to me, my pretty! You and Kefka
         were given life to serve me!! It is your birthright
         to rule the world with me!!
		 
KEFKA: Kill the others and we'll overlook your treachery!
       Take this sword! Take care of them. Immediately!!
	   
GESTAHL: Celes... together we can rule an entire world! Think of it!

CELES: Power only breed war... I wish I'd never been... born.

    Celes stabs Kefka

KEFKA: Ouch!! B..blood? You... vicious brat!
(He makes some weird noises, goes on about hating her)
       Goddesses... you were born only to fight. I implore you...
       show me your power!!
       I command you! Give me your power! Arrrgh! Curses!

    The statues glow some
	
KEFKA: Listen to me, or you'll regret it! Give me... POWER!

GESTAHL: Kefka, stop it! Revive those statues, and you'll destroy
         the very world we're trying to possess!
		 
KEFKA: Shuddap!

GESTAHL: Kefka! Are you nuts?!

KEFKA: Nuts...?! Emperor! Don't disturb me! I'm showing them
       the meaning of power!
	   
GESTAHL: I don't think so, friend. Your days are over.
         Now relax... I'm simply going to put you to
         sleep with the very power you unleashed...
		 
         What's so funny?! Very well. It is only fitting
         that you go to sleep laughing!

KEFKA: How? Simple! I'm standing within the field of the Statues!
       Their strong field absorbs all magic sent their way! Or
       didn't you notice?!
	   
GESTAHL: ....!!

KEFKA: And now, Statues! You've shown me a sign! It is time you
       show this old man your true power!
	   
GESTAHL: No! Kefka!! Don't do something stupid...

KEFKA: I command you Statues!

    A bolt shoots
	
KEFKA: I....incredible!

    Another
	
       You're way off!! Where're you aiming?!
	   
    Another
	
       Whoa! More to the right!
	   
    Another
	
       Run! Run! Or you'll be well done!
	   
    It hits him
	
       YES!!!!
       Poor old... Oh well, what a worthless excuse of an Emperor!!
	   
GESTAHL: There'll be no one to worship us...

    Kefka throws him from the island
	
CELES: Snap out of it, Kefka!

    Kefka strikes Celes, and then rearranges the Statues
	
CELES: Oh, that's really smart, Kefka! Disturb their delicate
       balance, and they'll go haywire...!
	   
    A whistle as Shadow flies in
	
KEFKA: Who're you?!

    Shadow pushes the Statues, trapping Kefka
	
KEFKA: Nooooo!

SHADOW: Go! There are people counting on you! Don't worry about me!
        Run!! I can't stop this chain reaction! I'll see you again.
        Count on it!
		
KEFKA: You can't escape me!!

    At the end, assuming you wait till 5 seconds

SHADOW: I'll be blown to bits before I can even collect my pay...

CID: Celes... at last...! You're finally awake!

CELES: I... feel like I've been sleeping forever...

CID: For one year actually... I thought you were out for good.

CELES: A whole year... You've watched over me the whole time?

CID: Yes, and I'm about out of energy. We're on a tiny, deserted
     island. After the world crumbled, I awoke to find us here
     together with a few strangers.
	 
CELES: The world...! So it wasn't just a dream. Where are
       my friends? Where's Locke...?
	   
CID: I don't know. I only know we're here... Maybe we're
     the only people left alive... Since that day, the
     world's continued its slide into ruin. Animals and
     plants are dying... The few others who washed up here
     with us passed away of boredom and despair.
	 
CELES: My friends... they're probably all gone...

CID: Celes... you're the closest thing to family that I have...
     we could just live out our lives here peacefully...
	 
CELES: I suppose so, Cid... or should I say Granddar?
       May I call you that?
	   
CID: Gramps, eh? I'm overwhelmed! All of a sudden I have
     a granddaughter! Cough... wheeze...
	 
CELES: My long-lost Granddad...

CID: Ha, ha...hack...cough!

CELES: Hey, are you hungry?

CID: I... haven't eaten in 3 or so days, ever since I became ill.

CELES: What would you like?

CID: Well, unless I ask for fish, I won't get anything! That's
     all there is here!
	 
CELES: I'll go catch some.

(Actually, we won't. While the dialogue changes some from saving Cid
to letting him pass away; it makes a much better, much more heartfelt
and dreadful situation if he dies while Celes is collecting fish and/or
preparing a meal for him. Or in this case, while she waits 90 seconds
standing outside the door for him to die. Sometimes I'm quite cruel)

CELES: Granddad, you have to eat, or else...
       W...what's the matter? Cid...
	   
    Cid dies... it really is a sad moment

CELES: No... NO!! You promised you'd stay here with me!!
       Granddad, ANSWER ME! Tell me you're just joking!
	   
    Celes goes to &quot;suicide hill&quot;
	
CID: Those others who were here... when they were feeling
     down they'd take a leap of faith from the cliffs up
     north... perked 'em right up!
	 
CELES: Everyone's gone... Even Locke, who promised to watch over me...
       The world's slowly ebbing away...
	   
    Don't do it CELES! Shit
	
CELES: Phew... Why did you nurse me back to health? Did
       I ever ask you to help me?!
	   
(She's yelling at a bird, she's lost it)

       A bandada??? No... it can't be... Hey you! Where'd you
       get this?! Is the person who healed you still alive?
       Answer me!
	   
       He's alive... Locke's still alive!!!
	   
    That's when she finds Cid's letter
	
	
        You need to leave! The others are surely
        waiting for you! Find the stairs next to
        the stove. Down them lies your road to freedom.

CELES: You needed to use them...

EDGAR: Bingo. I had to wait until they led me to their secret cave.

SETZER: Mwa ha! All right... you win! I'm starting to feel lucky!!
        Thanks... I needed that. Now, let's go visit Daryl's Tomb.
        We're gonna get us another one... Airship that is!
		
----------------------------------

ENTER
    Daryl's Tomb
	
	
CELES: This person... She was your friend?

SETZER: Yeah. She was a piece of work. Nothing scared her...
        Could be anything lurking down here, so keep your eyes peeled!

    Enjoy some walkin' music
	
SETZER: This brings back a lot of memories.

    Setzer and Daryl are in a room
	
DARYL: This experimental airship is probably a bit unstable...

SETZER: You can't be serious! What are you trying to prove?!

    Another room, no fireplace this time
	
DARYL: If something should happen to me, the Falcon's yours!

SETZER: Nonsense! I'll win the Falcon from you when I whip you in a race!
        You'd better clear outta my way!
		
DARYL: Big talk, buster!

    The Falcon is flying around the World of Balance
	
SETZER: There's nothing like flying!

DARYL: Come on! Stop lagging back there!
       Or do you like chewing on my wake!
	   
SETZER: Listen to you!

DARYL: This time's for real. I'm going to break every record!
       I'll be known as the woman who flew closest to the stars!
	   
SETZER: Be back before sunset! I'll be waiting for you on our hill.

    Transition to a sun-setting hillside where Setzer looks sad
	
  The wreck of the Falcon was found a full year later, in a distand land...
  
    Back to the Falcon
	
SETZER: I restored the craft, and then put it to rest down here.

EDGAR: This is THE Falcon?

SETZER: I put it in storage. I couldn't bear to look at it.
        But now it just may save us...
		
    Sweet new airship!
	
EDGAR: I finally think we're gonna pull this off!

CELES: We can attack Kefka's tower from the air!

EDGAR: The Falcon's going to give us one last chance at that guy...

SETZER: But first we need to find our friends!

EDGAR: Right. First things first. For once I feel hopeful!

CELES: Hey! A bird!

CELES: Setzer! Follow that bird!

SETZER: Buy why?

CELES: I don't know! Something inside just tells me it's important...

So I guess you're supposed to go to Maranda, then to Zozo. I say to hell
with that, Cyan sucks. The following order of dialogue then follows what I

SABIN: Wait!

CELES: Sabin! You're alive!

       But... fortunately I was wrong! Now I know they're all

TERRA: Oh! I'm so glad to see that you're safe! I've missed you!

Terra... come on, let's go! Unless we stop Kefka, all's lost

TERRA: I...

       That is I... um... I can't fight any longer...
       The very day the world fell, Kefka turned some kind
       of beam on this town. Almost all of the adults perished
       trying to save their children...
	   
       There were only children here... the moment I arrived
       I felt needed...
	   
DUANE: You can't take Terra away!

KATARIN: Duane... Please excuse him. It's just that if
         Terra goes, she takes with her the very spirit of
         our survival...
		 
TERRA: I don't know why these kids need me... But they've made
       me feel things I've never felt before. The moment I
       sensed this, I lost my will to fight. I can honestly
       say I don't know what's going on inside of me...
       And the more I try to understand it, the less inclined
       I am to fight.
	   
KID: Help!!! Run!!! Phunbaba's coming!!

TERRA: Phunbaba's an ancient demon who was released when
       the world was undone.
	   
    After beating Phunbaba
	
TERRA: I've really lost it... my fighting edge...

Mama! Are you okay?!

TERRA: I'm staying here. As you can see, I can't be of any help to you.
       And besides, the children really need me.
	   
But Terra...!

TERRA: Maybe after a little more time passes... I need to understand what's
       happening to me...

       I've been an awful husband... But I'm learning.
       Please, come back with me.
	   
    Phunbaba is back

Not much dialogue though until you win

Monster again... I'm afraid... I'm always afraid...

LITTLEGIRL: Mama... It is you, isn't it! I can tell...

TERRA: I... I can fight! Finally... I understand that feeling...
       even though I kept it buried for so long. I'm sure it's
       called....... Love! I now realize that we must fight for
       the future of our children.
	   
       Duane... Katarin needs your help... so does your new baby.
       Listen children, your &quot;mama&quot; has to go away for a while.

That looks like... Magicite...

LOCKE: Correct! Legend has it that ages ago the Phoneix
       was turned to stone... And many legends are based
       on facts... This has some major cracks in it
       though... I fear it may have lost its power
       over time... I wasn't able to save Rachel...
       I've lost all sense of purpose... My life will

        I have to leave again soon...
        But I have something I must tell you...
		
LOCKE: ....

RACHEL: Locke... With you I was so happy... In the instant
        that the accident occurred, I thought only of you...
        And about the joy you brought me. Thank you, Locke...
        I'll never forget you...
		
    Phoenix fades from Rachel
	
LOCKE: RACHEL!!!!

RACHEL: I have to go now... I'll always love you...
        You must now cast off the anguish you've been harboring
        inside for so long... Today I set your heart free.
        You must learn to love yourself again, and regain
        your self respect.
		
        ... Phoenix! Be reborn again! And give your power to.. Locke!!

      I learned of that poor girl when I passed through Maranda.
      When I heard that she sent a letter each day, but never
      received any replies... Something inside me snapped...

RELM: Huh?! What are you talking about?

Now... what was a monster doing in that picture?!

OWZER: It all started when I bought a stone at the Auction House.
       I took one look at it and suddenly felt I needed a portrait
       of Starlet. I asked several artists, but none coule muster
       enough skill. It was then that I heard about Relm's amazing
       ability. I brought her here, and put her to work. But while
       she was painting, that thing came along... It must have been
       enticed here by that stone.
	   
Where is the stone

OWZER: The stone? Over on that bookshelf.

This is Magicite...

OWZER: Phew. I don't need any more bad luck. Just take it and go!

STRAGO: I spent too many years of my life hunting that thing.
        It is my obsession, not yours.

      You're my Grandfather. I can't sit idly by and watch you go.

        implies, the Hidon is extremely difficult to find. Unless I

        your wounds healing, Gungho?
		
GUNGHO: Eh? Oh, they're fine...

        before I knew it, Hidon appeared! I stared Hidon
        straight in the eye, lifted my staff, and let him
        have it! I wanted to show my enemy the true meaning
        of the word, &quot;hero&quot;!

RELM: Wait! First let me thank you. You gave Grandpa a reason
      to go and defeat something that had tormented him for
      decades! Even if YOU were faking, that creature meant
      business!
	  
GUNGHO: What a granddaughter he's raised! Amazing!

KEFKA: I've tapped into the ultimate power. Observe...!
       Such magnificent power! You are like insects to me!
       I will exterminate everyone, and everything!
(He does all this, throwing two people around)

TERRA: People will keep rebuilding the things you take from them!

KEFKA: Then I'll destroy those too. Why do people rebuild things
       they know are going to be destroyed? Why do people cling
       to life when they know they can't live forever? Think how
       meaningless each of your lives is!
	   
TERRA: It's not the net result of one's life that's important!
       It's the day-to-day concerns, the personal victories, and
       the celebration of life... and love!

      me through it all.

Gogo and Umaro don't say anything

(cue Kefka's theme)
KEFKA: This is sickening... You sound like chapters from a
       self-help booklet! Prepare yourselves!
       Now, for my next trick, I will make you all... disappear!
	   
TERRA: Kefka, you don't know what you're doing! Stop!

    Kefka unleashes the &quot;light of judgement&quot;
	
KEFKA: I command the greatest power in the universe! You
       are all helpless before me!
	   
    Kefka begins the &quot;remodeling&quot; of his tower, making him higher
	
KEFKA: I will destroy everything... I will create
       a monument to non-existence!
	   
    Terra joins him though on a lower height
	   
TERRA: Life will go on! There will always be people, and dreams!

KEFKA: No! I will hunt them down. I will destroy it all!
       Destroy! Destroy! Destroy!
	   
    Locke appears on the other side
	
LOCKE: We will not allow you to harm another living thing.

KEFKA: Hee, hee, hee!! But what fun is destruction if
       no &quot;precious&quot; lives are lost!
	   
    Kefka unleashes the &quot;light of judgement&quot; again, and everything
    looks pretty normal, no crazy towers
	
It's over Kefka!

----------------------------------

Assemble your team

----------------------------------

Kefka's final words...

    KEFKA:
	
        Life... Dreams... Hope...
        Where'd they come from?
        And where are they headed?
        These things, I am going to destroy!!
		
        The end... comes before Chaos...
		
		
----------------------------------

ENTER
    The End
	
	
It's breaking up!

There's no time to lose! Airship's just ahead.

CELES: Come on, everybody! We have to work together!

    Terra walks forward and stumbles. She's morphed by the way
	
CELES: Terra! What's wrong?

    The Magicite begins falling apart
	
The Magicite... Magic is desappearing from this world...

EDGAR: The Espers... They no longer exist...

CELES: You mean Terra too?

TERRA: Come with me. I can lead you out with my
       last ounce of strength.

  They come to a two way option, Setzer flips a coin and
  they start to go in one direction, only for Setzer to

--------------

(Wine glasses)
    Terra as TERRA BRANFORD
	
SCENE
  Same group with no Locke, a Magicite shard floats up from Terra
  
TERRA: Father...?

MADUIN: Terra... we must part now. We Espers will disappear
        from this world... forever. But if the human part of
        you is very strongly attached to someone or something...

--------------

(A paintbrush)

SCENE

CELES: Terra! Your strength is going!

    They watch Terra transform and fall from the sky
	
    Happy kids jump about
	
Do it right, Katarin!
Gotta hang in there!

    Everyone is flat, assuming a fast stop
	
...for a while longer, just a little longer...

Where's Terra!

    Celes runs around looking
	
CELES: Terra!

TERRA: Thank you Setzer!

SETZER: Didn't I say it before?! This is the world's fastest ship!

--------------------------------------------

Cue credits! Seriously that's the last line of text. If you watch all of the
credits then you see signs of &quot;rebirth&quot; as the world is re-assembled and
looking quite healthy. The last scene involves a neat shot of the Falcon
flying off into the distance. And that my friends, is the text for Final
Fantasy 3/6. I can't imagine who might use this, but thanks for reading.
