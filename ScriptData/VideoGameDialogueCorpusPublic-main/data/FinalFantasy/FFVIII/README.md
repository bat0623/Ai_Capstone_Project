# Final Fantasy VIII

## Source

The source seems to cover the vast majority of the mandatory dialogue, but not the optional dialogue (e.g. for sidequests, or where you can visit areas outside of story prompts).

## Gender Coding
Re-coded Ifrit as male (rather than neutral) - the wiki describes him using male pronouns and as a player I read Ifrit as male (not just in this instalment but throughout the series). 

Notes re Adel's gender from the wiki: 
> "Adel is stated in the English localization to be female, and the word "sorceress" is a gender-exclusive term, however, her physique and unisex name have led to confusion. In Japanese, the term for sorceress, Majo (魔女?) (written with the characters for "magic"/"demon" and "woman") is analogous to the English word "witch". The French version at times refers to Adel as "he". The Italian version gives her the explicitly feminine form of her name "Adele".

> Circumstantial evidence within the game indicates that sorceresses can only be women. All other sorceresses are women, and Adel only searches for girls to be her successor. The Final Fantasy VIII Ultimania posits that sorceresses are women[1], and Kazushige Nojima's short story, Aru Hi no Garden no Jugyō Fūkei, describes the association with Great Hyne's magic and women, and that this is the specific origin of the word Majo (魔女?)." - https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Adel_(Final_Fantasy_VIII)#Gender

Lines attributed to the "Aide" have been separated as its two characters (the same as the aides on the left/right), but they're in spacesuits so it's impossible to tell their gender. 

From context I think the "Panicky Gentleman" is supposed to be Laguna (i.e. the President). That might need to be revisited. 

"Security Guard" is a generic, but I've tried to split them up where it's obvious they refer to different instances. "Soldier" is also a generic. 

"Voice" is sometimes impossible to identify as the game isn't voiced (only text-based) and there aren't always visual clues. Where there are I've handled with aliases. 

During the first Laguna sequence, the characters that mentally time travel (Squall, Zell and Selphie) are listed as "SeeD" in the source because their dialogue is not explicitly labelled in this form. However, one can often infer which character is speaking, so I've added aliases accordingly. These are 'best guesses'. 

It's very difficult to tell from the top-down limited view how best to code the Squad C Leader and there's no info in the wiki, so coding as neutral. The same is true for "Researcher".
