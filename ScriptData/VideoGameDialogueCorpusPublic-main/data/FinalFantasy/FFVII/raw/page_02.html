<p class="italic"><a name="arrival"></a>The train pulls into the Sector 7 station, and its passengers get off.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Yo!! Get over here, all'ya!!</p>
<p class="italic">If Cloud tries to run off...</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Yo, Cloud! You lissen up!</p>
<p class="italic">The others group around Barret by the steps down from the platform.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>This mission was a success. But don't get lazy now.<br/>The hard part's still to come! Don't y'all be scared of that explosion!<br/>Cause the next one's gonna be bigger than that!<br/>Meet back at the hideout!! Move out!</p>
<p class="italic">Barret runs off, and Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie follow him.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Station Man</b><br/>When you've been a train man as long as I have, you see a lot of people and a lot of lives.<br/>People meeting, parting, joy, sadness... After a while, it doesn't even get to you anymore.<br/>I wonder how long it's been... There's an invisible rail between me and the passengers.<br/>I could never live their lives. I'm just a train man plain and simple. It's easier that way.<br/>That's not to say that the crossing gate of my heart doesn't hurt now and again.<br/>Back during the war, I remember there was a lot of painful scenes then.<br/>But, that's a story for another day...<br/>First train leaves Midgar at 05:04am.</p>
<p class="italic"><a name="exploring"></a>A red-haired couple are standing by the street lamp.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Guy</b><br/>I'm not letting you go tonight.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Girl</b><br/>Wow!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Guy</b><br/>Isn't there somewhere we could go to be alone?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Girl</b><br/>Wow!<br/>There's only the train graveyard around here. And they say there's ghosts around too!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Guy</b><br/>......damn.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Girl</b><br/>What?</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud leaves the train station and walks through the sector.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man by Fence</b><br/>Hey now!! Oops!!<br/>What on earth are you doing? Just butt out......geez!<br/>Huh? You came to see it, too?<br/>There was a bombing on top. If this pillar should come down, everyone in the slums is dust...<br/>Well, there's no point in worryin' about that.<br/>Hey!! Look! It's huge, ain't it?</p>
<p class="italic">Cloud looks up at the support pillar with him.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Man by Fence</b><br/>Hey... This is a strange and wonderful place.<br/>This is my place, but you can come here when you want. Bye, bro!</p>
<p class="italic-inline">He runs off.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Yo, Cloud! Over here, now!</p>
<p class="italic">Of course, you can ignore him if you want. Some distance from the fence are two soldiers guarding an exit.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldier 1</b><br/>What the hell do you want? You know who I am?<br/>You can't pass. I got the miserable job of keepin' scum like you from trying to sneak in here.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldier 2</b><br/>W, wow! You're great!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldier 1</b><br/>Damn right!! Don't waste time talkin's, what I always say!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldier 2</b><br/>But, uh, I......<br/>Ah... eh... uhm............ Excuse me. You cannot pass without the proper clearance.<br/>Did I do good this time?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldier 1</b><br/>You gotta be tougher!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Soldier 2</b><br/>But, uh, I......</p>
<p class="italic">As Cloud approaches 7th Heaven, Barret and the others charge into the bar. Gunfire is heard, and a number of customers run out. Tifa comes out after them and bows apologetically. All the AVALANCHE members go inside but Barret, who waits impatiently by the entrance.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Barret</b><br/>Heh heh...<br/>You wanna meet your little baby?</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>- Little baby?<br/>- Out of my way!</p>

A lotta innocent people got killed too!<br/>If the explosion had been in the middle of the night, that woulda been one thing. At least the people coulda gone in their sleep.<br/>This Mako explosion has really sent Midgar into a fit.</p>

  <p class="italic">A tutorial begins.</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Sure, I'll explain how Materia works.<br/>First, access the menu.<br/>You know the basic functions.<br/>The triangle button brings up the menu.<br/>Directional buttons move the cursor,<br/>like this.<br/>Select each menu by using the OK button.<br/>If you want to leave the menu,<br/>just push the CANCEL button.<br/>See? Let's go ahead.<br/>Now you're in this menu.<br/>Select [Materia] sub menu.<br/>Select who you want to use it.<br/>Now look at my weapon here.<br/>Each weapon and armor has slots in it.<br/>Choose which slot you want to put Materia in.<br/>Now select the Materia you want to use.<br/>This is curative Materia.<br/>If you want to know what its effect is,<br/>line the cursor up with [Check],<br/>and push the OK button.<br/>It's just like selecting battle commands.<br/>Just line the cursor up to [Magic],<br/>you can see that the available magic has increased.<br/>Now you can use new magic [Cure].<br/>And that's all there is to equipping Materia.<br/>See? It wasn't that tough!<br/>When you want to remove any Materia,<br/>it's as easy as pointing to the materia slot,<br/>and pushing the triangle button.<br/>There's just one thing you have to be careful of.<br/>Whenever you equip Materia,<br/>your situation changes.<br/>Parts of you may become stronger...<br/>while others get weaker.<br/>Normally, when you equip [Magic] Materia,<br/>your magic power will get stronger.<br/>But your physical strength weakens.<br/>So, Materia's kind of a double-edged sword.<br/>On the left side of the screen,<br/>you can see the Materia's effect on you.<br/>It's wise not to overuse Magic Materia.<br/>But try out various things.<br/>Push the CANCEL button to exit the sub menu.<br/>Ok, that's about it.<br/>I'll give you some advanced tips later.</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Barret</b><br/>Shi......! What's this 'It wasn't that tough!' crap!<br/>I'm clueless......<br/>Well, you handle the Materia then!</p>

  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Now I'll tell you about saving.<br/>You know what'll happen if you don't save?<br/>That's right.<br/>Everything you worked so hard to do will be lost!<br/>You never know when there might be a power outage.<br/>And you've got a long battle ahead of you.<br/>It pays to save often<br/>and take breaks when you need them.<br/>Anyway you'll need a Memory card to save your games.<br/>But, uh, none of the stores around here sell any.<br/>You'll have to get some at a (real) store.<br/>I guess you already have a Memory card.<br/>Put the Card firmly into the slot.<br/>Put it in either the right or left side.<br/>Then when you're ready, access the menu.<br/>Select [Save].<br/>Remember you can't just save wherever you want.<br/>You can only save at places marked [Save Point].<br/>When you find one, a message will appear.<br/>Whenever you reach a [Save Point],<br/>you'll want to save your game.<br/>Slot 1 is on the left,<br/>slot 2 on the right. Choose either one.<br/>Next, choose your file and save it.<br/>Each Memory card can hold up to 15 files.<br/>If you have files from other games on it,<br/>there will be less room to save.<br/>The screen only shows 3 files at a time so,<br/>press the directional buttons to scroll down the list,<br/>and you can see the rest.<br/>Remember, the more files you have,<br/>the longer it will take to load.<br/>One last thing.<br/>The Memory card is a delicate device.<br/>Be careful when handling it.<br/>Never remove it while saving or loading.<br/>Don't get mad even if you lose.<br/>If that happens, just chill out,<br/>and let your head, and your console, cool down.<br/>That's all.<br/>Remember to save often so you don't lose your games.</p>

  <p class="italic">If you don't have any Potions in your inventory:</p>

  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Ghost</b><br/>Man, ex-SOLDIER's sure are cheap. OK, I'll GIVE you a Potion...</p>
  <p class="italic">Cloud will then begin his explanation:</p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>You probably already know this but...<br/>HP is your life force.<br/>If HP is lost in battle, you're out of commission.<br/>MP is the source of your magic power.<br/>If your MP's lost, you'll be unable to cast spells.<br/>So, what should we do to cure a damaged ally?<br/>There are three ways.<br/>First, you can rest at an inn at a nearby town.<br/>Second, you can use items to help them recover.<br/>Third, you can use curative magic.<br/>I'll explain about Magic later,<br/>but here we'll talk about items.<br/>Select [Item] from the menu.<br/>Potion restores HP.<br/>If you can't find where Potion is,<br/>access the menu and select [Arrange]<br/>to change the order of items.<br/>You can arrange them however you like.<br/>Order items you'll use in the field.<br/>Order items you'll use in battle.<br/>Prioritize items you can throw in battle.<br/>Order weapons and armor separately.<br/>Order by name<br/>Order by most items held<br/>Order by least items held<br/>By the way,<br/>[Key Items]'s are just that,<br/>items that unlock problems just like a key.<br/>They're very important items to have.<br/>Keep that in mind.<br/>Ok, now select [Use],<br/>Then select [Potion].<br/>Select the person you want to use it on.<br/>If they're already maxed out,<br/>you won't be able to use it on them.<br/>We can restore MP with [Ether].<br/>You use this the same way you did for [Potion].<br/>Just pick a member and use it!<br/>The number appearing next to the item name<br/>tells you how many are available.<br/>Of course, the more you use, the less you'll have.<br/>Some enemies will drop Potions or Ethers,<br/>but you'll want to stock up whenever you're at a store.<br/>One last thing, if someone in your party gets wiped out,<br/>either rest at an inn or use [Phoenix Down].<br/>That's all!</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
  <p><span class="highlight">Curative Magic?</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Now I'll tell you how to use curative magic.<br/>First, access the menu and select [Magic].<br/>Next, select who'll cast the spell.<br/>Pick an ally equipped with [Restore] Materia.<br/>You can select another party member<br/>by using the L1 and R1 buttons.<br/>The function also work in other sub menus.<br/>Better remember that.<br/>This is magic you can use,<br/>monsters you can summon,<br/>and enemy techniques you've learned.<br/>Whenever [Magic] is selected...<br/>the available magic appears on the screen...<br/>So, if you wanted to use [Cure]...<br/>you would select it from the menu...<br/>then select who you want to use it on.<br/>I think Potion is pretty expensive, so...<br/>when you're near an inn and you can restore MP,<br/>it's better to use curative magic rather than Potion.<br/>That's all.</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
  <p><span class="highlight">Weapons and armor?</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Equipping weapons & armor is basic to battle.<br/>Let me show you how it's done.<br/>Just finding or buying new weapons or armor,<br/>isn't enough.<br/>You have to access the menu and select [Equip].<br/>Then, select who you want to equip.<br/>You can change weapons,<br/>armor<br/>and accessories.<br/>Accessories have special effects.<br/>Just select what you want to change.<br/>On the right side of the screen,<br/>here's a list of what can be equipped.<br/>You can see the item's effect here.<br/>Change your weapon with the OK button.<br/>Make sure it'll increase attack/defense levels.<br/>Pay special attention to Materia slots.<br/>The slots that are linked are effective.<br/>Also check the growth rates of Materia.<br/>Now when you want to remove an accessory...<br/>press the triangle button here.<br/>You should never remove weapons or armor.<br/>Because you never know when you'll be attacked.<br/>After you're finished equipping,<br/>you should re-equip your Materia.<br/>That's it!</p>

<div class="block">
  <p><span class="highlight">How to apply Materia?</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Materia can unleash hidden power in humans.<br/>So let's see how Materia is used.<br/>First, access the menu.<br/>Then select [Materia].<br/>Select who you want to use it.<br/>Pay close attention to my weapon here.<br/>Each weapon and armor has slots in them.<br/>Choose which slot you want to put Materia in.<br/>Now select the Materia you want to use.<br/>This is curative Materia.<br/>If you want to know what its effect is,<br/>line the cursor up with [Check],<br/>and push the OK button.<br/>It's just like selecting battle commands.<br/>Just line the cursor up to [magic],<br/>you can see that the available magic has increased.<br/>Now you can use new magic [Cure].<br/>And that's all there is to equipping Materia.<br/>See? It wasn't that tough!<br/>When you want to remove Materia,<br/>it's as easy as pointing to the materia slot,<br/>and pushing the triangle button.<br/>There's only one thing you have to watch out for.<br/>When you equip Materia, your condition changes.<br/>Parts of you will become stronger...<br/>while others get weaker.<br/>Normally, when you equip [Magic] Materia,<br/>your magic power will get stronger.<br/>But your physical strength weakens.<br/>So, Materia's kind of a double-edged sword.<br/>The left side of the screen,<br/>shows the effect of the Materia.<br/>Try out everything.<br/>And that's all.<br/>I'll tell you about some of the finer points next.</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
  <p><span class="highlight">Effective ways to use Materia?</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Access the menu if you find Materia.<br/>There's a lot of different Materia around.<br/>This is one of them. It's [All] Materia.<br/>If you equip this alone, nothing will happen.<br/>It's a little tricky, but I'll tell you anyway.<br/>Now look at my weapon.<br/>Look closely at those two slots.<br/>They're joined together as linked slots.<br/>You've got to remember to put it into linked slots.<br/>Different Materia will affect each other.<br/>But only if the slots are linked.<br/>Just to show you,<br/>let's put some [All] into one of the slots,<br/>and [Lightning] in the other.<br/>Now we can use [Bolt] on [All] the enemies.<br/>But it's limited to once per battle.<br/>Combine different things<br/>and you'll come up with different results.<br/>Combining [Restore] and [All],<br/>will let you use [Cure] for your entire party.<br/>There are also many useless combinations.<br/>For example, [Restore] and [Lightning]<br/>[Bolt] and [Cure] can be used normally, but<br/>there won't be any compound effect.<br/>Specialized Materia like [All] is called [Support Materia].<br/>You can tell the difference<br/>just by looking at the Materia's color.<br/>This may sound weird, but<br/>did you know Materia grows on its own?<br/>Even if one of your allies uses it,<br/>it will continue to grow with each battle.<br/>As its level increases,<br/>so will the effects of the magic you can use.<br/>I told you [All] works once per battle.<br/>But it can work twice or more as it grows.<br/>When you get it to the master leve,<br/>Materia will divide itself, looking like it's giving birth.<br/>But that master Materia won't grow anymore.<br/>When you can't take Materia on anymore,<br/>you'd better sell it or dump it somewhere.<br/>You can see the useful functions here.<br/>You can [Arange] Materia,<br/>[Remove all] Materia from your weapon.<br/>You can throw Materia into the [Trash].<br/>Oops, relax! I wasn't gonna dump it.<br/>Let's see. This is a special menu for you.<br/>You can exchange all Materia you have between allies,<br/>even if they're not in your party.<br/>Now about Materia's growth.<br/>The growth rate depends on<br/>what weapon or armor it's put into.<br/>Some will double in growth, while others won't grow at all.<br/>In most cases, the Materia's effect won't change<br/>whether you put it into a weapon or armor.<br/>But [Elemental] and [Added Effect]<br/>are completely different depending on whether<br/>they're put into weapons or armor.<br/>You've got to think about<br/>what weapon or armor to use, or<br/>what Materia combinations will be the strongest.<br/>I remember hearing once...<br/>about extraordinary Materia somewhere in the world.<br/>I think I've told you just about everything I can.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Boy</b><br/>......smack......knock......!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Girl</b><br/>Help!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>You've got to hang in there. You're limit gauge is just starting to build.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Girl</b><br/>Waaaah!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Ok! Now your limit gauge is full, go ahead and use it! Fight with your limit technique.</p>
<p class="italic">The girl starts glowing and pummels the boy, knocking him down.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Great!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Boy</b><br/>Magic!! Magic!!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Girl</b><br/>Help!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Calm down! When your enemy uses magic counter with [Magic Barrier] or [reflect].<br/>[Magic Barrier] reduces the damage received from magic by half.<br/>[reflect] bounces the attacks off you. But the number of times you can use it is limited so be careful.</p>
<p class="italic">The girl uses reflect and knocks down the boy.</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Great!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Boy</b><br/>Wow! You sure are strong! I'm going to be strong, too!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Girl</b><br/>Me too!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>If you want to get as strong as me you need to use Materia.<br/>And you have to find the best combinations of them.<br/>The type of Materia you put in your weapons and armor will determine how quickly your Materia grows.<br/>Put Materia into the open slots in your weapons and armor. The possible combinations are limitless.<br/>That's about all I can tell you. If you want to be like me, you have to have some natural talent.</p>

<p class="indent"><b>Three Guys Posing</b><br/>Hey SOLDIER!! Tell us about battles! We'll even pay you!</p>
<p class="indent"><b>Cloud</b><br/>I'm not hard up enough to take money from guys like you. But I'll rap with you for a while.<br/>What do you want to know?<br/>- About ATB<br/>- The numbers on the screen<br/>- About [change] and [defend]<br/>- About [Escape]<br/>- About the gauges<br/>- About [status]<br/>- About [elementals]<br/>- About [help]<br/>- That's all the time I have for you!</p>
<div class="block">
  <p><span class="highlight">About ATB</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>ATB or Active Time Battle is a system that is always in operation during battle.<br/>Select [Wait] from ATB on the Config Menu and time will stop when you select magic or items during battle.<br/>This gives you time to pick out your commands. This is especially helpful to beginners.<br/>Selecting [Recommended] ATB in the config menu can stop time while the effects of spells and items are taking place during battle.<br/>This lets you take your time looking over the progression of the battle. When you don't want to rush in battle, this is for you!<br/>Personally, I always use [Active], but you can use whichever you like.</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
  <p><span class="highlight">The numbers on the screen</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>White numbers appearing on the screen in battle are damage points. Green numbers show restorative points.<br/>You better watch these if you don't want to get wiped out.</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
  <p><span class="highlight">About [change] and [defend]</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>The [change] command can move characters to and from the front and back rows.<br/>In the back row, the damage received is less, but the attacking power is less.<br/>You can make a [change] by pressing the Directional button in battle.<br/>Pushing the Directional button the other direction during battle accesses [defend].<br/>Selecting [defend] reduces the damage you receive by half until the next command.<br/>If you're up against a strong enemy, Don't hesitate to use this one. Of course, I never need it.</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
  <p><span class="highlight">About [Escape]</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>I don't really remember ever having to use the [escape] command... but you'll probably need it.<br/>Push the L1 and R1 buttons at the same time, holding them down, and you can escape.</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
  <p><span class="highlight">About the gauges</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>During battle, there are several [gauges] displayed. You can't check them now, so just remember what I tell you.<br/>[time gauge] displays the time remaining until your next turn while in battle.<br/>When the gauge is full, you can make your command.<br/>If you don't want to make one, push the △ button and you can move to the next character.<br/>It's convenient when you wanna make Barret work.<br/>The [limit gauge] increases every time you sustain damage. When it is full, you can use the [limit technique].<br/>The gauge is not cleared after each battle, but gradually builds up over time.<br/>It takes a while for it to build up, so you have to think about which times are the best to use it.<br/>You probably don't know about it, but there are conditions of [status], [fury], and [sadness].<br/>When you have [fury], your limit gauge builds up sooner, but your attacking accuracy is lower.<br/>Keep in mind that [sadness] makes your limit gauge build up slower, but the damage you receive is also lessened.<br/>[barrier gauge] is for specialized magic.<br/>The top gauge displays [barrier] or magic defense against attacks. The bottom gauge displays [magic barrier] or defenses against magic attacks.<br/>Both will cut the damage you receive in half. However, over time they will disappear.<br/>Whenever you use [barrier] or [magic barrier] make sure to pay attention to the [barrier gauge].<br/>That's it. Remember that for the next battle.</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
  <p><span class="highlight">About [status]</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>[status] means just that. The status of each character.<br/>I'll probably wind up repeating myself, but let me go over a few basic points.<br/>Sleep<br/>You cannot put in a command until you get up.<br/>Poison<br/>Steals your HP in battle.<br/>Fury<br/>Damage is increased, attack accuracy decreased. Tranquilizers will remedy it.<br/>Sadness<br/>Damage is decreased. Hyper will remedy it.<br/>Petrify<br/>Will petrify and become immobilized. Every member will be wiped out.<br/>Confuse<br/>Will attack enemy and ally alike.<br/>Silence<br/>Will be unable to cast magic.<br/>Paralyze<br/>Stops time gauges, commands.<br/>Darkness<br/>Accuracy of hitting attacks decreases.<br/>Frog<br/>Become a frog. I hate this one!<br/>Hoo... I'm beat.<br/>[status change], since this can be changed with magic and items, you should check it whenever you buy things.</p>
</div>
<div class="block">
  <p><span class="highlight">About [elementals]</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>[elemental] is the special effect that comes with certain weapons and magic.<br/>It's necessary to move ahead effectively. If you pay attention to the types of elementals you use you'll become intermediate in no time.<br/>I put together this list, but remember, it's just a partial list don't take it too literally.<br/>Fire<br/>Fire effect. Works best on animals and water monsters.<br/>Ice<br/>Ice effect. Works best on fire monsters and things that hate the cold.<br/>Lightning<br/>Lightning effect. Works best on mechanical things.<br/>Earth<br/>Attacks using the earth's power. Doesn't work on flying enemies.<br/>Poison<br/>Poisons enemies. Doesn't work on any poison based enemies.<br/>Gravity<br/>Gravity based attack. These hurt if they hit.<br/>Water<br/>Calls on the earth's water. Works well on fire monsters.<br/>Wind<br/>Calls up the winds. Works well on flying enemies.<br/>Holy<br/>Calls up the Planet's power. Works well on dark monsters.<br/>If you use reciprocal elementals in your attacks, the effect is huge!<br/>Also, if you use the same elemental, your defenses are raised. But, you have to be careful because the opposite is also true.<br/>To see what elementals an enemy has, you need [Sense] Materia. If you get that Materia, you should try using it.</p>

  <p><span class="highlight">About [help]</span></p>
  <p class="indent-nopad"><b>Cloud</b><br/>Looks like you didn't get it the last time I told you. What's wrong with you? You touched in the head?<br/>Well, don't worry. You just need to push the [SELECT] button in battle.<br/>Do that, and the [help message] will walk you through the commands.<br/>It also shows you the name of your enemy, so even I use it once in a while.

<p class="indent"><b>Woman by Save Point</b><br/>This is the fabled [Save Point]!!<br/>At a [Save Point] you can use a [tent] and/or select "SAVE".<br/>There's more, too. Look for something called secret.<br/>Even if you are wiped out, if you save you can restart from that same point.<br/>That way you don't have to worry when you've been wiped out.<br/>This is jumping ahead a little but, when you leave Midgar...<br/>Once you get the world map, you can save anywhere you like. Remember that.</p>
