# Final Fantasy VII

## Gender coding

Update: 
I've changed the coding for "Beautiful Bro" from neutral to male. The wiki describes him as a cross-dressing man (thus the female character model), and in the script when Cloud is planning on dressing as a woman it's suggested to he go to the gym ('Men's Hall') to find a wig as there are other people "like" him there (i.e. who are cross-dressing). However there is debate online as to whether Beautiful Bro should be interpreted as trans. In the remake the character is replaced with Jules, who is described in the wiki as an "effeminate man". Jules is gender non-conforming, and possibly FTM trans or non-binary. This decision isn't straightforward, so may have to be revisited. 

There's a lot of dicsussion amongst the fans about who the "Voice in Cloud's head" is, with consensus being that it's pre-trauma Cloud. The original coding had it as a separate character, and since that's the in-game experience of the player, I've left it like that - but again this may need to be revisited. 

I don't know who says {"????": "Kiiiiin..."}. It appears in this video (different English translation as "....rrrrrring"): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKLL0TPYLNs, but still is unhelpful. I've left as "????" and coded as neutral. 

"Cat kid" is described as a boy here: http://letao.is-a-geek.net/ff7script/wall-market.html. From this and other sources it looks like you don't see the "Cook" - that their dialogue triggers when you attempt to answer the question? I wasn't sure (coded neutral). "Customer" is described as a "guy" browsing clothes on a rack. 

With both "Couple" and "Couple 2", it seems it's unclear which of them is talking. So I've coded as neutral. 

"Gossip" uses the same sprite as Big Bro (see 52:15 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_81whPVndc). The wiki notes that Big Bro (Beautiful Bro in our script) "uses female character model" (https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII_characters#Big_Bro-desc). I've coded as female based on the character model (and note this is in keeping with various stereotypes: "Gossip" is a term for women, and the character is accompanied by a child.)

Confidence with all the various shopkeeper NPCs (including innkeepers) isn't super high: they're based on stills or low quality videos of gameplay (and sometimes contextual info from http://letao.is-a-geek.net/ff7script/), and in some cases working out who is who is guesswork based on context. "Accessory Shopkeeper" is the one from Gongaga. I've split out the dialogue of the Junon one. It's hard to be sure because of the angle at which you view them (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYvd4F_hLAM 11:39), but the sprite looks like it might be female, so I've coded accordingly. 

"Kid" denotes several different people - have coded with aliases to try to ensure the gender balance is right (I haven't done the same for girl/boy), although it seems that they are all male. As best I can tell, "redhead" is a particular male NPC sprite that is reused. 

"Letter" denotes two letters. I've added aliases to match the people the letters are from (Hojo and Johnny). 

Couldn't track down "Person in Bathroom". Coded as neutral. I think the "Ghost Square Receptionist" is the same character model (or indeed the same character) as "Semusi" in the wiki, but I wasn't sure of their gender either so coded neutral. Likewise for "Zombie". I think "Security" are robots, so coded neutral. 

"Shopper" is named "Crazed Consumer" in the wiki. Coded female. 

I couldn't track down a video with "Train worker", so coded neutral. 

I think "Black Surfer" and "White Surfer" are the same as "Surfer 1" and "Surfer 2" so I've added those aliases. 



---------------------------------------------------------------------
"TV Producer" and "AD" are only experienced as voices, we never see them.

Chekhov is referred to as "she" in the wiki: https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Chekhov
"Gorky" is referred to as "he"
"Choco Bill" and "Choco Billy" are two separate people.


"EDK" is the Evil Dragon King in the play at Event Square.

A dormant Jenova appears as a gray-skinned woman (shown as blue-skinned in Final Fantasy VII, or only appearing blue through its container in the mako reactor on Mt. Nibel in other games). Although Jenova appears feminine its gender is ambiguous, being an extra-terrestrial lifeform whom the Cetra never refer to with a feminine pronoun; Jenova is known as the "calamity from the skies" in the legends, and in Final Fantasy VII Ifalna refers to Jenova as either "it" or "he" depending on the version of the game.


TODO: "Girl" and "Boy" appear several times but are different characters? need to split up.

Based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdSx6ltGEEo:
Materia Shopkeeper: Not easy to tell gender.

Weapons shop person is referred to as "he"

"Beautiful Bro": complains about losing weight, appears to be wearing either shorts or a skirt. Hard to tell gender.

"Redhead in Suit": Part of Don Corneo's gang, who are otherwise men. Dressed as

"Mechanics" in rocket town are here: https://youtu.be/2CGDWhTDTU0?t=449


Wall market diner waitress, there are few gender signifiers. Maybe the character model is a generic female, but it's hard to tell:

## Extra dialogue 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPAzyQPMVWA

"Crew Member 4": "Sorry!! Go speak to captain Jezereth"

"Chocobo Crew Member": I'm bored, I'd like to ride a Chocobo"
	Tifa: How do I?
		"Chocobo Crew Member": Listen ... you gotta ride in on a Chocobo you've raised yourself. Then, if you bring your Chocobo to this stable, I'll take care of it for you. What? How do you raise a Chocobo? Can't say I know much about that. If you want to know about raising Chocobo, there's a Chocobo ranch near Midgar. You should ask them"
	Tifa: Later
