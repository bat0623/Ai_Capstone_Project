This is why Cloud's narration tends to trail off and get murky throughout the flashback like he has trouble remembering much beyond a few incidental scenes.

Note also that Zack's hairstyle was actually based on an early design for Cloud's that was changed because it wasn't striking enough - Cloud is the main character, while Zack is a backstory character whose entire existence is obscured from the player, with the ironic concept that he's a more 'main character'-type person than Cloud.

Accordingly, the protagonists are a plucky band of eco-terrorists doing their utmost to sabotage Shinra's businesses.

-   To Zack. His quest to become a hero contrasts with the same quest Genesis Rhapsodos undertakes, but whereas the latter's feelings of entitlement to the moniker of ""hero"" lead to obsession and downfall, Zack's quest to ""become a hero"" has less to do with personal glory and more with making the world a better place. Zack's will to become a hero motivated him to think for himself and to be guided by his moral compass and sense of justice, whereas Genesis's obsession with becoming a hero drove him to challenge those he saw as hindrances and a need to prove himself as superior to others. Both joined SOLDIER inspired by stories of the hero First Class Sephiroth, striving to emulate him, and both fall from Shinra's graces after learning of the company's corrupt ways. In an inversion of a typical hero-villain story dynamic, Zack dies whereas Genesis lives.
-   To Angeal as well. They are both SOLDIERs of Project G, both were inspired by Sephiroth to join SOLDIER and both can create copies of themselves. However Genesis and his copies are associated with black wings, whereas Angeal and his copies are associated with white wings, alluding to angel/fallen angel imagery.

Even their designs play into this; Genesis is short-haired, right-handed, has a wing on his left side, and wields a massive straight-bladed sword that he infuses with magic, while Sephiroth is long-haired, [left-handed](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeftHandedMirror), with a wing on the right side, and he wields a katana that he never empowers.

-   The second is when Zack defeats him during the [Final Boss](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss) battle.

-   As a SOLDIER, he's a normal human that has been injected with Jenova's cells. However they manifest differently in him than in Sephiroth due to the different nature of how they received the cells, which is the major reason for his rebellion against Shinra; Genesis' genes are unstable and when he's injured in a sparring match, his body begins to undergo cellular degradation. This first shows itself when he manifests a black wing, but as the game goes on and his condition worsens, his hair lightens to white, and his skin begins to crack and scar.
-   The Genesis Copies created by grafting his cells onto humans take on his facial appearance and hair, but they also experience the same degradation he does at an accelerated rate. The result is that while a few of them look identical to Genesis, others look even more monstrous than he does to the point they're barely recognizable as human anymore, such as the [G-Warrior strains<img height=""12"" src=""https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif"" style=""border:none;"" width=""12""/>](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/File:G_Devastator_Artwork.jpg)<small>◊</small>.

-   More literally, while Genesis isn't the cause behind all of major problems in the world of *Final Fantasy VII* (that can be laid on Hojo's hands), he *did* instigate Sephiroth's loss of sanity in Nibelheim, and thus is partially to blame for Sephiroth becoming such a major threat to the planet in *VII* and later works. His name also implies that he was the first SOLDIER to be injected with Jenova cells, which would lead to Sephiroth being the perfection of it.

../data/FinalFantasy/FFVII/,Final Fantasy VII,Sephiroth,Sephiroth,Depending on the Writer,0," [Depending on the Writer](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter): His depictions vary wildly.<ul>
-   *Final Fantasy VII* depicted him as obsessed with his mother and wanting to become a god in her name; *Advent Children* has invoked [Flanderization](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization) as described below, with him focusing on his rivalry and hatred for Cloud; *Crisis Core* explores his pre-madness [Sugar and Ice](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarAndIce) personality where he's a nice guy who is just tough to get to know; *Kingdom Hearts* retools him as Cloud's [Enemy Without](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout) existing to [Troll](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll) him and goad him into fighting; *Dissidia* sees him as a [Punch-Clock Villain](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain) interested only in recovering his memories with no loyalty to Chaos or Cosmos otherwise. Depending on the game you pick up, Sephiroth can be a mass-murdering sociopath, a respectful [Worthy Opponent](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent), a delusional man with a God Complex, or some combination of them all.
-   His power levels also fluctuate, mostly to keep him balanced against other characters in each game. He may be an [Empowered Badass Normal](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpoweredBadassNormal) master swordsman, or he may have god-like top-tier magical abilities.
-   Numerous materials and creator statements vary on if Sephiroth is [The Chessmaster](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster) or [The Pawn](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePawn) to Jenova. Mostly it's implied Sephiroth [assumed complete control of her](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackingCthulhu), but it's also heavily implied that some of her nature and instincts began influencing him in return, and some creation materials say that it was Jenova controlling him and not the other way around.
-   His first death also varies between media. *Crisis Core* and *Final Fantasy VII* show that Cloud managed to use [Heroic Willpower](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower) and Sephiroth's injured state to his advantage and throw him into the Lifestream. <img class=""trivia1 rounded"" src=""/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png"" title=""This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

-   He's initially presented as one to Cloud, being his former partner and an ex-SOLDIER who went rogue.

Also, Aerith was a child of love between Prof. Gast and Ifalna, while Sephiroth was the loveless child of  (SPOILER)  Hojo and Lucrecia , meant to be an experiment. Both of them grew up in not exactly healthy environments, and all their lives, they both wanted to reject their obviously unnatural natures, simply wanting to be normal, until, eventually, they had to face what they were. But while Aerith's acceptance of her Cetra nature made her willing to save the world, even at the cost of her life, Sephiroth decided to exterminate everyone else and the Planet, and install himself as a being above all others. The novella ""Case of the Lifestream"" notes that in the events leading up to *Advent Children*, Aerith considered creating her own avatars on the surface to help fight Kadaj, Loz, and Yazoo, but decided it was more important to contact Cloud herself and let him handle it.

-   After the party is imprisoned by Shinra, Sephiroth makes his first appearance by going on a massive killing spree inside the compound where you are imprisoned, leaving a trail of Shinra mook corpses as well as the Shinra president's body with a sword in his back. Of course, since just before this, President Shinra had arranged for Sector 7 to be destroyed, with the people both on the plate and in the slums, still inside all for the sake of wiping out AVALANCHE, it's hard to feel any sympathy for him. In fact, when they discover the President's body and discover who killed him, Barret's immediate response is to ask, ""So Sephiroth is a good guy?""

He was capable of forming genuine attachments and developing respect for others, was open to helping others and was rather reasonable and polite. But once he discovers his origins, Sephiroth's personality is completely twisted, the first sign of his sociopathy manifesting with a newfound desire for bloodshed and an extreme obsession with his mother figure, JENOVA. By the events of the main game, Sephiroth is most commonly associated with an incredibly cold, antisocial demeanor that always persists whenever he's in anyone's presence. His monologue after killing Aerith is one where he doesn't care about feelings and emotions and is completely unmoved and unfazed by anything in his desire to destroy the world for his own ends.

Not only that, but even after proving himself as a highly revered individual in SOLDIER, it forced him into conflict with some of the only people he was ever able to make friends with, and he lost all of them one way or another.
