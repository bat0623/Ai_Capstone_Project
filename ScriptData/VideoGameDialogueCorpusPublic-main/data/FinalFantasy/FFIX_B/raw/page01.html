===========================================================
NOTATION INFORMATION
===========================================================

(PF) =    Pointer finger. Substituted in place of a picture.

{  /  } = Options in the weird brackets mean no dialogue
          is said by picking either option, so I'm not
          going to list them like usual. One usually sees
          these when talking to shopkeepers and moogles.
          An example would look like &quot;{Yes/No}&quot;.

(note)    Means there's a song note symbol in the dialogue.
          Shown only when someone's singing, of course.

([])      My attempt at portraying the Square button.

(/\)      My attempt at portraying the Triangle button.

(&gt;&lt;)      My attempt at the X button, but only because I
          thought they would all look better as 4-character
          symbols (for semblance). I'll probably end up
          changing this...

(O)       Denotes the O button. 

===========================================================
NOTATION INFORMATION, PART II
===========================================================

Normal dialogue is single-spaced to show that there is more
than one different speaker, like this example:

Zidane: &quot;Hey!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;What's crackin'?&quot;

In other places, dialogue will be compacted without that
single-spaced portion, which denotes that it's either text
said in unison, like this similar example:

Zidane: &quot;Hey!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;What's crackin'?&quot;
Steiner: &quot;You startled me!&quot;

In addition to that context, NPC dialogue may have compact
dialogue to show that the speaker says something new after
the initial talk, like this example:

Soldier: &quot;Sure is hot out here!&quot;
Soldier: &quot;I wish it'd rain...&quot;

There are few times when it's hard to tell which 'tense' is
being used, so the reader can probably figure it out. ;)

===========================================================
01. Alexandria (AL01)
===========================================================

[As the game starts, the player sees a boy with a tail walk
into a dark room on a ship, looking around.]

??????: &quot;Sure is dark... Guess nobody's here yet...&quot;

[The boy with a tail lights the candle in the room's center.
Someone yells from behind a door immediately, and the player
can name the character. Zidane is the default.]

Voice: &quot;Who's there!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It's me, Zidane!&quot;

[Three guys run out: one with red hair, one with a bandanna,
and one carrying a hammer. The former speaks.]

Blank: &quot;Hey, Zidane! You sure are late!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Sorry. So, where's the boss?&quot;

[The man with the hammer speaks.]

Cinna: &quot;Ain't here yet.&quot;

[Just then, a guy with a dragon's head jumps down from the
stairway and attacks the party. They attack it and the dragon
head eventually pops off, revealing a bearded guy.

Bearded Guy: &quot;UGHUUA! Oh, my head! Go easy, you guys!&quot;

[Everyone's tired from the battle. The Bearded Man is addressed
as Baku.]

Blank: &quot;Whew!&quot;
Cinna: &quot;Whew!&quot;
Marcus: &quot;Whew!&quot;
Zidane: &quot;Whew!&quot;

Baku: &quot;Hey, fools! You're lookin' a lot better! Gwahahaha!
      Alright! Let's start this meeting already!&quot;

[They all hurry into the room next door.]

Baku: &quot;Here's the plan! Tantalus, the infamous band of daring thieves
      (that's us) is headin' to the Kingdom of Alexandria... Our
      mission: to kidnap the heir to the throne, Princess Garnet!&quot;

Cinna: &quot;I'll take it from here, so listen up! Our ship's about to
       dock at Alexandria... And when it does, we're gonna put on
       our costumes... ...and perform 'I want to Be Your Canary,'
       the most popular play in Alexandria! Break a leg, Marcus!
       'Cause you're playin' the lead!&quot;

[The man with the bandanna stands up.]

Marcus: &quot;Leave the actin' to me! Of course, the real kidnappers'll
        be Blank and Zidane!&quot;

Blank: &quot;I'll distract the audience from backstage with these little
       buggers. I can't stand oglops... But I'll manage, so don't
       worry about me. And that'll be your cue, Zidane!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Okay!&quot;
        R1 --&gt; That's when I kidnap Queen Brahne, right?
        R2 --&gt; That's when I kidnap Princess Garnet, right?

        R1 (Baku): &quot;You bet! You're gonna kidnap the fat-ass,
                   butt-ugly Queen Br--... What...what'm I
                   sayin'!?&quot;

        R2: &quot;You bet! You're gonna kidnap the most babe-ilicious
            beauty in all of Alexandria, Princess Garnet!&quot;

[The view changes to the town below. A boy in a large hat looks
up as the ship the Tantalus crew is in flies overhead. The ship
docks near the castle, and then the view fixes back to the boy
with a hat. As the crowd runs off, he drops his ticket, and a
little girl comes over to him.]

Girl: &quot;Are you awright? Here! You dwopped your ticket. Bye-bye!&quot;

[The boy runs along, but a rat kid bumps into him.]

Rat Kid: &quot;Owww! Why you--get outta my way!!!

[The boy in the hat runs further into town. There, a penguin-like
man welcomes some nobles on the street.]

Herald: &quot;Honorable nobles of Treno... Castle Alexandria is this way!&quot;

[The herald leads the nobles away and the boy in the hat heads to
the ticketbooth located in the main square.]

Ticketmaster: &quot;Can I help you, son?&quot;

Pointy-Hat Boy: &quot;Uh... Umm...&quot;
                R1 --&gt; Show Ticket
                R2 --&gt; What's showing today?
                 R2a --&gt; What kind of troupe is Tantalus?
                 R2b --&gt; What's 'I Want to Be Your Canary' about?
                R3 --&gt; Tell me about Alexandria!
                 R3a --&gt; Who's Queen Brahne?
                 R3b --&gt; Tell me about Queen Brahne!
                 R3c --&gt; Who's Princess Garnet?
                 R3d --&gt; Tell me about Princess Garnet!
                 R3e --&gt; Is Princess Garnet really that pretty?
                R4 --&gt; Leave

                R1 (Ticketmaster) &quot;What's this? There's something odd about
                                  this ticket... Why, it's another fake!
                                  I've seen so many today.&quot;

                   Pointy-hat Boy: &quot;Nooooo!&quot;

                   Ticketmaster: &quot;Now, now. Don't cry. I know how you must
                                 feel. Here, I'll give you these. Do try to
                                 cheer up now, hmm?&quot; [He gives Vivi some
                                 cards.] Talk to Alleyway Jack to learn more
                                 about Cards. Good luck, lad!&quot;

                R2 (Ticketmaster): &quot;This year's performance is the
                                   masterpiece 'I Want to Be Your
                                   Canary.' The Tantalus Company is
                                   performing.&quot;

                R2a (Ticketmaster): &quot;They're star performers in Lindblum,
                                    the regency to the west, with
                                    accompaniment by Lav Layderce!&quot;

                R2b (Ticketmaster): &quot;This play is a tale of romance between
                                    a noble and a peasant! You really must
                                    see it!&quot;

                R3 (Ticketmaster): &quot;The Kingdom of Alexandria is a fine
                                   country, ruled by Queen Brahne.&quot;

                R3a (Ticketmaster): &quot;Did you know Queen Brahne has a
                                    beautiful daughter, Princess Garnet?&quot;

                R3b (Ticketmaster): &quot;Unfortunately, I've heard strange
                                    things about Queen Brahne recently.&quot;

                R3c (Ticketmaster): &quot;Today is Princess Garnet's sixteenth
                                    birthday, you know!&quot;

                R3d (Ticketmaster): &quot;Her Highness is a beautiful princess,
                                    and everyone in Alexandria loves her!&quot;

                R3e (Ticketmaster): &quot;Why, she's the most beautiful princess
                                    in the history of Alexandria!&quot;

                R4: [The Pointy-hat boy leaves.]

[After finding out his ticket's a fake, the Pointy-hat Boy walks into
the alley near the square. He trips and faceplants, making Dante the
Signmaker mess up.]

Dante the Signmaker: &quot;Blast it! Hey! You made me miss, you little klutz!
                     Whew. That should do it. Well, it's been a long day.&quot;

[Dante walks off but the rat kid from before comes over.]

Rat Kid: &quot;Hey, you! Shrimp! You're the one with the phony ticket, ain'tcha?
         I saw the guy tell you it was a fake!&quot;
         R1 --&gt; Y-Yeah, it's fake
         R2 --&gt; N-No, it's not fake
         R3 --&gt; Are you Alleyway Jack?

         R1: &quot;I'll let you see the show if you become my slave! Well,
             whaddya say?&quot;
             R4 --&gt; Alright
             R5 --&gt; N-No, I don't want to

         R2: &quot;Liar! I'll let you see the show if you become my slave!
             Well, whaddya say?&quot;
             R4 --&gt; Alright
             R5 --&gt; N-No, I don't want to

         R3: &quot;Do I look like that loser!? But I'll let you see the
             show if you become my slave! Well, whaddya say?&quot;
             R4 --&gt; Alright
             R5 --&gt; N-No, I don't want to

         R4: [See below.]

         R5: &quot;Okay... Later!&quot; [He runs off.]

[After picking R4:]

Rat Kid: &quot;Awesome! Now for your first assignment! You go stand over
         there and see if anyone's comin'! All clear?&quot;
         R1 --&gt; Yeah, it's clear
         R2 --&gt; I think someone's coming

         R1: &quot;Awesome! Engage according to mission parameters!&quot;
         R2: &quot;You 'think'!? I wanna know!!! [He repeats his
             original question.]

[The Rat Kid steals Dante's ladder and runs towards the church.]

Rat Kid: &quot;Over here! Don't fall behind! Into the steeple!&quot;

[They run into the steeple.]

Rat Kid: &quot;Now we're gonna climb up this tower! It's very dangerous.
         You go first.&quot;

[The Pointy-Hat Boy goes up to the ladder, and a moogle falls on him.]

Pointy-Hat Boy: &quot;Oww!&quot;

Rat Kid: &quot;Ahahaha! What the heck was that!?&quot;

Moogle: &quot;Sorry 'bout that, kupo!&quot;

Rat Kid: &quot;That's Kupo. He's a moogle.&quot;

Kupo: &quot;Kupo!&quot;

Rat Kid: &quot;And this is slave number one! Try to get along, okay?&quot;

Kupo: &quot;Kupo! Pleased to meet you! I sorry. I enter you in Moogle
      Diary! If you want to save game onto MEMORY CARD, just ask us
      moogles, kupo! And you can regain health if you have a Tent,
      kupo! You understand?&quot;
      R1 --&gt; I understand
      R2 --&gt; Once more...

      R1: &quot;Glad I can help, kupo!&quot;
      R2: [Kupo repeats, starting at &quot;If you want to...&quot;]

Rat Kid: &quot;Alright, time for some upward mobility!&quot;

[He takes Dante's ladder and climbs up the steeple's ladder.]

Rat Kid: &quot;Okay, come on up, slave!&quot;

[Just then, a moogle in clothes walks into the church.]

Stiltzkin: &quot;Kupo...? You here?&quot;

Kupo: &quot;Kupo! Stiltzkin! Why that getup? You leaving, kupo?&quot;

Stiltzkin: &quot;Yeah, and this time I might be away for a long time.&quot;

Kupo: &quot;I'll miss you, kupo.&quot;

Stiltzkin: &quot;Now, don't you worry. I'll write.&quot;

Kupo: &quot;Okay, kupo!&quot;

Stiltzkin: &quot;Well, I'm off. Take care! Oh, and say hi to Mosh in the
           castle for me.&quot;

[Stiltzkin leaves.]

Pointy-Hat Boy: &quot;Was that a friend of yours?&quot;

Kupo: &quot;Yes, kupo. A very special one, kupo!!!&quot;

Rat Kid: &quot;Hey, slave! I thought I ordered you up here!!!&quot;

[The Pointy-Hat Boy climbs up.]

Rat Kid: &quot;Alright, the play's gonna start if we don't hurry!&quot;

[They start running across the rooftops. The Pointy-Hat Boy stops
a rickety plank stretched across some eaves.]

Rat Kid: &quot;Come on! Get over here! Lemme guess... You're afraid of
         heights, aren't you? It's okay! Just pretend you're on
         the ground! Come on, already! We're runnin' outta time!&quot;

[Pointy-Hat Boy crosses and comes to another plank.]

Rat Kid: &quot;Not again... Don't worry! It won't fall!&quot;

[Pointy-Hat Boy crosses, barely, just as it falls.]

Rat Kid: &quot;Hahaha... I guess it fell. No point in worrying now, right?&quot;

[They continue.]

Rat Kid: &quot;Oh yeah, I almost forgot! I don't even know your name!&quot;

[The player can name the Pointy-Hat Boy, default 'Vivi'.]

Rat Kid: &quot;So your name's Vivi, huh? Kinda funny name... My name's
         Puck! Pleased to meetcha!&quot;

[They head to the castle wall.]

Puck: &quot;Whew... We finally made it! After this wall, well be inside
      the castle! C'mon, let's go!&quot;

[They head inside, using the ladder as a walkway and an FMV starts
where the band strikes up and the play raises up, with a lot of jazz
and fanfare. Baku, dressed in regalia, walks onto the stage.]

Baku: &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen! Tonight's performance is a story that
      takes place long, long ago. Our heroine, Princess Cornelia, is
      torn from her lover, Marcus. She attempts to flee the castle,
      only to be captured by her father, King Leo. When our story
      begins, Marcus, having heard of this, crosses swords with the
      king. And now, Your Royal Majesty, Queen Brahne, Your Highness,
      Princess Garnet... ...noble ladies and lords, and our rooftop
      viewers, Tantalus proudly presents 'I Want to Be Your Canary'!&quot;

[Baku bows, and the scene changes to backstage. Cinna, Blank and
Zidane ready their entrance.]

Blank: &quot;Bereft of father! Bereft of mother! Marcus! Thou has lost
       even thy love!&quot;

Cinna: &quot;Fortune hath escap'd thee! For what end shalt thou live?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;For the sake of our friend... Let us bury our steel in the
        heart of the wretched King Leo!&quot;

Blank: &quot;Aye!&quot;
Cinna: &quot;Aye!&quot;

[The three run out onto the stage, where Marcus, Baku, and two others
are readying to square off.]

Blank: &quot;We shall back thee, kinsman!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Pray, sheathe thy swords! This villain is mine alone!&quot;

Cinna: &quot;Nay, kinsman! For I, too, have lost a brother to this fiend!&quot;

King Leo: &quot;What ho? Out, vermin! Away! Thou darest bare thy sword
          before the king!? All who stand in my way will be crush'd!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Treaherous Leo, my kinsman's suffering shall not be in vain!
        For I shall instruct thee in his incomparable pain!&quot;

[The stage battle starts, and King Leo's defeated. He runs to the
stairway afterwards.]

King Leo: &quot;Arrg... Grr... Thou hast not seen the last of me, Marcus!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Come back!&quot;

[Blank stops him.]

Zidane: &quot;Out of the way, Blank!&quot;

Blank: &quot;Consider this, Zidane! If Prince Schnieder were to marry
       Princess Cornelia, peace would reign over both their kingdoms!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;'Tis foolishness! If all were so easy, why, none would suffer
        in this world!&quot;

[Zidane and Blank start their fake sword battle.]

Zidane: &quot;Aha!&quot;
Blank: &quot;Mph!&quot;
Zidane: &quot;Aha!&quot;
Zidane: &quot;Aha!&quot;

[They head down to the viewing area to fight.]

Blank: &quot;En garde!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Expect no quarter from me!&quot;

Narrative: To follow Blank's lead, enter the correct commands from
           the following choices:

                   Up             (/\)
              Left    Right  ([])      (O)
                  Down            (&gt;&lt;)

[They fight a bit.]

Blank: &quot;We shall finish this later!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Come back here!&quot;

===========================================================
02. Alexandria Castle (AC01)
===========================================================

[They run into the castle, and the crowd thinks its part of the act.
Inside, Zidane and Blank beat up two guards and take their clothes
behind a blacked-out screen.]

Voice: &quot;Argh!&quot;
Voice: &quot;Ungh!&quot;
Voice: &quot;Ooof!&quot;
Voice: &quot;Unghaa!&quot;

Blank: &quot;Hehehe! Finished changing, Zidane?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, but this helmet... It kinda smells...&quot;

Blank: &quot;What are you talkin' about!? My helmet totally reeks! My
       armor's way too big... And my back's real itchy... The boots
       are wet... My gloves are all slimy... There's cookie crumbs in
       my pockets...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Okay, I get the picture... You still have the package, right?&quot;

Blank: &quot;Don't worry! I won't screw up!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright! First, I'll go pour some sleep potion into Princess
        Garnet's teacup!&quot;

Blank: &quot;And I've got a special something for the lovely queen!&quot;

[Blank goes over to the beaten-up guards.]

Blank: &quot;Hehehe. They're sleeping so soundly!&quot;

[They both leave the room.]

Blank: &quot;According to recon... ...the royal seats should be right
       above these stairs!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Got it!&quot;

[They hear the crowd roar.]

Blank: &quot;Uh-oh! The scene where Marcus sneaks into Cornelia's chamber
       is about to start! Let's get this over with before the finale,
       okay?&quot;

[They go up the stairs, and a hooded girl runs out.]

Zidane: (Hmm? She sure is dressed funny...)

Hooded Girl: &quot;Umm... Would you please let me pass?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hmm...&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Let her pass
        R2 --&gt; Examine her face

        R1: &quot;Wait. Hold on a sec! Haven't we met before?&quot;

            Hooded Girl: &quot;No, I do not know you...&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;Hmm... Maybe you're right... I'd never let
                    someone as pretty as you get away. Say, you
                    wouldn't--&quot;

            Blank: &quot;Hey, what's goin' on, Zidane?&quot;

            Hooded Girl: &quot;I... I must go!&quot;

            [The girl runs by both men.]

            Blank: &quot;Who the heck was that!?&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;Get up, Blank! That was Princess Garnet!&quot;

            Blank: &quot;Are you serious!?&quot;

        R2: &quot;Let's see...&quot;

            Hooded Girl: &quot;Is there something on my face?&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;Oh, no. You see... I just thought you were the
                    one I'd been waiting for all this time.&quot;

            Hooded Girl: &quot;Excuse me? You were waiting for me?&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;Yeah! I've dreamt of meeting you here ever since
                    I was born!&quot;

            Hooded Girl: &quot;Do you mock me?&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;No, of course not...&quot;

            Hooded Girl: &quot;Then, I shall take my leave of you!&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;Just a sec! Haven't we met before?&quot;

            Hooded Girl: &quot;No, I do not know you...&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;Hmm... Maybe you're right... I'd never let
                    someone as pretty as you get away. Say, you
                    wouldn't--&quot;

            Blank: &quot;Hey, what's goin' on, Zidane?&quot;

            Hooded Girl: &quot;I... I must go!&quot;

            [The girl runs by both men.]

            Blank: &quot;Who the heck was that!?&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;Get up, Blank! That was Princess Garnet!&quot;

            Blank: &quot;Are you serious!?&quot;

[They run after the princess and the view changes to a large stairway
where two jesters run up to each other.]

Zorn: &quot;We are in trouble!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Trouble we are in!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;This is terrible!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Our heads, Queen Brahne will have!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;We must hurry!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;Hurry, we must!&quot;

[They run up the stairs.]

Zorn: &quot;We are in trouble!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;Trouble we are in!&quot;

[They head into the screen Blank and Zidane were in a second ago.]

Thorn: &quot;The right way, that is not!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;I know it is not the right way!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Really, do you?&quot;

Zorn: &quot;I really do!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Wonder, I sometimes do.&quot;

Zorn: &quot;N-Now is not the time to wonder!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Hurry to Queen Brahne, must we!&quot;
Zorn: &quot;We must hurry to Queen Brahne!&quot;

[They go up the stairs and stop again.]

Zorn: &quot;That is not the right way!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;N-Not the right way, I know!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Do you really?&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Know I really do!!!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;I really wonder sometimes.&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Th-The time to wonder, now is not!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;We must hurry and tell Her Majesty!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;Hurry to see Her Majesty, we must!&quot;

[They head to Brahne's seat.]

Zorn: &quot;Your Majesty!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;See the queen, we must!&quot;

Captain of the Knights of Pluto: &quot;Her Majesty is busy! Come back later!&quot;

[A girl with a sword at her side walks over.]

Beatrix: &quot;Is it an emergency?&quot;

Thorn: &quot;An emergency, it is!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;A veritable emergency of terrible urgency!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Very well. I'll see what I can do.&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Very grateful, we'll be!&quot;
Zorn: &quot;We'll be very grateful!&quot;

Captain of the Knights of Pluto: &quot;Grrr! Curse that Beatrix! Always
                                 trying to one-up me!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;So, what exactly is the problem?&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Her Royal Highness...&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Princess Garnet...&quot;

Zorn: &quot;...is in danger!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;...is in danger!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;I see. Wait right here.&quot;

[Beatrix walks to Brahne's seat.]

Queen Brahne: &quot;No interruptions! Can't you see I'm watching the show!?&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Your Majesty, I'm afraid Princess Garnet has--&quot;

Queen Brahne: &quot;Ah, yes... She did leave her seat awhile ago.&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Your Majesty, it seems that Princess Garnet has run off with
         the Royal Pendant.&quot;

Queen Brahne: &quot;Well, of all the... What could she be thinking!?
              General Beatrix!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Your Majesty!&quot;

Queen Brahne: &quot;And, Captain...uh...&quot;

[You can name the Knights of Pluto captain. Default: Steiner.]

Queen Brahne: &quot;Captain Steiner!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Yes, Your Majesty!&quot;

Queen Brahne: &quot;Go find Garnet!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Yes, my queen!&quot;
Beatrix: &quot;At once, Your Majesty!&quot;

[Steiner walks to the screen where Zidane and company were before.]

Steiner: &quot;Knights of Pluto! ASSEMBLE!!! Huh? Where is everybody!?&quot;

[The two guards who were stripped of their uniform run out.]

Blutzen, Pluto Knight II: &quot;Captain, sir!&quot;

Kohel, Pluto Knight III: &quot;All present and accounted for, sir!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;What are you talking about!? There's only two of you! Where
         are the other six!? Why, you useless good-for-nothings! I
         bring orders from the queen! Get dressed and go find Princess
         Garnet!&quot;

[Steiner runs outside, and the crowd roars.]

Steiner: &quot;What!? The play seems to be a hit! But if we fail to find
         the princess before the curtain falls, Her Majesty will be
         most displeased... And we will be the laughingstock of
         Beatrix and her retinue! I must hurry!&quot;

[Steiner climbs the West Tower stairs.]

Steiner: &quot;Whew... Fatigue rears its ugly head. No! I must persevere!
         The princess must be found! Wait! Over there! It's Princess
         Garnet! Being hounded by brigands! Fear not, Princess! Your
         knight is coming!&quot;

[Zidane is chasing the hooded princess around on the opposite tower.
FMV. Garnet gets on a ledge, takes a banner, and swings down to the
Prima Vista. Zidane and Steiner follow, except Zidane reaches his
mark and Steiner crashes off into one of the ship's wooden towers.]

Zidane: &quot;Huh? Where'd the princess go? Woo! Owww...&quot;

[Garnet jumps down, disrupting the band in the process, and flees.
Zidane follows her into the next room, where she runs into Ruby and
looks for a way out.]

Ruby: &quot;Whoa! Whut in tarnation!? Hold yer horses, there! Whut kinda
      cattle you chasin', darlin'? You should at least say yer sorry!&quot;

Hooded Girl: &quot;Please pardon me. I was in a hurry, you see...&quot;

Ruby: &quot;And here I am, fixin' to get ready fer my big entrance!

[Zidane runs in.]

Ruby: &quot;Hey, Zidane! Did you see the way she hit me!? This cowgirl's
      wilder than a buckin' bronco!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Just let me talk to her, Ruby!&quot;

Ruby: &quot;Come again, pardner!? Did you hear what I was sayin'!?&quot;

[Garnet leaves in the commotion.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey! Ruby! We'll talk later!&quot;

[He follows her into the next room.]

Zidane: &quot;Whew... Well, it looks like you've finally made up your mind.&quot;
        (Wow. We really had to improvise. But hey, we got her!)

Hooded Girl: &quot;Do you... do you work on this theater ship?&quot;

Zidane: (Aww... So she figured it out, huh?)

Hooded Girl: &quot;As you have no doubt suspected... ...the truth is that...
             I am actually... Princess Garnet Til Alexandros, heir to
             the throne of Alexandria. I have a favor I wish to ask of
             you... I wish to be kidnapped...right away.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;H-Huh!? I don't... I mean...&quot;

[Steiner makes a racket somewhere.]

Steiner: &quot;Princess! Where are you!?&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Please... They've come for me!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Aha... So that's what's going on... Alright! Leave them to me!&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Thank you. You have my gratitude.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright then, Your Highness! I shall hereby do my best to
        kidnap you!&quot;

[Cinna runs in.]

Garnet: &quot;Ahh!&quot;

Cinna: &quot;What are you two doin'? Come on, this way!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Don't worry, Princess. It's my friend Cinna!&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Oh, really? I am sorry. You startled me.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Well, with a face like his, I'd be pretty shocked, too!&quot;

Cinna: &quot;Man, that hurts! I wash up every morning, you know!&quot;

[Steiner calls out again.]

Steiner: &quot;Princess!?&quot;

Cinna: &quot;This way!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright, we'll follow you!

[They run into the meeting room and shut the door.]

Steiner: &quot;Princess?&quot;

[Steiner runs in.]

Steiner: &quot;Princess... Princess! Princess...? PRINCESS!!!? Princess?&quot;

[A Pluto Knight runs in.]

Steiner: &quot;Where have you been!?&quot;

Knight of Pluto: &quot;Sir! I'm sorry, sir!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess!&quot;

[Inside the meeting room:]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, Cinna! This is a dead end!&quot;

Cinna: &quot;Hehehe. I thought this might happen... Open! Sesame!&quot;

[The table falls over and a passageway down appears.]

Cinna: &quot;So I set up this escape hatch!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess!&quot;

Cinna: &quot;Come on! Jump inside!&quot;

[They all jump in before Steiner can find them.]

Steiner: &quot;The princess must be down there!&quot;

Pluto Knight: &quot;I-I'll go first, sir!&quot;

[The knight (Blank) jumps in and intentionally gets stuck.]

Steiner: &quot;Hey!!! What do you think you're doing!?&quot;

Pluto Knight: &quot;Captain, sir! I'm stuck, sir!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Grrrr! Blast it!!!&quot;

[Steiner runs out.]

Pluto Knight: &quot;Hehehe. He bought it!&quot;

[Down below, the three escapees jump down on the engine.]

Zidane: &quot;Wow, you're really athletic, Princess. I think I'm falling
        for you!&quot;

Garnet: &quot;This is nothing. I have been training to escape the castle,
        after all.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What a waste. If only you weren't a princess...&quot;

Garnet: &quot;We have no time for idle banter. Come, let us move on!&quot;

[They go into the adjacent room, where Steiner enters via a pole.]

Steiner: &quot;Aha! Princess! I, Steiner, shall come to your rescue!&quot;

[Blank runs in.]

Pluto Knight: &quot;You needn't worry, Your Highness!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Good work! This will be remembered as the Pluto Knights'
         finest hour!&quot;

Pluto Knight: &quot;Hehehe! Just relax, Princess. We'll get you outta here!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;WHAT!!!? You're not one of my knights!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You can just...&quot;

Cinna: &quot;...leave the princess...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...to us!&quot;
Cinna: &quot;...to us!&quot;
Blank: &quot;...to us!&quot;

[The battle starts.]

Steiner: &quot;Villains! How dare you trick the princess!

[The party knocks Steiner's block off.]

Steiner: &quot;I'll never give up!&quot;

[Steiner uses a sword technique on Blank, knocking the shoddy Pluto
armor off. A bunch of oglops roam free.]

Steiner: &quot;N-NO!!! I hate oglops!!! I hate oglops!&quot;

Blank: &quot;Oglops are the worst!&quot;

Cinna: &quot;Get these oglops offa me!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Now's our chance! Come on!&quot;

[Zidane and Garnet flee into the next room. Up above, the play is
continuing smoothly. King Leo appears.]

King Leo: &quot;Tonight, I shall finally see my daughter Princess Cornelia
          betroth'd to Prince Schneider! And then Prince Schnieder and
          his kingdom will be mine! Gwahahahaha!&quot;

[The two lackeys from before restrain Marcus.]

Zenero: &quot;Your Majesty!&quot;

Benero: &quot;We have caught an intruder!&quot;

King Leo: &quot;Why, my poor Marcus! Hark, lad. No matter how much thou
          dost treasure Cornelia... ...no matter how deeply she might
          believe she doth love thee... ...never shall I see her marry
          a peasant such as thee! When yon bell strikes three... Under
          the axe thou shall be!&quot;

[Below, Zidane and Garnet run into the room where the actors are
elevated onto the stage.]

Garnet: &quot;What now? We cannot go any further!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hmmm...&quot;

[Cinna runs in.]

Cinna: &quot;Zidane! Get on Number Two!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Okay! Princess Garnet, this way!&quot;

[At that moment, Steiner runs in...]

Steiner: &quot;Stop!

[...and punches Cinna in the face...]

Cinna: &quot;Yow!&quot;

[...and gets on one of the machines himself. King Leo is still saying
his speech above, when Garnet, Zidane, and Steiner appear.]

King Leo: &quot;Furthermore! (P-Princess Garnet!?)

Zidane: (Guys! Just improvise!)

Steiner: &quot;Ho? What's all this?&quot;

[Marcus breaks free and goes to Garnet.]

Marcus: &quot;Cornelia!&quot;

Garnet: (Um...)

Zidane: &quot;(Marcus is Cornelia's lover!)&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Oh, Marcus!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;(Yeah, you're doing great!)&quot;

Garnet: &quot;(Ahaha. I have studied drama, you know.)&quot;

Baku: &quot;(Okay, guys. Let's keep going. Brahne's still watchin', after
      all!)&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Oh, Marcus! I missed you so! I wish never to leave thy side.
        Prithee, lead me from this place!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;See, King Leo? Thou shouldst give them thy blessing!&quot;

King Leo: &quot;Never! Never leave his side, thou sayest? Foolish banter!
          I'll not allow it! Cornelia shall marry none other than this
          man--Prince Schnieder! Is that not so, Prince Schnieder?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;M-Marry the princess? Me!?&quot;

King Leo: &quot;Aye! And this traitorous crew, I will put to death!

[Zidane and Marcus &quot;beat up&quot; Benero and Zenero.]

Benero: &quot;Ooof!&quot;
Zenero: &quot;Oww!&quot;

Benero: &quot;Too many of them!&quot;
Zenero: &quot;Run away!&quot;

King Leo: &quot;Pray, sweet daughter, come home to the castle with me.&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Nay, Father! I shan't return!&quot;

King Leo: &quot;Cornelia... Trouble me no more. This wedding is for thine
          own welfare. Be mindful of that.&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Not if I can help it!!! Now is my moment of vengeance! For
        my parents, and for my love, Cornelia... I shall cut thee
        down!&quot;

[Garnet runs in front of the blade and &quot;gets stuck.&quot;]

Garnet: &quot;Ngh!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;No... Cornelia!!!&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Mar...cus, forgive me. I still love my father...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess!&quot;
King Leo: &quot;Cornelia!&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Prithee, forgive my selfishness, Father, and spare my sweet
        Marcus...&quot;

[Garnet 'dies'.]

Marcus: &quot;What have I done!? Am I never to hear her loving voice again!?
        Am I cursed never again to feel her soft touch!? O, cruel fate!
        Thou hast robbed me of all I treasure!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Marcus!&quot;

[Marcus &quot;stabs&quot; himself.]

Marcus: &quot;Ngah!&quot;

[Up in her box:]

Brahne: &quot;Oh, my! This year's show is splendid! Waaaaaaa! Why did she
        have to die!? Why!?&quot; (Now, where could Garnet be?) &quot;Boo-hoo-
        hoooo!!!&quot;

[Down at the spectators seats:]

Puck: &quot;Wow, what a show!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Yeah, so sad...&quot;

Puck: &quot;I'm glad we climbed all the way over here. How 'bout you, huh?
      Uh-oh! Look out!&quot;

[Two Pluto Knights run after them.]

Haagen, Pluto Knight VIII: &quot;Stop, you!&quot;
Weimar, Pluto Knight VII: &quot;Come back, trespassers!&quot;

[Vivi trips.]

Puck: &quot;Fool! I'm outta here!&quot;

Haagen, Pluto Knight VIII: &quot;Fury!!!&quot;
Weimar, Pluto Knight VII: &quot;Come back here!&quot;

[They chase Vivi onto the stage during the dramatic mourning scene.]

King Leo: &quot;Forgive me!!!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess!!!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Leave me alone!&quot;

Haagen, Pluto Knight VIII: &quot;Stop!&quot;
Weimar, Pluto Knight VII: &quot;Come back here!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Don't come any closer!&quot;

[Vivi uses some fire magic, but it hits Garnet.]

Garnet: &quot;Ow! That's hot!&quot;

[She throws off her hood and everyone can see who it really is.]

Baku: &quot;Zidane! It's time!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Princess Garnet! Let's get outta here!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;What... What is going on!?&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Steiner! Don't follow me anymore!&quot;

Haagen, Pluto Knight VIII: &quot;Captain, sir! We await your orders, sir!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Hmmm... Well... Umm... Errr... Princess! I'm afraid I cannot
         comply!&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Stubborn as always, aren't you?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Come on, Princess. Let's ditch Sir Rustalot and get outta here!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess, wait!&quot;

[Zidane goes over to Vivi.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, kid... You okay!?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Y-Yeah. I just trippd, that's all...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess, I cannot allow you to go! Seize them at once!&quot;

[The party fights the two Pluto Knights and Steiner and beat 'em.
Inside the ship, at the helm:]

Cinna: &quot;Stabilizers configured!&quot;

Baku: &quot;Good!&quot;

Blank: &quot;Engine room is ready to go!&quot;

Baku: &quot;Alright! We're movin' out!&quot;

Cinna: &quot;Roger that!&quot;

Blank: &quot;It's about time!&quot;

[FMV. The Prima Vista attempts to take off, and the Queen orders the
soldiers to fire harpoons onto the deck to detain it. One of the
cannons shoots a gigantic Bomb monsters as well, which attacks the
party, coming up from behind Steiner (in-battle).]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, look behind you!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I'll not fall for such an old trick!&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Please, Steiner! Behind you!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Surrender at once!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;It's a bomb!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;It's gonna blow!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I'll not fall for such an old trick!&quot;

[The bomb grows and grows until Steiner finally sees it. Unfortunately,
it's too late and it blows up. The ship still sails, though, albeit
barely, and it heads out of town. Brahne snaps her fan, frustrated. In
the cockpit:]

Cinna: &quot;We're gonna crash!!!&quot;

[FMV. The Prima Vista sails through the mist clouds and crashes in
a forest below, lighting up the sky. Back in Alexandria, the queen
sits in her throne.]

Queen Brahne: &quot;Garnet... I never imagined you would do such a thing.
              Perhaps you're not such a helpless little girl anymore...
              Zorn! Thorn! Is our little experiment ready?&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Yes, Your Majesty. It is combat-ready!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Easily terminate Princess Garnet, it can, Your Majesty.&quot;

Queen Brahne: &quot;I need her alive! Bring her back at once!&quot;

[Back down at the forest, Zidane walks to a cliff and surveys the
wreckage to the theater ship, which isn't looking quite as merry.]

===========================================================
03. Evil Forest (EF01)
===========================================================

[In the cockpit:]

Baku: &quot;Oww... My back's killin' me. Are you alright?&quot;

Cinna: &quot;Yeah, but the Prima Vista's wasted.&quot;

Baku: &quot;Just our luck to crash into this forest... It's gonna get
      interesting...&quot;

Cinna: &quot;What do you mean, 'interesting,' Boss? I hear no one's ever
       made it outta here alive.&quot;

Blank: &quot;Boss! There's fire everywhere! It's outta control!&quot;

Baku: &quot;Quit yer whinin' and get it under control! And get the wounded
      outta here!&quot;

Blank: &quot;Alright!&quot;

[Blank leaves.]

Baku: &quot;Get our goods outta here, too: weapons, items, anything we can
      use! There's no way we can survive if all our stuff is toast.&quot;

Cinna: &quot;I'm on it!&quot;

[Awhile later, Cinna lies outside on the ground. Boxes and some of
the wounded lie there, too.]

Cinna: &quot;Phew... I'm beat... Hurry up and put out the fire! I can't
       carry 'em all by myself! What the hell are they doin'!? The
       whole ship's gonna burn up!&quot;

Zenero: &quot;They're lookin' for Garnet... Can't find her anywhere. Maybe
        she fell off... Got squashed under the ship.&quot;

Cinna: &quot;This is great. First we kidnap her, then we kill her. We'll
       hang for sure.&quot;

[Zidane finds his way down and runs over.]

Cinna: &quot;Zidane, I'm surprised you made it! I can't believe you jumped
       off! You're nuts, you know that?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I didn't jump off. I got thrown out from the impact. So, is
        everyone okay?&quot;

Cinna: &quot;Yeah. We've all got the devil's luck. But if we don't find
       Princess Garnet, we're all dead meat.&quot;

[A moogle flies down and the words ATE appear on the screen.]

Moogle: &quot;ATE, kupo! Active Time Event is a system that lets you see
        other events that are happening at the same time elsewhere,
        kupo! Press the SELECT button when you see the icon flashing
        below. You can press the button anytime while the icon is
        flashing. Try pressing [SELECT], kupo!&quot;

[The player sees 'The Forest Keeper' ATE, heading into the forest at
Benero's urging. He finds Vivi on his rear, staring in fear.]

Vivi: &quot;Sh-She's in trouble...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...What the hell is that?&quot;

[Zidane runs to Steiner's aid, finding a large plant with Garnet
encaged inside of it.]

Steiner: &quot;Release the princess at once!!!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, like it's gonna actually listen to you. Come on!&quot;

[The party wounds the Prison Cage, but it flees with Garnet.]

Steiner: &quot;Princess? PRINCESS!!!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What the heck? Where did they go?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;She's gone... I was too scared to cast any spells... That
      monster's probably gonna eat her...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;How could I let this happen!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Don't worry. She's not dead yet. That monster was only a
        minion. He's probably gonna take her to his master.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;That means the princess might still be-- Come! We must go
         find her at once!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;WHOA!!!&quot;

[Another Prison Cage swings down and gets Vivi.]

Steiner: &quot;!!!&quot;
Zidane: &quot;!!!&quot;

[The second fight begins and they rescue Vivi.]

Vivi: &quot;Phew... Th-Thanks...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Are you alright?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Y-Yeah... I think so.&quot;

[The Prison Cage rises up...]

Vivi: &quot;!!!&quot;
Zidane: &quot;!!!&quot;
Steiner: &quot;!!!&quot;

[...and sprays a noxious-looking gas at the three. Zidane jumps over
the spray, though. Vivi goes down.]

Steiner: &quot;UGH! P-Prin...cess...&quot;

[Later on, Vivi is resting in a bed on the Prima Vista. Blank stands
there and appears to have been taking care of him.]

Blank: &quot;You guys are lucky. If it weren't for Zidane, you'd both be
       dead. Some of the monsters in this forest reproduce by planting
       seeds in other animals. And when the seeds sprout, it's hasta
       la vista: you become beef jerky.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Um... A-Am I gonna die?&quot;

Blank: &quot;No. You're gonna be fine. Here, drink this. It'll remove all
       the seeds from your body.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Ugh...eeyuck...&quot;

[Elsewhere, a drowsy Steiner is being led to a room by Zenero.]

Steiner: &quot;Princess... I'm coming right now...&quot;

[He runs into Benero.]

Steiner: &quot;...Stand aside!&quot;

Benero: &quot;Room behind you. Go.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;The princess...is in grave danger! Do you intend to ABANDON
         HER!?&quot;

Benero: &quot;You're in no condition.&quot;

Zenero: &quot;Don't worry about the princess. The boss'll think of something.&quot;

[They turn him around...]

Steiner: &quot;Hey! Stop!&quot;

[...and push him into a room.]

Zenero: &quot;Get some rest.&quot;

Benero: &quot;Yeah, and take that medicine I gave you.&quot;

[In the room:]

Steiner: &quot;Dammit... I can't just stand here... The princess's life
         rests in my hands. What cantheir boss possibly accomplish!?
         This medicine... It smells terrible. And the color... This
         is obviously poison! &lt;Huff-huff-heave-heave.&gt; Ugh... I can't
         take it anymore... God help me!&quot;

[He chugs the medicine.]

Steiner: &quot;Hey... Not bad.&quot;

[Up in the cockpit, Baku and Zidane are speaking.]

Baku: &quot;Forget it. Monsters born from the Mist are crawlin' everywhere.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So what? There's nothing out there we can't handle.&quot;

Baku: &quot;Yeah, but what are we gonna do about the wounded?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We can take 'em with us.&quot;

Baku: &quot;How are we gonna carry all of them? Trust me. We go out now,
      and we'll all get wasted. My boys come before the princess, you
      know. It's too bad...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;!!!&quot;

Baku: &quot;We're gonna stay put 'til everyone recovers. You better not
      set one foot outside this ship. You got that!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I can't believe you're abandoning her! You're nothing but a
        big coward!&quot;

[Zidane storms off, and goes down to Vivi's room.]

Vivi: &quot;Oh... Th-Thank you for helping me.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Ah, don't mention it. Besides, it was your black magic that
        saved the day. You know, you've got some major power for such
        a little guy.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What's wrong...? Are you peeved at me because I called you
        little? Hey, you're a great mage with great powers, alright?
        To hell with looks. It's what inside that counts.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I'm sorry. When that monster caught her, I couldn't do anything...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, don't worry about the princess. I'll get her back. I
        promise.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Thank you, Mr. Zidane.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Whoa, that's the first time anyone's called me 'Mr.' Just
        call me Zidane, alright?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Okay...Zidane.&quot;

[Zidane walks out of the room.]

Zidane: &quot;Geez... He was pretty down... Maybe I shouldn't have made
        that promise. I don't even know if I'll be able to find her...&quot;

[Zidane thinks back to when he first met the princess on the stairway
when she was making her escape.]

Zidane: &quot;She was cute... Then again, maybe I only thought so because
        she's a princess. Hmm...... No... She was definitely cute.&quot;

[The flashback ends.]

Zidane: &quot;Man, I can't stop thinking about her... What am I gonna do...?&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Go look for her
        R2 --&gt; Forget her

        R1: &quot;Yeah! What's there to think about!? She's cute...and she's
            in trouble. That's all that matters.&quot; [The Blank scene that
            takes place afterwards starts immediately with this option.]

        R2: &quot;...The boss is right. The guys come first.&quot;

            [Zidane walks up to the empty cockpit.]

            Zidane: &quot;Geez. I don't know what to do...&quot;

            [Another flashback, to when she asks him to kidnap her.]

            Zidane: &quot;I don't know why I was chasing her so hard. I
                    didn't really care about our plan at that point.
                    And it wasn't just because she's such a doll.
                    ......... I can't explain it. I'm just drawn to</pre><pre id="faqspan-2">
                    her so strongly...&quot;

            [Flashback ends.]

            Zidane: &quot;This is crazy. I don't even know her. What am
                    I gonna do...? Yeah! What's there to think about!?
                    She's cute...and she's in trouble. That's all that
                    matters.

Blank: &quot;...There you are. Why do you look so serious? Uh-oh... What
       are you up to this time?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I'm gonna take that knight and the black mage and find the
        princess.&quot;

Blank: &quot;You're crazy! Man, you don't even know what's out there.
       Besides, there's no way the boss'll allow that.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I know...&quot;

Blank: &quot;Sheez... Why do you always gotta play hero? The boss is gonna
       kill you. Well, what are you waiting for? Go talk to the boss.&quot;

[Zidane finds Baku in the meeting room.]

Baku: &quot;AH! AAAH! AAACHOOO!!! Took you long enough... I fell asleep,
      darn it. So, you're leaving, eh?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah... I promised Garnet I'd kidnap her.&quot;

Baku: &quot;Gwahaha! I didn't ask you why! I can't blame you, though.
      She's damn beautiful. I guess that's reason enough! Well, I
      hope you're ready! 'Cause I'm gonna bust you up for breakin'
      the rules.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Alright.&quot;

Baku: &quot;Okay, get your butt over to the cargo room. We got more room
      there.&quot;

[They go to the cargo room.]

Baku: &quot;You ready!?&quot;
      R1 --&gt; Anytime!
      R2 --&gt; Hold on

      R1: &quot;I ain't holdin' back.&quot; [The fight starts.]
      R2: &quot;Hurry up!&quot;

[Zidane wins the battle.]

Baku: &quot;I'll be damned... Bravo!&quot;

[He gut-punches Zidane.]

Baku: &quot;Go find your princess! Gwahahahaha...&quot;

[He leaves.]

Zidane: &quot;Damn, that hurt! He pulled his punches 'til that last one.&quot;

[Zidane goes to Steiner's room. He's sleeping with Cinna's doll.]

Steiner: &quot;............&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Come on. You're too old to be playing with a doll.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Silence! A scoundrel like you could never understand! I'm
         just overwhelmed with concern for the princess! If only you
         rogues hadn't kidnapped her... This is all your fault! If
         anything should happen to the princess, I will have your
         head!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Take it easy. Geez... I'm gonna go look for her now. I'll
        let you come with me if you promise to be good. What do you
        say, Rusty?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;RR...RUSTY!!!? I am Adelbert Steiner, Captain of the Knights
         of Pluto, and I will never work with you conniving thieves!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Captain? I figured you were a private, what with that cheap,
        rusty armor... Look, this has nothing to do with Tantalus.
        It's something I decided to do on my own. I just wanna save
        Garnet.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Hmph...! You had better not be lying! Because if you are, I
         won't hesistate to kill you!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, yeah. I'm counting on you, Rusty.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Make no mistake. I'm only going with you to rescue the
         princess! I'll deal with you personally when this is over!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Whatever.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;It may be difficult with just the two of us. We should seek
         Master Vivi's help as well.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Why are you calling him 'Master'?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;You fool. That black mage has unimaginable powers... I don't
         want to get him involved, but alas, it can't be helped. We
         need Master Vivi's help to rescue the princess.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright, let's go talk to Vivi.&quot;

[They go to see Vivi.]

Zidane: &quot;Well, Vivi, we're ready to go look for the princess.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Really!? That's great! Be careful, okay?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Actually, we want you to come with us, too.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Huh!? B-But I can't do anything.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Hardly, Master Vivi. Your magic was highly effective against
         that monster. In all honesty, I hold your power in greater
         esteem than I do this scoundrel's.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;B-But...I'm scared. I couldn't even move last time.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Please, Master Vivi. For the sake of Princess Garnet and all
         of Alexandria, I humbly request your assistance!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Come on! You're a black mage, for crying out loud! Show us
        what you've got! Alright, let's get going.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...Okay. I'll...try my best.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Thank you, Master Vivi.&quot;

[Zidane leaves.]

Steiner: &quot;Master Vivi...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Yeah?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;It's about your black magic. I wish to try an experiment.
         (I was wondering if...)&quot; &lt;Whisper, whisper...&gt;

Vivi: &quot;Magic sword...? Okay. I'll give it a try.&quot;

[The party goes to leave, but Blank stops Zidane at the exit.]

Blank: &quot;Sheez...you really dig her, huh?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I can't sit around knowing a girl's in trouble. Goes against
        my nature.&quot;

Blank: &quot;Whatever. You're full of crap.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Ohhh.... I get it. You're jealous that I'm gonna get me a
        sweetie pie.&quot;

Blank: &quot;Pshhh... She's not even my type. I came down here to give you
       this.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You're always thinking about me...but I won't need a love
        potion to reel this one in.&quot;

Blank: &quot;Why don't you get your mind off girls for a second? This is
       the medicine I gave to that black mage and the knight. It's
       sort of like a seed remover.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Cool. This'll really come in handy.&quot;

Blank: &quot;Why am I always helping you...?&quot;

[He gives Blank's Medicine to Zidane.]

Blank: &quot;Oh yeah. Here's a little tip from the boss.&quot;

       Don't forget to set your abilities. Leaving the band is your
       business, but you better keep training! Learning more abilities
       is gonna make you even stronger.

       Good luck,
       Baku

Zidane: &quot;Hey, Blank, how do you set abilities again?&quot;

Blank: &quot;Man, how can you forget? It's so basic. Open the Menu, select
       Ability, select Equip, and choose the abilities you wanna set.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Thanks, Blank. I'll see you when I see you.&quot;

Blank: &quot;How about never?&quot;

[Zidane and company head into the forest, eventually coming to a
spring.]

Zidane: &quot;Hmm... No sign of any monsters here. A spring...&quot;

[An ATE, 'Do As I Say, Not As I Do' plays. The party heads on and
eventually comes to a cavern where a giant plant and an unconscious
Garnet are.]

Vivi: &quot;There she is!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So this is the master.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess!!! You stay out of this! Alexandria would be
         disgraced if a mere bandit should rescue the princess.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You think you can handle him on your own?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Let's get him, Vivi!&quot;

[The battle starts, and Blank arrives during it. They defeat the
creature together. Steiner cradles the princess afterwards.]

Steiner: &quot;Princess!!! Please get a hold of yourself!&quot;

Blank: &quot;Zidane, give her the stuff.&quot;

Garnet: &lt;Hack-hack...&gt;

Steiner: &quot;Princess, please try to drink all of it.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Is she gonna be okay?&quot;

[The ground rumbles.]

Blank: &quot;Oh, man! What now!?&quot;

[The place where the Plant Brain sat collapses, and spiders come out.]

Blank: &quot;Sheez! We're gonna be surrounded!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Let's get out of here!&quot;

Blank: &quot;GO! What are you waitin' for!?&quot;

[They continue on, battling a few spiders as they make their getaway.
Zidane turns around for a moment.]

Blank: &quot;What are you doin'!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Something's wrong...&quot;

Blank: &quot;What?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;The entire forest is coming after us. Blank... Take care of
        everyone.&quot;

Blank: (What did he mean by that?)

[They start running again. FMV: legions of spiders chase the fellows
and the forest starts to petrify itself in an effort to stop them.
A spider attacks Zidane, but he moves out of the way and it catches
Blank. Zidane takes a map that Blank threw at him and runs to the
exit, dodging spiny plant tentacles, and makes it out. The forest
entrance closes and the player sees that Blank was petrified along
with the forest. Afterwards, Zidane searches for a way in.]

Zidane: &quot;Dammit!!! That idiot! Blank...&quot;

[The party makes camp as dusk hits, and they gather around a campfire
on the outskirts of the forest.]

Vivi: &quot;I hope she gets well soon...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;This is all his fault! Have you nothing to say, you filth!?&quot;

Garnet: &quot;...Oh...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;P-Princess!!!&quot;

Garnet: &quot;...Steiner? ...How did I survive...? You brought me here?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;It is my sworn duty to protect you at any cost.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What are you talking about? It was Vivi's magic and my dagger
        that got you out of there, Princess.&quot;

Garnet: &quot;I thank you both.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;That monkey deserves no praise! None of this would've
         happened if you and your band hadn't abducted the princess!
         And how dare you claim to have rescued her!? When we get back
         to Alexandria, I will--&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Steiner... I left the castle of my own will.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What a coincidence, eh? We went to snatch her, and she wanted
        to be snatched.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Impossible!&quot;

Garnet: &quot;It's true.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So what do you say, Rusty? Friends? Come on, let's enjoy this
        camping trip while it lasts.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Camping--you imbecile! Surely even you must know something
         about the Mist! The vicious monsters it spawns! The
         abnormalities it stirs in the mind and body! Princess, we
         must leave this dangerous place at once.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You've got to be kidding. She hasn't even fully recovered yet.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Silence! Who asked for your opinion!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright, tell me... How do you plan to get out of here? We're
        standing in a valley surrounded by tall cliffs. And last I
        heard, North Gate and South Gate were sealed off.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;.........&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah. That's what I thought.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Grrrrr...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;The princess can barely walk right now. You went through this.
        You should know. I think we should rest here for now.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I will never follow your--&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Steiner!!! State your sworn duty!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;What else!? To protect Princess Garnet Til Alexandros!
         ...Very well. Until the princess recovers, I will guard this
         place with my life.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Sounds good to me. Vivi, let's get some rest.&quot;

[The next morning, Zidane inspects the forest entrance again. The
princess walks over.]

Zidane: &quot;How are you feeling?&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Good...thanks to that medicine you gave me. Could this be...?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, I was surprised, too. After we beat that big plant-guy,
        the forest got completely petrified.&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Vivi told me that we were able to escape because of your
        friend.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...His name is Blank.&quot;

Garnet: &quot;We must go help him.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We can't do anything for him right now.&quot;

Garnet: &quot;But...I can't--&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We'll come back for him. I'm sure there's a way to cure him.
        Let's get going. According to the map that Blank gave me,
        there's a cavern to the south of us. Maybe we can get above
        the mist through that cavern. Are you alright? Everything's
        gonna be fine. Trust me.&quot;

[At the campsite, a moogle comes out of the forest.]

Vivi: &quot;Look! There's something coming!&quot;

Monty: &quot;Wait! Kupo! I'm impressed, kupo! First time I've seen anyone
       escape from Evil Forest. You all must be strong, kupo! But
       don't get cocky, kupo. Lots of stronger monsters ahead. Before
       you go out to the world, Mogster will teach you a few things.&quot;

[An ATE plays (&quot;Teach me, Mogster!&quot; Lesson 1) and afterwards:]

Monty: &quot;I have a gift for you, kupo. Take this flute. With this flute,
       you can call us anywhere in the world, kupo. Press ([]) to play
       it. Happy trails! Kupo!&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Monty: &quot;Kupopo!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Bye.&quot;

Monty: &quot;Kupoo!&quot;

[Zidane slaps Steiner on the back and walks off with the rest of the
party. Steiner looks around unwittingly.]

Steiner: &quot;!!! What the... Who goes there!?&quot;

Monty: &quot;Your friends already left, kupo.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess, wait!&quot;

===========================================================
04. North Gate (NG01)
===========================================================

[On the world map, after leaving Evil Forest, a large gate is at the
end of the valley. It's not a necessary stop, however. When the party
gets there, they see banners flying and smoke plumes on the other
side.]

Garnet: &quot;Where are we?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I think this is the North Gate. It's beneath the Mist. It
        lies between Alexandria and Burmecia. I think it's called...
        Melda Arch or something? Fresh footprints... And there's smoke
        rising.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;That flag...! That is Alexandria's war banner! How dare they
         commit crimes in the name of Alexandria! I should like to
         arrest and punish them if the circumstances were different!&quot;

Garnet: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Let's get outta here. The cavern lies to the left of this
        arch. We'll follow the ledge!

===========================================================
05. Ice Cavern (IC01)
===========================================================

[The party walks up to the mouth of the frigid place from the world
map. Cold mist pours out constantly.]

Zidane: &quot;This must be the cavern...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;U-Um...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What's up, Vivi?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Have you ever heard of the Ice Cavern?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Sure... Is this the place?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I think so... It's supposed to be near Evil Forest.&quot;

Garnet: &quot;...I've heard of it. It's supposed to be a beautiful place,
        covered in ice.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;My grandpa told me about this place. He said the cavern takes
      travelers to the top of the Mist.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Bravo! Master Vivi's grandfather must be quite a scholar!
         We must thank him upon escaping the Mist!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;My grandpa used to teach me lots of things, but he passed
      away...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Oh... Forgive my indiscretion.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Don't worry about it.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Well...why don't we go inside?&quot;

[They all walk in. There are plants frozen in bloom near the ledges.]

Garnet: &quot;Oh...! What a beautiful place! Seeing the actual cavern is
        so much better than reading about it! Oh, how pretty... I
        wonder what kind of flower this is?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess! Please, don't touch anything!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Can we get moving? I'm freezin' here.

[On the side of the path ahead is a weird wall.]

Zidane: &quot;Huh? What's this...? What a strange wall... There's gotta
        be something behind it. Hey, Vivi!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Y-Yes?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Can you break this wall down with your magic?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I...I'm coming.

[Vivi melts the wall, revealing a treasure chest.]

Zidane: &quot;Whoa! I knew it! See? There might be other walls like this...
        I'm counting on you, Vivi!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;S-Sure!&quot;

[They come to another wall soon.]

Zidane: &quot;Huh? What's this...?&quot;

[Vivi destroys it.]

Zidane: &quot;Whoa!

[A stump near by gets the same treatment.]

Zidane: &quot;Whoa!

[After a few more walls the party comes to forked path, and a long
ledge by taking the right way. Vivi straggles in the weird mist.]

Zidane: &quot;Vivi, hurry up, or you'll be left behind!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I...I'm coming.&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Oh no!&quot;

[Vivi falls over a ledge and collapses. Steiner walks over...]

Steiner: &quot;Master Vivi! Are you okay?&quot;

[...and collapses, too.]

Zidane: &quot;Yo, Rusty! You're...not alright, are you? What happened to
        you guys? Hey, Rusty! Move it or lose it! Get up! ...It's no
        use.&quot;

[Garnet collapses when Zidane isn't looking.]

Zidane: &quot;Oh no! Garnet! Not you, too? Garnet? She's out cold...
        Shoot... I'm falling asleep...&quot;

[Zidane collapses, too, but wakes up later, hearing something.]

Zidane: &quot;What's that sound...? It came from over there... Is
        somebody there...?

[Zidane walks to the bottom of a frozen waterfall.]

Voice: &quot;Why didn't you fall asleep?&quot;

[Zidane looks up to see a black mage-type thing.]

Black Waltz No. 1: &quot;You should be dead by now...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Are you the one causing this blizzard?&quot;

Black Waltz No. 1: &quot;Hee-hee-hee... That's right!&quot;

[Zidane fights the Black Waltz and its summoned Sealion, defeating
them. After-battle, a voice yells:]

Voice: &quot;You defeated No. 1, but No. 2 and No. 3 will reclaim the
       princess!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wh-Who's there? Oh, whatever... I've gotta go back and
        check on them!&quot;

[Zidane leaves and the player can see that Zorn and Thorn were up
near the exit, watching the entire course of events. Back where the
rest of the sleeping party was, everyone's waking up now that the
strange blizzard's stopped.]

Garnet: &quot;Zidane!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, there. Everybody okay?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;You! What just happened?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It was no big deal.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;You're hiding something!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, nothing happened. You heard me.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;You...didn't touch the princess, did you?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Just what are you accusing me of?&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Steiner, he said nothing happened. Why are you being so rude?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;...My apologies, Princess.&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Well, I'm glad everyone is safe. Shall we move on? Zidane?
        Is something bothering you?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;No... It's nothing.&quot;

[The party heads up to the exit and emerges into the mountain air.]

Garnet: &quot;We made it through the Mist! Oh, the sun feels great!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Look, there's a village. I think I've been there before...&quot;

Garnet: &quot;It sounds like you've been everywhere before, Zidane. The
        only other worlds I've visited are in books. You may have been
        to that village. Let's go visit.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wait. Hold it. You're a princess! You can't just go rushing
        in there. People are looking for you. You need a new identity.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Insolent fool! The princess need not sneak around! Besides,
         we're heading back to the castle. You leave her alone. And
         you will address her as 'Princess' from now on, you silly
         peasant!&quot;

[Steiner pushes Zidane and he drops his dagger.]

Zidane: &quot;Dammit, Rusty! Why don't you just shut up? Who do you think
        you are? I don't take orders from a stuck-up jerk like you!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;You guys!&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Stop it, you two! ...Steiner, I do not intend to return to
        the castle. And I do see Zidane's point. I need a new name...
        Zidane... What is this called?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That? That's a dagger. All knives of that length are called
        daggers. Short swords are a bit longer. The big sword you hold
        with both hands is called a broadsword. And...&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Oh, okay... I understand now. So this is called a 'dagger'...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess! It's a weapon! Please be careful.&quot;

Garnet: &quot;I've decided! From now on, my name is...&quot;

[Garnet's name now becomes Dagger. The player can choose it to his/her
fitting, though.]

Garnet: &quot;I will be called Dagger from now on. What do you think,
        Zidane?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Is that okay with you?&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Yes
        R2 --&gt; No

        R1: &quot;Great, Dagger. Now, let's work on your speech... Try to
            sound more casual. Like me.&quot;

            Garnet: &quot;I shall try.&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;No, no, no...&quot; (What would Vivi say...?)

            Vivi: &quot;?&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;Just say... 'Alrighty.'&quot;

            Garnet: &quot;A-Alrighty!&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;You're getting the hang of it! Well... Let's
                    go.&quot;

        R2 (Garnet): &quot;I'll pick a different name. Let's see...&quot;

           [Her name can be chosen again.]

           Garnet: &quot;I will be called ______ from now on. Is that better?&quot;

[The party walks down the slope and arrives at the world map.]

===========================================================
05. South Gate (SG01)
===========================================================

[Up on the plateau, opposite from the village, is a gate.]

Guard: &quot;Huh? What do you want?&quot;
       R1 --&gt; I want to pass through
       R2 --&gt; I want to take a break
       R3 --&gt; I want to talk
       R4 --&gt; Nothing

       R1: &quot;You gotta have a Gate Pass to pass through here. There's
           no work here right now. Try again when they need construction
           workers.&quot;

       R2: &quot;The shopgirl at Vega won't be here for a while.&quot;
           R5 --&gt; I can wait.
           R6 --&gt; Maybe some other time.

       R3: &quot;South Gate is the border of Alexandria and Lindblum. We
           check every airship and person crossing the border. We're
           doing the best we can to keep the two nations safe. Have
           you ever been on an airship?&quot;

       R4: [Dialogue cancelled.]

       R5: &quot;Then wait right there.&quot;

       R6: [Dialogue cancelled.]

[After selecting R5, a girl comes down the path a few minutes later.]

Part-time Worker Mary: &quot;Hello! I'm Mary. I work at Vega, an item shop.
                       Sorry to keep you waiting. How can I help you?&quot;
                       R1 --&gt; I want to rest
                       R2 --&gt; I want to shop
                       R3 --&gt; Nothing

                       R1: &quot;It's 100 Gil to rest here.&quot; {Rest/Don't Rest}
                       R2: [She shows her wares.]
                       R3: [Dialogue cancelled.]

===========================================================
06. Village of Dali (DL01)
===========================================================

[The party walks into the quaint village.]

Vivi: &quot;Gee whiz, a windmill!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Vivi, the inn is this way!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Aw, do we have to? ...But I wanna go see the windmill.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I know. But let's get some rest first. We also need to decide
        what to do next.&quot;

[They walk into the inn. Two little boys emerge once they're gone.]

Boy in Blue: &quot;Did you see that?&quot;

Boy in Brown: &quot;I sure did!&quot;

[Inside the inn, they find a man snoozing at the front desk.]

Zidane: &quot;Sleeping on the job?&quot;

Innkeeper Hal: &quot;Oh, I'm sorr...y. ......&quot;

[He stares in Vivi and Garnet's direction.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, I know she's cute, but it's rude of you to stare.&quot;

Innkeeper Hal: &quot;Oh, I-I wasn't looking at the young lady. I was
               just... The room is right over there. Make yourselves
               at home.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Um...Zidane? Where will I be staying?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;In the same room. Where else?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;But, Zidane... I mustn't...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I understand how you feel, but these country inns don't have
        private rooms. Get inside, everyone.&quot;

[They all walk into the four-bed room.]

Zidane: &quot;Tell me one thing before we go to sleep. Why did you wanna
        leave the castle, Dagger?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;If the theater ship hadn't crashed...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It would've arrived at the neighboring regency of Lindblum.
        You were gonna leave Alexandria!? I see. If you hadn't been
        caught, you would've reached Lindblum by now. But now... We'll
        have to cross South Gate on foot. Border crossing, huh?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane, please listen. There is a reason I must leave this
        kingdom. I cannot tell you why... But...please...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I understand... I'll get you to Lindblum somehow.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I've heard enough! Princess, you cannot trust the words of
         a thief! He may expose you to even more danger, like he did
         in Evil Forest! I beg of you, Princess. Please return with me
         to the castle.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I know I screwed up in Evil Forest. But there's no doubt in
        my mind now. I'll protect Dagger with my life!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Don't be ridiculous! It is I who protect the princess, now
         and forever!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Then tell me. How do you intend to take her back to the castle?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I-I will think of a way...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Zzz... Zzz...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Master Vivi...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;He was tired. But you had to go on a tirade.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;What!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Let's go to sleep.&quot;

[Everyone takes a nap. Later on, a girl sings.]

Zidane: &quot;What a...beautiful voice... Who's singing...? I've never
        heard a song like that before... ...Was that Dagger singing?
        Oh, everyone's up already. I wonder where they went?&quot;

[Vivi goes into town and sees Vivi by the windmill.]

Vivi: &quot;Zidane!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, Vivi. What's up?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;N-Nothing, I was just thinking.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Ah, I see.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You met a girl!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;No, no! Nothing like that!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What? Don't tell me you don't like girls!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I never really thought about stuff like...that.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I'm always thinking about girls. I'm popular with ALL the
        ladies in Lindblum. Come to me if you have any girl trouble,
        okay?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;S-Sure. Thanks.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Okay, then. We need to decide what to do. I'm gonna go look
        for Dagger and Rusty. Would you mind heading back to the inn?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Sure, I'll head back.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So, what were you staring at?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Nothing. But I keep hearing a sound like 'kweh.'&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That's the sound chocobos make...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;......&quot;
Zidane: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I'll see you back at the inn!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Okay!&quot;

[Zidane leaves.]

Vivi: &quot;What are chocobos...? Chocobo!?&quot;

[A man snatches up Vivi and runs off.]

Vivi: &quot;Aaah!&quot;

[Zidane stops on his way back to the inn.]

Zidane: &quot;Huh? Forget Steiner. I wonder where Dagger is.&quot;

[He finds her staring at merchandise in the equipment shop.]

Zidane: &quot;Dagger...&quot; (What's she looking at?)&quot;

[It takes a moment before she notices him over her shoulder.]

Dagger: &quot;Zidane!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You got a fever or something? Your face is all red.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I-It's nothing. I'm fine.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You're acting strange...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I get it!!! You changed the way you talk!&quot;
        R1 --&gt; You're doing great!
        R2 --&gt; You still sound funny, though


        R1 (Dagger): &quot;Thanks!&quot;
        R2 (Dagger): &quot;I just started! I'll master it soon enough!&quot;

[Dagger waits a moment.]

Dagger: &quot;I did fine in the play, didn't I?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh yeah, I thought...&quot;
        R1 --&gt; You were Ruby!
        R2 --&gt; You sure know how to fake it!

        R1 (Dagger): &quot;I'm a big fan of Lord Avon's plays. I have--
                     I mean, I've seen all of them. 'I Want to Be
                     Your Canary' is one of my favorites!&quot;

           Zidane: &quot;Oh yeah?&quot;

           Dagger: &quot;Is Ruby the young lady with the strange accent?&quot;

           Zidane: &quot;Uh, yeah.&quot;

           Dagger: &quot;Should I talk more like her?&quot;

           Zidane: &quot;What? No, no. She's really finicky about her
                   speech. She always laughs at us whenever we try
                   to mimic her. So you should just be yourself,
                   Dagger.&quot;

           Dagger: &quot;I understa...Alrighty!&quot;

           Dagger: &quot;Tee hee.&quot;
           Zidane: &quot;Ha ha...&quot;

        R2 (Dagger): &quot;Fake!? How insensitive! I love Lord Avon's
                     plays. I've seen all of them. 'I Want to Be Your
                     Canary' is one of my favorites. I even have all
                     the lines memorized! I shall...I'll learn soon
                     enough.&quot;

           Zidane: &quot;Geez, you don't have to get so mad. I'm sorry.
                   We need to decide what to do from here. Will you
                   go back to the inn?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What about you?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I'll head back soon.&quot;
Zidane: &quot;I'm gonna look for Vivi and Steiner.&quot; [Said if you haven't
        talked to Vivi yet.]

Dagger: &quot;Alrighty. I'll catch you later.&quot;

Zidane: (Good! You sound just like a normal village girl.
        Crossing the border might not be so tough after all...)

[Dagger bows to Eve before leaving.]

Dagger: &quot;Thanks. I had fun!&quot;

Shopkeeper Eve: &quot;Bye!&quot;

[Zidane looks around for Steiner.]

Zidane: &quot;I'll just let Steiner be and go back to the inn.

[Zidane heads back.]

Zidane: &quot;Did you wait long? I asked Vivi to head back. He should be
        back soon. How do you like this village? Pretty different from
        the castle, I bet.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yes. The kids are very energetic, and there are so many
        things to see. I've never walked around so freely in my life!
        But... Where are all the adults?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah... I used to see them tending the farm next to the
        village.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;But that farm is tiny.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah. There's something strange going on... We'll leave once
        Vivi gets back.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;But... What about Steiner?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I have a good plan for crossing South Gate. It's gonna be
        easy! They're not looking for the rest of us, so we'll just
        hide you! Forget about Rusty. Leave everything to me!&quot;

[The ATE 'Queen Brahne's Steiner' plays. Afterwards, Dagger is
listening to Zidane tell a story.]

Zidane: &quot;...As it turns out, it didn't matter that we snuck into their
        mansion. But the Kings were hiding something in their mansion...
        What's wrong? Am I boring you?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Oh, no. Your story is very interesting. But I'm concerned
        about Vivi. Why isn't he back yet?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You're right. He is late. I'm not worried about Steiner, but
        Vivi, I'm not so sure about. Let's go look for him.&quot;

[They go out into the square.]

Zidane: &quot;Wait a minute... Last time I saw Vivi, he was standing over
        there.&quot;

[They go closer.]

Zidane: &quot;Did I hear a chocobo? Vivi said he heard a chocobo here.&quot;

Voice: &lt;Sniff... Sniff...&gt;

Zidane: &quot;Is someone crying...?&quot;

Voice: &lt;Sniff... Sniff...&gt;

[Zidane looks at a little pipe by the windmill shed.]

Zidane: &quot;It's coming from the hole... Vivi...?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...Zidane?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Vivi! Where are you? Are you underground? Can you move?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;They told me to stay here...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Are you hurt?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;No.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Don't worry, we'll get you out. We'll hurry, so stay where
        you are, okay?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...Okay.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What's going on in this village...? There's gotta be a way
        into the underground somewhere. Let's look for one.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Okay!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It seems like such a quiet village...&quot;

[In the windmill, Yaff is no longer present. Zidane cracks open a
hatch the guard'd previously rested on.]

Zidane: &quot;Heh, isn't this obvious? There's a cool breeze...&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Go down
        R2 --&gt; Don't go down

        R1: [Zidane and Dagger go down.]
        R2: [Hatch is closed, unentered.]

[Inside, the party runs down a path to where some light in a little
hut streams out.]

Zidane: &quot;This isn't... ...just a regular storage facility.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What's going on?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;(Shhh!)&quot;

[Inside the little hut, two men talk.]

Man: &quot;Why is it moving? Is it true that the mayor's brother found it?&quot;

Young Man: &quot;I guess they reconciled. His brother's one of us now.&quot;

Man: &quot;...Wasn't he on the old lady's side before?&quot;

Young Man: &quot;Oh, about abandoning the farm? He probably only said that
           because he was fighting with the mayor. Who cares? We need
           more workers anyway. Hey, let's put this in a box.&quot;

Man: &quot;I guess the guys at the castle will take care of it.&quot;

Zidane: (The castle...!?)

Young Man: &quot;Yup. We're only in charge of production.&quot;

Garnet: &quot;!&quot;

Man: &quot;Gotcha.&quot;

Garnet: (The pattern on this barrel...)

Young Man: &quot;Come along, now.&quot;

[The two men come out of the hut with--]

Zidane: &quot;(Vivi!)&quot;

Young Man: &quot;Hurry up!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That bastard!&quot;

Garnet: &quot;(Zidane! Wait!)&quot;

Zidane: &quot;(Geez! Hey!)&quot;

[Garnet drags Zidane back into the previous screen. Vivi walks with
the men.]

Vivi: &quot;......&quot;

[In the other hallway:]

Zidane: &quot;What is it!?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Did you see the large barrel next to the shed? I've seen the
        exact same pattern on some of the barrels at the castle. This
        place must have some kind of connection with Alexandria
        Castle. I must know what it is! So please... I beg of you,
        don't cause any trouble just yet.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Alright. But I will start trouble if Vivi is in danger.
        Agreed?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Sure.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright, let's go. They went further inside.&quot;

[The two enter and come into a large room.]

Zidane: &quot;What the heck is that?&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Zidane!&quot;

[He runs to a gigantic machine that's in use.]

Zidane: &quot;What is it?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Someone's crying...&quot;

Voice: &lt;Sniff... Sniff...&gt;

Zidane: &quot;...... ...Vivi?&quot;

[A voice comes from a box nearby.]

Vivi: &quot;Zidane!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It IS you! I'll get you out! Why would they stuff you in a box?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;How could they...?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;U-Um...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We'll talk later! Hooold on! ...It's open!&quot;

[Vivi's freed.]

Zidane: &quot;What happened?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;After you left, some men kidnapped me and brought me here. They
      told me to stay put. I was so scared... I didn't know what to
      do. They asked me, 'Why were you outside?' and then they said,
      'The cargo ship isn't even here yet.' I didn't know what they
      were talking about, so I didn't say anything, and then they said,
      'Let's put it in with today's shipment.'&quot;

Dagger: &quot;And they put you in that box?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...Yeah.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Well, I'm glad you're safe. Listen, Vivi. You gotta do
        something next time. You should try-- screaming back or
        whatever.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Screaming...?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, like...'Get off me, you scumbag!'&quot;

Garnet: (Scumbag?)

Zidane: &quot;Like that! It surprises your attacker and empowers you!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Huh... I see.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I need to ask you a favor, Vivi. We want to check out what's
        ahead. I know you might not be thrilled with the idea, but...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...Zidane, I wanna know more, too. Look... What is that thing?&quot;

[The gigantic machine spits out a weird ball, which travels along
down the assembly line.]

Zidane: &quot;Alright, we'll all go together!&quot;

[They head past the 'egg' conveyor belt, and Zidane takes a peek
at what's happening in the darkness.]

Zidane: &quot;I can almost see inside... ...but I can't see anything. I
        just hear some noise. Are the eggs...hatching?&quot;

[They run into the next room.]

Vivi: &quot;Ahhh! What is this!?&quot;

[Large-scale version of Vivi-like black mages are coming out of the
end of the 'egg' machine, and they ride lifeless on hooks that head
towards a last machine.]

Zidane: &quot;They're... Some parts are different, but... (...They look
        like Vivi.)&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Wh-What is this...? Are they...dolls?&quot;

[Zidane looks behind him.]

Zidane: &quot;!&quot; (Someone's coming!) &quot;Vivi! Dagger!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Why...? Is my mother behind this...?

Zidane: &quot;This is the only way!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Wh-Whoa!&quot;
Dagger: &quot;Ahhh! What are you doing, Zidane!?&quot;

[Zidane picks up Garnet and takes Vivi's hand and runs away, taking
refuge inside the last machine.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Ahhh! ...Murf...! !!! ...!!!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Sorry! But stay quiet!&quot;

[A man walks to where the three just were.]

Young Man: &quot;Hey! Did you say something?&quot;

Worker: &quot;Nope. Not me.&quot;

Young Man: &quot;Okay. Never mind. It's almost time. Hurry it up, will ya?&quot;

Worker: &quot;I hear ya!&quot;

[A box drops in through the top of the machine.]

Zidane: &quot;Whoa!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane!?&quot;

[A boxed-in Zidane travels the length of the conveyor belt and is
stuck into a large barrel. Two more boxes come to collect on Vivi and
Dagger, too.]

Vivi: &quot;Ahhhhhh!&quot;
Dagger: &quot;Vivi!&quot;

[Meanwhile, at the mountain nearby, Steiner is talking to Morrid.]

Steiner: &quot;Pardon me! I must escort a person of high rank to the
         castle! When will the cargo ship arrive?&quot;

Morrid: &quot;Hmm... Looks good. You're in my way.&quot;

[Morrid goes down the stairs.]

Steiner: &quot;I shall persevere!&quot;

[Steiner follows him down to his hut.]

Morrid: &quot;The smell off coffee relaxes me. How about a cup?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Oh, thank you.&quot;

[Steiner thinks a moment.]

Steiner: &quot;I am not here to drink coffee! Tell me when the cargo ship
         will arrive, or else the Alexandrian royal family will
         appropriate this property!&quot;

Morrid: &quot;And then what?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I order you to tell me when the cargo ship will arrive!
         Tell meeeee!!!&quot;

Morrid: &quot;You're not a very creative interrogator.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I am just trying to do what is right!&quot;

Morrid: &quot;Who decides right and wrong? You?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Anyone can tell right from wrong.&quot;

Morrid: &quot;Ha ha ha... Still as green as a pickle.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;When will the cargo ship arrive!?&quot;

Morrid: &quot;It's already here. They should be loading it now.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Why couldn't you tell me sooner!? Thank you!&quot;

[Steiner runs out of the mountain and towards the cargo ship.]

Steiner: &quot;Ah! It is indeed the cargo ship! Now I can take the princess
         back to the castle! Now I must think of a way to get her on
         the ship... Wha!? There is something coming out of the ground!&quot;

[At the loading dock, a flap in the ground lets the chocobo pull one
of the barrels out.]

Man: &quot;I wonder what they're gonna use them for? We've been making lots
     of 'em since they set up the factory six months ago.&quot;

Young Man: &quot;Who cares? This is a piece of cake compared to farming.
           Better money, too. ...... H-Hey! Is that scary guy in armor
           running towards US!?&quot;

Young Man 2: &quot;...... Let's get outta here!&quot;

[The men flee, and Steiner runs over to a barrel.]

Steiner: &quot;This barrel... What could be inside!? What could they
         possibly be shipping out from this village? What the--&quot;

[The barrel moves.]

Steiner: &quot;Did I just see that barrel move? Let's see...&quot;
         R1 --&gt; Poke it with a sword
         R2 --&gt; Observe it some more

         R1: &quot;Hyah!&quot; [He stabs.]

             Voice: &quot;OW! OOOWWWWWWCH!!!&quot;

             [Zidane skyrockets out.]

             Zidane: &quot;What did you do that for!?&quot;

             Steiner: &quot;You!!!&quot;

             Zidane: &quot;You almost stabbed Dagger!&quot;

             Steiner: &quot;The princess!?&quot;

             [Zidane jumps off onto Steiner's head.]

             Steiner: &quot;Ouch!&quot;

         R2: &quot;I've seen this pattern somewhere before... Ah!&quot;

             [The barrel moves again.]

             Steiner: &quot;It's moving!&quot;

             Zidane: &quot;Alright, give it another push!&quot;

             Steiner: &quot;Aaargh! The barrel spoke! Gragh!&quot;

             [The barrel tips over onto Steiner.]

[Soon, everyone's piled out and Steiner's in a huff.]

Steiner: &quot;Princess, what in the world is going on!? You scoundrel!
         Is this your doing!?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Steiner, please!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Yes, Your Highness...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane, I don't know what to say to Vivi. I never knew
        anything suspicious was going on at the castle...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We still don't know for sure. Let's stay by Vivi's side.&quot;

Steiner: (This is not the time to panic... I must get the princess
         onboard the cargo ship somehow. Then we can head back to
         Alexandria Castle.)

Zidane: &quot;Yo, Rusty, do you know where this airship's going?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;...... ...L-Lindblum. Yes, to Lindblum.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That's convenient! Did you ask someone?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Th-The old man in the shack told me! So it must be true!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You're acting strange...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Something is headed this way!&quot;

[A large winged monster, like Black Waltz No. 1, flies over.]

Creature: &quot;Princess Garnet, the queen is waiting for you at the castle!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You were all sent by the castle!?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;What? What are you talking about!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You were all unconscious from the blizzard. He said he was a
        Black Waltz!&quot;

Creature: &quot;Are you the one who defeated No. 1? I am Black Waltz No. 2!
          My power, magic, and speed make me far superior to No. 1!
          Resistance is futile! Come, Princess. The queen awaits!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;No! I will not return to the castle.&quot;

Black Waltz No. 2: &quot;Come with me, or you'll regret it!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Wait! I, Steiner, shall escort the princess back to the
         castle!&quot;

Black Waltz No. 2: &quot;Kee hee hee! You think I care? I won't let you
                   stand in the way of my mission!&quot;

[The battle begins and they defeat No. 2]

Dagger: &quot;Black Waltz No. 2... Did my mother really send him to
        capture me...?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;It can't be! There is no reason to trust the words of
         some bandit. He was just another criminal, scheming to use
         the princess for some evil deed.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Have I not been careful enough?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Your noble upbringing cannot be disguised so easily.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That's not true at all. You haven't been watching. Dagger
        is trying really hard. You're the one with the problem!
        Walking around, yelling 'Princess!' everywhere... About the
        border crossing...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yes?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Why don't we hitch a ride on this airship?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Sure, Lindblum should not be terribly far by airship! I
        mean...'won't be too far.' But why don't we get some rest
        before we go?&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Rest at the inn
        R2 --&gt; Depart now

        R1 (Zidane): &quot;Okay. Let's head back to the village. Vivi,
                     you'll be safe with me.&quot; [They head back to
                     the village, etc.]

        R2: [See below.]

[After picking R2:]

Zidane: &quot;Wait here while I ask the people inside if we can hitch a ride.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I-I shall go ask them!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh, really. How come?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I-It is not for your benefit. I am only doing this for the
         princess!&quot;

[He runs off.]

Dagger: &quot;Steiner... He was so adamant about going back to the castle
        before... ...... An airship full of barrels like the ones I
        saw at the castle... Steiner was against going... Zidane, is
        this ship really headed for Lindlum?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;No. It'll probably take us straight to Alexandria Castle.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;But why...? Didn't you just say we should get on the ship?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, I know. Trust me!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...Zidane.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What is it, Vivi?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Those dolls they were making underground... Did you think they
      look like me?&quot;
      R1 --&gt; Yes
      R2 --&gt; Not really

      R1 (Zidane): &quot;Maybe a little... But they're just dolls, Vivi.&quot;
      R2 (Zidane): &quot;Not really. They're just dolls, Vivi.&quot;

[The cargo ship's propellers start up.]

Zidane: &quot;It's moving. What the heck is Steiner up to? Alright, we
        have to get on, Dagger.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;On a ship that's not going to Lindblum!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I don't have time to explain. This way!&quot;

[They run to the ladder at the back-end of the ship; Vivi ascends.]

Zidane: &quot;Hurry up! You have nothing to worry about. Hurry, before
        she takes off!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;But...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I'll take you to Lindblum. I promise!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Fine, I'll get on!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It's taking off!&quot;

[The two get on the ladder and Zidane touches Dagger's back-end.]

Dagger: &quot;Aaah!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Ooo, soft...&quot;

[FMV. The &quot;piece of junk&quot; cargo ship takes off on the grassy plains,
heads up towards the Observatory Mountain, and veers off.]

===========================================================
07. Cargo Ship (CS01)
===========================================================

[Everyone makes it safely aboard.]

Zidane: &quot;Come on, it's not like I did it on purpose.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Please, enough.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;There's that royal tone in your voice again. ...Are you
        okay, Vivi?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Feels like I'm going to get sucked into the sky...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Let's go inside, Vivi.&quot;

[She lets Vivi in.]

Dagger: &quot;I trust you, Zidane.&quot;

[...and slams the door in his face.]

Zidane: &quot;I get the feeling she doesn't quite trust me yet... Maybe
        she'll reward me with a kiss or two if I try hard enough.&quot;

[She runs back out.]

Zidane: (Wow, already!?)

Garnet: &quot;Zidane...!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What is it? Something wrong?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;It's Vivi...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Vivi?&quot;

[They go inside, finding Vivi talking to some of the factory-made
black mages with no response. Apparently, they're the crew of the
ship.]

Vivi: &quot;U-Um...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...! Wow, they're alive, and they're moving around!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;U-Um...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So, the mages built in the village bring back the new ones?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Oh, Vivi...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Vivi! Vivi!!!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;U-Um...&quot;

[The black mage crewman walks off.]

Zidane: &quot;Were you able to talk to any of them?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;No... It's like... ...they don't even... ...see me at all...
      I tried... ...again and again... ...but... ...they won't even
      turn around.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Vivi.&quot;

[Vivi doesn't look at him; Zidane turns to Dagger.]

Zidane: &quot;I need to go upstairs for a little bit. I gotta turn the
        ship around before it reaches the castle.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Keep an eye on Vivi, okay?

[Zidane goes up to the deck, and peeks in.]

Zidane: &quot;......&quot;

[Steiner is lying on his knees.]

Steiner: &quot;How could I let this happen...? What am I to do...? I never
         expected things to go so badly... I cannot believe the ship
         took off without the princess! What will I say to Queen
         Brahne...?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What the heck were you doing? You almost took off without us!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;That is because...this ship's crew... ! Why, you! Where is
         the princess!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;In the engine room.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;She is on the ship!? All is well, now. The ship is returning</pre><pre id="faqspan-3">
         to the castle. You will be hanged for the kidnapping of a
         member of the royal family! Enjoy your freedom while you can.&quot;

[Zidane goes into the cockpit. Steiner gazes out across the skyscape
and reflects on his accomplishment.]

Steiner: &quot;At last! Queen Brahne is sure to be pleased. However...the
         princess would have been left behind without the thief's
         aid. I shall petition for a life sentence on his behalf. Yes,
         that would be the honorable thing! But that was because the
         crew wouldn't listen! I must run a background check on them.
         Ah, yes. It is my duty as a knight! Wh-What the--&quot;

[FMV. Zidane steers the ship off its course to Alexandria, and hangs
a direct course away from it. Somewhere in the mountains, a third
Black Waltz watches the cargo ship flitter on by. In the cockpit, the
monkey-tailed hero happily steers the ship.]

Black Mage Crewmember: &quot;......&quot;

[Steiner runs in.]

Black Mage Crewmember: &quot;......&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Y-Y-Y&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What's wrong? Something stuck in your throat?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Y-You insolent fool! Turn the ship around!&quot;

[He tries to punch Zidane, but he jumps out of the way with ease.]

Steiner: &quot;Graaagh!!!&quot;&quot;

[He tries to uppercut Zidane again, but he jumps to an overhanging
pipe, using his tail to grapple.]

Steiner: &quot;I will have your head for that!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, I think we upset them.&quot;

[A bunch of Black Mage crewmembers walk swarm onto the deck.]

Steiner: &quot;But they didn't respond to anything until now... You're the
         one who started this trouble! I apologize! Please wait while
         I take this fool into custody and turn the ship around.
         Wh-What's wrong!?&quot;

[The crewmembers start to leave. On the deck, Dagger and Vivi are
climbing up. Just then, the third Black Waltz descends onto the deck.]

Vivi: &quot;No...!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Vivi! Are you okay!?&quot;

Black Waltz No. 3: &quot;So, No. 2 was defeated by a small child! You are
                   no match against my power! Kwahahaha! Princess,
                   stay there while I eliminate this child!&quot;

[The crewmembers swarm towards the Black Waltz.]

Black Waltz No. 3: &quot;Are you protecting him? ...Nonsense. You are no
                   different from mindless dolls! What can you do? Get
                   out of my way! Do you dare to fight a Black Waltz?
                   I said, get out of my way!&quot;

[FMV. An explosion rips the black mages back and around the deck, as
Vivi watches on in painful silence. Barrels drop out of the sky, and
shatter, dropping more black mages off through the clouds. The Black
Waltz crackles with energy. In the cockpit:]

Steiner: &quot;Wh-What cruelty!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...Aaahhh!&quot;

[Vivi runs to fight.]

Steiner: &quot;Master Vivi, I shall assist you!&quot;

[Steiner follows suit.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, you guys! Dagger!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Y-Yes?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We'll take care of the Black Waltz. You steer the ship.
        Things are gonna get even more dangerous from here on. It's
        not too late to turn back. You can go back to the castle or
        cross South Gate into Lindblum. It's your choice! I'll be with
        you either way! But try not to crash the ship!&quot;

[Zidane runs to fight, too.]

Dagger: &quot;Be careful, Zidane!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I'll be fine!&quot;

[Vivi is confronting the Black Waltz, meanwhile.]

Vivi: &quot;Why...? Why would you do such a thing!? Weren't they your
      friends!?&quot;

Black Waltz No. 3: &quot;You fool. Do I look like some lowly black mage
                   soldier?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Even if they weren't your allies, what you did was
         reprehensible!&quot;

Black Waltz No. 3: &quot;Kwahahaha! Worry not about them: many more are
                   being produced even now!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What are you?&quot;

Black Waltz No. 3: &quot;Ah, the princess's bodyguards have gathered! How
                   very convenient!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Answer me!&quot;

Black Waltz No. 3: &quot;It wouldn't do you any good if I answered, since
                   you're all going to die! Kwahahaha! I will eliminate
                   any who stand in my way!&quot;

[The battle starts, but it's over pretty soon.]

Black Waltz No. 3: &quot;You... You scum...! I exist only to kill!&quot;

[The Black Waltz flies off.]

Steiner: &quot;Just how many Black Waltzes do we have to fight!? This is
         becoming ridiculous!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I think that was the last one.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;How do you know!? Are you...!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;He said 'Waltz,' right? Don't you think No. 3 would be the
        last one?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;?&quot;

Zidane: (I can see South Gate... She's gonna go for it!)&quot;

[Somewhere else, in a ship, Zorn and Thorn watched the fight.]

Zorn: &quot;Did you see that?&quot;
Thorn: &quot;That I did see!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Our enhanced black mages!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;Our black mage enhancements!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;All defeated!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Betrayed us, Steiner did! It is all his fault!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Huh?&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Unstable, the ship becomes! Don't let go of the steering wheel!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;No. 3 is coming back!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;True is it!? Hurray!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;But something is wrong... It's broken!!!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Made its magic too powerful, we did!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;There's nothing we can do now!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Depart shall we!&quot;
Zorn: &quot;We shall depart!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Run away!&quot;
Zorn: &quot;Run away!&quot;

[The two jokers jump out of the ship. Black Waltz No. 3 sits down
in the captain's seat.]

Black Waltz No. 3: &quot;I exist only to kill! I exist only to kill! I
                   exist only to kill! I exist only to kill...!&quot;

[Back at the cargo ship's cockpit:]

Zidane: &quot;Do you see South Gate?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yes!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;South Gate is a huge gate built exclusively for airships,
        but... ...maneuvering through it could be tricky. Do you want
        me to do it, Dagger?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I want to do it on my own...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright... We don't have clearance. They might close the
        gate on us. It should be okay, though. Security was totally
        lax when I came through here on the theater ship. It'll be
        fine, Captain Dagger!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Roger!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...It's old, but the engine's got power.&quot;

[Steiner bursts in.]

Steiner: &quot;We must turn back!!! Princess! Please turn the ship around!
         The Black Waltz is heading straight toward us on an airship!
         He might crash into us!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dagger, Rusty's right! It's headed straight for us! Punch it!
        Go through South Gate!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Don't be ridiculous! What if the gate closes on us!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;There's no way we can outmaneuver him in this cargo ship!
        We'll slide in before the gate closes and shut him out! That's
        our only chance! Rusty! Turn the power up to max with that
        lever over there! Dagger, stay on course no matter what!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Okay!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I know we can make it!&quot;

[FMV. The cargo ship heads for South Gate with the smaller airship
of the Black Waltz heading in. When it gets close, Vivi blasts it with
some fire magic, knocking it off course a bit. Vivi blasts it again
when they zoom through the gate, catching it on fire. It explodes as
they make it out, into Lindblum territory. In the cockpit, Zidane
looks over the engine.]

Zidane: &quot;I think we pushed it a little too hard. Why so silent,
        people? We made it! Come on, cheer up!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;South Gate was badly damaged... It was my fault, wasn't
        it...?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Don't worry about it! They'll fix it up in no time.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;You idiot! The cargo ship was wrecked, we lost all the
         cargo, and South Gate was destroyed! I can't believe I played
         a part in this debacle!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Steiner.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Yes, Princess!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I didn't mean to get you involved... But you saved us. I
        thank you.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Such kind words! I am not worthy! Well, now I've made up
         my mind! I vow to protect you, Princess, until we return to
         the castle!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;How do you feel about that, Dagger? He'll follow you to the
        end of the world.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;It's okay, Zidane. Hey, I can see the main gate of Lindblum!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;That's Lindblum Castle!? How gigantic...!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;The city of Lindblum is inside the castle.)

Zidane: (I guess Dagger and I will go our separate ways once we reach
        Lindblum...)

Steiner: &quot;I see...&quot;

Zidane: (Just when we were beginning to get close...)

Vivi: &quot;...Zidane. Those...black mages and I... Are we...the same...?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;......&quot;

Garnet: &quot;......&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I don't understand, Master Vivi. Just what seemed to be the
         problem...?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...I don't know.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Master Vivi, why would those mages be the same as you? And
         why would it matter if they were...?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Rusty's right!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You're an individual, no matter what happens, Vivi!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;R-Right!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Let's go check out the deck, Vivi! You've gotta see Lindblum
        from above! It's the best! Look, the Falcon's Gate is right
        in front of us!

Vivi: &quot;Why?&quot;

[FMV. The cargo ship goes through Lindblum's Falcon's Gate and into
the town.]

===========================================================
08. Lindblum (LB01)
===========================================================

[The ship docks in the Grand Castle portion.]

Vivi: &quot;Wow! This castle is huge! It's even bigger than Alexandria
      Castle!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah. They don't call it Lindblum Grand Castle to nothing.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;An indoor airship dock! This is truly amazing...! Even Her
         Majesty's Red Rose would easily fit in here.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Dagger, you don't look too impressed. Have you been here
        before?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yes, I came here a few times when I was little... I haven't
        been here since my father passed away.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Here comes the welcome committee.&quot;

[Three Lindblum guards approach.]

Elite Guard: &quot;That's a really old airship.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Greetings. I am Princess Garnet Til Alexandros. I humbly
        request an audience with Regent Cid.&quot;

Elite Guard: &quot;You must be kidding! No member of the royal family, let
             alone a princess, would ever ride in such a shabby
             airship. And look at the company you're keeping.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;How dare you accuse the princess of lying!? The princess was
         forced to come here under extreme circumstances!&quot;

Elite Guard: &quot;Then show me some kind of proof of your royal heritage.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Very well...&quot;

[She shows her pendant to the guard.]

Elite Guard: &quot;This pendant... Is it a Falcon Claw!? ...No. The shape
             is a little different. Call Minister Artania!&quot;

[A guard leaves and Steiner turns to Zidane.]

Steiner: &quot;If you weren't such a filthy-looking oaf, they would not
         be suspicious of us!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, I'm not the idiot with the loud voice, and the dirty,
        rusty armor.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;WHAT!!!?&quot;

[The minister appears.]

Minister Artania: &quot;What is going on?&quot;

Elite Guard: &quot;Sir, we have unknown visitors who wish to see the regent.
             And one of them is carrying a pendant that looks like a
             Falcon Claw.&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;! You are dismissed. I'll talk care of this.&quot;

Elite Guard: &quot;Yes, sir!&quot;

[The guards leave.]

Dagger: &quot;Uncle Artania!&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;It's good to see you, Princess. Please follow me.
                  The regent is waiting.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;?&quot;

[They get on an elevator.]

Minister Artania: &quot;Lindblum Castle has three levels, all connected by
                  this lift. From the base level, which lies below the
                  Mist, you can take a trolley to the harbor and the
                  back gate. Ships hardly arrive at the harbor anymore
                  since travel by air has become so popular. The Mist
                  poses great danger, so we've sealed off everything.
                  Just above the Base Level is the Mid Level. You can
                  ride the air cab from the Mid Level to go to town.
                  The Upper Level contains the royal chambers and
                  conference room. Access to that level is restricted,
                  because the regent himself resides there.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, Dagger, what's Regent Cid like? I lived in Lindblum for
        a while, but I've never met him.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Regent Cid is very wise. He always thinks ahead. He may seem
        a bit odd at times, but he is very dependable. He and my father
        were best friends... ...I wonder if he will listen to what I
        have to say...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Don't wory. We're not leaving until he does.&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;We will arrive at the Upper Level shortly.&quot;

[The party goes into the throne room.]

Minister Artania: &quot;Sire, Princess Garnet of Alexandria wishes to see
                  you.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess, is something wrong?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;The regent isn't here, and I don't know who... Take a look
        at the throne.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;? What in the world...?&quot;

[A creature peeks from behind the throne.]

Creature: &lt;Gwok-gwok.&gt; &lt;Gwok-gwok!&gt; &quot;Greetings!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;!!! OG...!!! OGLOP!!!&quot;

[He punches the advancing oglop into the throne's back.&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;Sire!&quot;

[The creature appears to be the regent.]

Regent Cid: &quot;What!?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;!?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Wh...!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dagger, what's wrong? Why aren't you talking to-- GEEZ!
        That's an oglop!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Wow... Even the oglops are big in Lindblum.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;What is the meaning of this!? How dare you greet the princess
         like this!? Get that repulsive bug off the throne immediately,
         and call the regent!&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;Please, settle down! You ARE before the regent!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;What!? Enough of your nonsense!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Steiner, stand down. I remember that moustache. Is that
        really you, Uncle Cid?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Yes. Greetings, all &lt;gwok&gt;. I am Cid Fabool, Regent of
            Lindblum. I knew it was you--I recognized your pendant's
            description; it's so much like my 'Falcon Claw.' I'm
            delighted to see you again, Garnet. You have truly &lt;gwok&gt;
            become a fine lady. I, on the other hand...&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;Allow me to explain. About six months ago, someone
                  snuck into the castle and attacked the regent in his
                  sleep. Unfortunately, we were too late... The regent
                  had been transformed into an oglop, and his wife,
                  Lady Hilda, was abducted.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;My goodness...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Whoever pulled this off had to be highly skilled, like me.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Hmph! I bet it was you!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;That's not possible.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;How can you be so sure? Do you know who we are?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Of course. I may be a bug &lt;gwok&gt;, but I am still the
            ruler of Lindblum.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Uncle Cid, I appreciate you seeing me on such short notice.
        I desperately need to speak to you about my mother.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;That's what I figured. But I'm sure it can wait 'til
            tomorrow. Why don't you all get some rest for today?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;It is time for lunch. Please follow me.&quot;

[The rest of the party goes to eat; Zidane hits the town by himself
to find some dining. He stops by a cafe.]

Zidane: &quot;I can't stand the food at the castle. It's way too high-class
        for my tastes. How can anyone get full on that stuff? The
        cheap food here is a lot better. Today's special is... Soup du
        Silence. Not bad.&quot;

[He heads inside.]

Zidane: &quot;Yo, Pops. I'll have the stupid special.&quot;

Bobo: &quot;Who said that!? Zidane... I figured it was you.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;How've you been?&quot;

Bobo: &quot;Alright, I guess... Have a seat. Your soup'll be ready in a
      minute.&quot;

[A waitress stands by Zidane.]

Lilian: &quot;Do you mind? You're standing in everyone's way.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wow... Hey.&quot;

Lilian: &quot;Yeah? Do you want a drink?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;How about you and me go for a cruise on an airship?&quot;

Lilian: &quot;Really!? An airship!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Sounds like you've never been on one. You know, Lindblum is
        quite a sight from high above.&quot;

[A woman in red at the bar speaks.]

Woman at the Counter: &quot;Hey, monkey-tail, you're disturbing the other
                      customers.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What the--you've got a tail, too, rat-face!&quot;

Woman at the Counter: &quot;Rat-face...After I finish my drink, I'm gonna
                      kick your butt.&quot;

Bobo: &quot;Hey, Zidane, take it outside.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;!!!&quot;

Woman at the Counter: &quot;Long time, Zidane.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey! What's up!? Wait a minute...&quot;

Woman at the Counter: &quot;You forgot my name?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;No, I remember. You're Helga, right?&quot;

Woman at the Counter: &quot;Wrong.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Christine?&quot;

Woman at the Counter: &quot;No!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Oh yeah! You used to live next door to me. How's it
        going...Ratchel? Man, you've really gotten...big.&quot;

Woman at the Counter: &quot;You nasty little--&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Come on. I'm just kiddin'. You know I never forget a pretty
        girl's name.&quot;

[The player can name the woman in red. Default: Freya.]

Zidane: &quot;So, how've you been, Freya?&quot;

Freya: &quot;...Same old Zidane.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;How long has it been?&quot;

Freya: &quot;About 3 years.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, did you ever find out anything about your boyfriend?&quot;

Freya: &quot;No...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So... What brings you to Lindblum?&quot;

Freya: &quot;The Festival of the Hunt. What else? It's a good opportunity
       to test my skills.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh... Well, I'm sure you'll find him someday.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Aren't you participating?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Nah. I think I'll pass.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Lazy bum.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Are you ever gonna go back?&quot;

Freya: &quot;I have no reason to return to Burmecia. There is nothing
       there for me anymore.&quot;

[The view changes to the Lindblum throne room, where the regent and
the princess are talking alone.]

Regent Cid: &quot;So, how is the queen? Is she still as vibrant as ever?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yes, but... Since Father died, Mother has been acting rather
        strangely...&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;I'm not surprised &lt;gwok-gwok&gt;. They loved each other so
             much...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;We haven't spoken much lately. Also, a suspicious man has
        been prowling around the castle. I don't know what's going
        on anymore... I fear that she might be planning something
        terrible. I've brough this matter to everybody's attention,
        but no one has taken me seriously. They all think I'm
        distraught over losing Father...&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;I understand why you are so eager. I'm happy that you
            came to me for help.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;At this point, I think you're the only person Mother will
        listen to... When I heard that Lindblum's theater ship was
        coming to Alexandria, I decided to sneak on board and come
        here no matter what. I just never expected the crew to kidnap
        me...&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;It was me... I was the one who ordered Tantalus to kidnap you.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;!?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;I once promised your father &lt;gwok&gt;, that should anything
            happen, I would protect you. We've known about the
            disturbances in Alexandria for some time. But had we acted
            directly, it would've started a war. So, I asked Baku for
            help. He and I go way back. The play was the perfect cover
            to enter Alexandria and get you out. No one would suspect
            Lindblum was behind it. We were &lt;gwok&gt; forced to take
            action, because we knew Alexandria would never seek our
            help. I'm relieved we were able to get you here.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;At the Village of Dali, we saw numerous black mages. They
        looked like golems, controlled by some powerful magic. On top
        of that, they were being created under Alexandria's supervision.
        I don't know how they're related to Vivi, but if Mother is
        planning to use them for war...&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;We won't let that happen. Even if she were to command an
            army of black mages, she won't make a move as long as we
            have our airship fleet. Don't worry &lt;gwok-gwok&gt;. Everything
            will be fine.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I'm so sorry, Uncle.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Now, now, come on. Don't be so formal. I'm helping you
            because I am your Uncle Cid, not because I am the regent
            of Lindblum.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Thank you so much.&quot;

[The two go to an empty airship hangar.]

Dagger: &quot;What is this place...?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;The heart and soul of Lindblum: our airship dock. This
            is Dock No. 1, where we conduct our research &lt;gwok&gt;.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;But...where are the airships?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Lonely, isn't it...? We had a new airship model in here
            about 6 months ago. It was our latest creation; it didn't
            require Mist to fly.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;The man who attacked you--was he the one who ran off with it?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Good guess, but no... Actually... I met a lovely lady at
            the pub...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;...Um?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;When Hilda found out about my little affair, she used her
            magic and turned me into an oglop. Then she stormed off in
            the new airship, which I named Hilda Garde. Pretty ironic,
            eh? ...... She hasn't been back since &lt;gwok&gt;. I've been
            working on Hilda Garde 2, but it hasn't been going too
            well. My mind just isn't the same as an oglop. I'm
            hopeless... But that doesn't mean I can't help you. I'll
            do my best for Alexandria.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Thank you... But with South Gate badly damaged, I don't know
        how we can get to Alexandria...&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Don't worry. South Gate is being repaired as we speak.
            Once the repairs are finished, we'll go to Alexandria.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yes. I'm sure Mother will finally open her eyes to the truth.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;......&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Uncle, is something wrong?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Huh? No, I was just thinking...about how the theater ship
            crashed. Baku sure has good men working under him...&quot;

[The scene ends. The next day, Zidane wakes up in the hotel and Vivi
comes into his room after a bit.]

Vivi: &quot;Good morning.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You're up early.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Lindblum is a really busy place. I've never seen this many
      people before. I wonder where people go when the wanna be
      alone...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Lindblum has always been like this. People come here from all
        over the world. Some of them come here to become airship
        engineers, sculptors, actors...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Wow...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I don't even remember why I came here my first time. Before
        I knew it, I was living here with my Tantalus brothers.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Do they still live here?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah. Our hideout is in the Theater District. I'm gonna go
        there right now. Do you wanna come along?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Um, that's okay. I'm gonna go look around town.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Okay. Then I'll give you a little tour.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...No, that's okay. I can go by myself.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Ohhh...okay... Go find yourself a cute girl, alright?&quot;

[The third &quot;Teach me, Mogster!&quot; ATE plays and after sitting through
another ATE (Vivi's Shopping) later, Zidane heads to the hideout in
the Theater District. It's empty, though...]

Zidane: &quot;I figured there wouldn't be anybody here... It looks like no
        one's been here for a while. What to do, what to do...?&quot;

[The bell starts to ring.]

Zidane: &quot;Geez. It's that late already... I wonder what Dagger's doing.&quot;

[An ATE &quot;What can I do?&quot; plays. Two kids run in after its over.]

Bunce: &quot;There he is!&quot;

Lucella: &quot;I told you he'd be here.&quot;

Bunce: &quot;Why didn't you tell us that you were back? We're in Tantalus,
       too, you know.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What?&quot;

Lucella: &quot;Yeah. Uncle Baku said if we find some treasure, we can be
         in Tantalus, too.&quot;

Bunce: &quot;Yeah. Check this out.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wow, those are trick sparrow's wings! That sure is some
        treasure you found, alright!&quot;

Lucella: &quot;Yay!&quot;

Bunce: &quot;Yipee! So, did the plan work?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Yeah. Princess Garnet is at the castle.&quot;

Lucella: &quot;Really!? Wow... So, what's she like? Is she cute?&quot;

Bunce: &quot;Did you ask her out yet?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;No... I think she's pretty busy. Plus, she's a princess and
        I'm a...you know, so...I don't know.&quot;

Lucella: &quot;I bet she misses you.&quot;

Bunce: &quot;Yeah. You should go see her.&quot;

Lucella: &quot;Good luck!&quot;

Bunce: &quot;See ya!&quot;

[They leave.]

Zidane: &quot;I wonder if she got to talk to Cid... Maybe I should go see her...&quot;

[Zidane heads to the Grand Castle, finding Steiner in the guest room.]

Zidane: &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;You! What have you done with the princess!? Where is she!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Whoa, take it easy. I just got here.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;The princess is gone! She was supposed to stay in this room.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Maybe she went for a little walk.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;How can you be so calm!? This is a very serious matter!
         Have you forgotten all the danger she faced just to get
         here!? What if something terrible happens to her!? What am I
         doing here!? I must go find her! Out of my way!&quot;

[Steiner runs out with Zidane following soon after.]

Zidane: &quot;I wonder where she went...&quot;

[He walks a little further, hearing a familiar song being sung.]

Zidane: &quot;That song... I've heard it somewhere before. That sweet
        voice... It's Dagger. She's upstairs.&quot;

[Zidane is rebuffed as he goes to the elevator, though:]

Soldier: &quot;Sorry. Only authorized personnel can use the lift.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Man, I've gotta get past this guy somehow. Maybe if I
        disguise myself as a guard, he'll let me through.&quot;

[Zidane finds a sleeping guard upstairs.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, wake up!&quot;

Sleepy Soldier: &quot;...Huh?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I just saw a suspicious character wandering around!&quot;

Sleepy Soldier: &quot;WHAT!? Wh-Where!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Upstairs. Follow me.&quot;

[The guard follows and starts to head away.]

Zidane: &quot;No! In here!&quot;

Sleepy Soldier: &quot;Huh!?&quot;

[The two run into the guest room.]

Sleepy Soldier: &quot;Alright, you bastard! Show yourself! Hey what are
                you doing!?&quot;

[Zidane emerges in the guard's clothes.]

Zidane: &quot;That was easy. I should be able to get on the lift now.&quot;

[Zidane goes up to the rooftop and finds Dagger. FMV: Zidane sees
Dagger singing next to some pigeons, and she sees him from across
the way.]

Zidane: &quot;Nice song.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;How did you get up here? This is a restricted area.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Come on, I do this for a living.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;...Oh yeah. You're a member of Tantalus. It must've been
        easy for you. ......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...? Whew... What a view... Hey! There's a telescope! Let's
        go check it out. Come on.&quot;

[They go up to the telescope.]

Zidane: &quot;Hmmm...&quot;

[Zidane can look around at the sights:

Aerbs Mountains ----&gt; &quot;Those are the mountains that surround
                      Burmecia. I guess the best way to get there is
                      through the cavern at the base.&quot;

Marshland ----&gt; &quot;There's probably a lot of weird things living there.
                Maybe I should check it out sometime.

South Gate ----&gt; &quot;Oh, there's South Gate. I wonder if they've started
                 repairing it... It'll probably take a while to fix
                 everything.&quot;

Ceebell River ----&gt; &quot;That river flows right by South Gate. You can
                    get to the gate by walking along the river.&quot;

??? Forest ----&gt; &quot;Hey, there's a chocobo. Maybe I can catch a chocobo
                 in that forest.&quot;

Aerbs Mountains ----&gt; &quot;Alexandria is beyond those mountains. I bet
                      they're looking for us.&quot;

[Once Zidane's found all the locations:]

Dagger: &quot;Let me see.&quot; [She looks.]

Zidane: &quot;How's the view?&quot;

Dagger: (...I've made so much trouble for everyone... Uncle Cid knew
        everything... That's why he asked Tantalus to get me out of
        Alexandria. No matter how hard I try, I'm always one step
        behind in everything... I'm so helpless...)

Zidane: &quot;...What's wrong?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane... Why did you help me come here--to Lindblum? ...Is
        it because your boss ordered you to?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I just wanted to help you. That's all. The boss didn't agree
        with me... ...so I ended up leaving the band.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Really!? I'm sorry.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Don't worry about it. It isn't the first time I've left.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Oh...um... How were you planning to abduct me?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We were gonna put you to sleep with sleeping weed, then
        kidnap you. It's mostly used for kids, but a big dose can
        knock out an adult just as easily.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I guess you didn't need it, since I came along on my own.
        Hey... Would you mind giving me some? I've had a hard time
        sleeping lately.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Um, I don't think that's a good idea. You might get
        addicted. Maybe all you need is some company, eh?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Oh, please. Do you think I'm that naive?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Heh, heh. Can't blame me for trying.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;U-Um... Th-That song... Were you singing it in the Village
        of Dali?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;...Yes. So, you were up that night.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What is that song, anyway?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;...I don't know. I can't even remember where I learned it.
        I sing it whenever I feel sad or lonely... For some reason,
        it comforts me and reminds me that I'm not alone.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I guess it's a mystical song... Let me hear it again.&quot;

[She starts singing, and the view changes to Steiner, who's now
looking at armor in Dragoos' shop (the same armor, I might add, that
Zidane calls &quot;cheesy&quot; crap).]

Steiner: &quot;Hmm... I never expected to find such fine armor in a place
         like this.&quot;

Customer: &quot;Yes, I'll buy that one, too. Who knows when that Brahne
          will start another war...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;WHAT!? The queen would never start a war! You dare speak
         ill of the queen!?&quot;

Customer: &quot;Who the hell are you?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I'm a......an armor collector!&quot;

Customer: &quot;Oh. Well, in that case, can you recommend some good armor?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I...I must go!&quot;

[Steiner leaves and the view changes to a street in the Business
District, where a little hippo kid is playing with figurines.]

Phillipo: &quot;GO, Knights of Pluto! Yeah!!!&quot;

Poncho: &quot;What are those things? They look so stupid. I'm gonna take
        Cid's airships and destroy them.&quot;

Phillipo: &quot;HEY, cut it out! YOU BROKE MY KNIGHT! I'm gonna go tell
          your mom!!!&quot;

Poncho: &quot;No, come on!!!&quot;

[The two kids run off just as Vivi walks by.]

Vivi: &quot;'Royal Action Figures'...? Those black mages were like toys...
      being controlled by someone...&quot;

[The view changes to Freya, who's leaping around in the Theater
District. She stops on the Tantalus hideout's roof.]

Freya: &quot;The sky looks ominous... Something's about to happen. Sir
       Fratley, where are you...? I need you...&quot;

[The view changes again to the empty airship hangar. The oglop regent
stands at a drawing board.]

Regent Cid: &quot;Okay! It should work now.&quot;

Engineer Zebolt: &quot;Sire, it's no good.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;What!?&quot;

Engineer Zebolt: &quot;We can't stabilize the engine system. It can't run
                 for more than 10 minutes.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Darn it... My mind hasn't been the same since I became
            an oglop...&quot;

[The view changes back to Zidane and Dagger.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, Dagger. So when do you wanna go on that airship cruise?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...!? (What am I thinking!? I asked the girl at the...)
        Never mind.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Well...it sounds like you've asked the wrong girl.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wait. I-I can explain.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Why bother? Go have a wonderful time.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh, man... Okay, how about this? If I get first place in
        tomorrow's hunting festival, you and me'll go out on a date!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;How does that have anything to do with me?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Come on. Pleaaase.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;...Fine.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Okay, it's a date!&quot;

[Zidane runs off.]

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

[Somewhere, preparations for the Festival are in full swing, and a
large cage shakes full of monsters in one of the residential areas.]

Officer: &quot;It may be tradition, but this is a dreadful festival. So
         many lives lost each year, especially because of him...&quot;

Captain: &quot;Hardly. The festival is a test of manhood. I tingle with
         excitement every year.&quot;

Soldier: &quot;This is the last carraige. All the preparations for the
         Festival of the Hunt are complete.&quot;

Officer: &quot;Very good. Now we wait for the signal.&quot;

Captain: &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;

[The carriage opens and a flock of Fangs runs out.]

Officer: &quot;Whoa!&quot;

[The Soldier &amp; Officer flee. A fang licks its chops at the Captain.]

Captain: &quot;......&quot;

[The view changes to another area.]

Soldier: &quot;The fangs have been freed.&quot;

Officer: &quot;What!? We haven't even received the minister's authorization!&quot;

Soldier: &quot;We believe that they're going to release 'him' any minute.&quot;

Officer: &quot;Alright, release the mus before they let him loose. Hurry!&quot;

[The two run off as the squirrel-like mus scamper out. The view goes
to a large cage with a walkway over it somewhere.]

Voice: &quot;All is ready!&quot;

Soldier: &quot;Alright. Standby!&quot;

Breeder: &quot;This year's specimen is perfect. Nothing can stop him! Ha
         ha ha! What power!&quot;

Soldier: &quot;Hey, make him stop! It's too early to let him loose!&quot;

Breeder: &quot;How? I have no control over him.&quot;

Soldier: &quot;Dammit! Open the gate at once! The gate's gonna fall apart!&quot;

Breeder: &quot;GO, ZAGHNOL!&quot;

[The gigantic swine stampedes into the city. Up in the Grand Castle's
guest room, Vivi, Steiner, and Dagger all stand around. Freya is there
as well.]

Vivi: (Where's Zidane...?)

Steiner: &quot;Please, Princess. You might actually enjoy it.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Okay...&quot;

Freya: (I wonder if Zidane has improved his skills...)

[Zidane enters.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.&quot;

Elite Guard: &quot;Alright, let's begin.&quot;

Narrative: = Festival of the Hunt =
           Hunters, on your mark! Ferocious beasts swarm about the
           castle town! The bigger the catch, the higher the score!
           The time limit is 12 minutes. Use air cabs to go to other
           districts. Once you lose in a battle, you will be forced to
           retire. The winner will be crowned Master Hunter and
           receive the hunter's reward. Who will come out on top!?

Elite Guard: &quot;What do you wish for your hunter's reward?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I'll go with Gil all the way!&quot;

Freya: &quot;I'll take an Add-on.&quot;

Elite Guard: &quot;And you, Mr. Vivi?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;WHAT!? I never signed up!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I thought you would do pretty well, so I signed you up. Don't
        worry. With your black magic, it'll be a piece of cake.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I...I don't know...&quot;

Freya: &quot;That was very inconsiderate of you, Zidane.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh! (How about this? If you win, I'll fix you up for a date
        with Dagger.)&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Me and the princess!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;(SHHH! Keep it down!)&quot;

Steiner: &quot;What was that!? You just mentioned the princess. What evil
         deeds are you plotting now!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It's nothing, right, Vivi?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Y-Yeah.&quot;

Elite Guard: &quot;So, what would you like for your reward?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Oh, um... I'll take a Card.&quot;

Elite Guard: &quot;Okay. Gil, an Add-on, and...a Card. The festival will
             begin shortly. You all have different starting points.
             Hunter Zidane will start in the Theater District, Hunter
             Freya will start in the Industrial District, and Hunter
             Vivi will start in the Business District.&quot;

[Everyone but Zidane and the guard leaves.]

Elite Guard: &quot;Your starting point is the Theater District. You'll
             need to take an air cab to get there.

===========================================================
09. Festival of the Hunt (09)
===========================================================

NOTE: This dialogue is separated so there isn't one big block of
      all-Lindblum stuff. No one wants a wall of text, right? ;p

[Steiner and Garnet take their spectator's view on the bridge above
where the Zaghnol was kept caged up.]

Steiner: &quot;Such rudeness! Princess, they are treating you like a
         commoner!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Oh, hush. We get a great view from here.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Hmm, you're right. I can see the entire town. Princess,
         look! Master Vivi is also participating!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I can't believe it. He seemed to reluctant earlier.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;MASTER VIVI!!! THE PRINCESS AND I ARE ROOTING FOR YOU!!!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;COME ON, VIVI!!! YOU CAN DO IT!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;No! Master Vivi!

Dagger: &quot;Look out! Oh, gosh! I can't watch anymore!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;YOU CAN'T WIN JUST BY RUNNING! A GOOD OFFENSE IS THE BEST
         DEFENSE! ATTACK! You can't lose to that monkey Zidane! YES!
         THAT'S IT! NOW'S YOUR CHANCE! ONE MORE TIME! VIVI, BEHIND
         YOU! YES! GO!&quot;

[The view changes to Zidane, arriving in the Theater District. As he
fights, different participants and their scores are given, in this
format:]

______ leads with ___ points!

[The participants (as far as I know) consist of:]

-Lani
-Zidane
-Freya
-Ivan
-Genero
-Vivi
-Belna
-The Strange Gourmand

[When the contest ends, narrative says:]

The time is up! The winner is..._____! ___ points!

[Afterwards, there is a ceremony at the GC Throne room.]

Regent Cid: &quot;That was marvelous! All of you!&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;____ points! Congratulations!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;We grand you the 'Master Hunter' and your reward.&quot;

[They give the winner the reward. If Freya wins:]

Zidane: &quot;My hat's off to you, Freya. I don't know how you racked up
        so many points.&quot;

Freya: &quot;The fruits of my training, I suppose.

[If Vivi wins:]

Steiner: &quot;Well done, Master Vivi!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Thanks... I can't believe I won.&quot;

[If Zidane wins:]

Vivi: &quot;Congratulations, Zidane!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Thanks!&quot;

[No matter who wins, the following happens:]

Voice: &quot;Regent...&quot;

[A rat soldier enters, wounded.]

Burmecian Soldier: &quot;Please forgive my intrusion... I bring urgent
                   news... from our king.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;The king of Burmecia?&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;(Sire, you must not let him see you like this!)&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;(Take a good look at him. An injury has blinded him.)
            Continue.&quot;

Burmecian Soldier: &quot;Our kingdom is being attacked by some unknown
                   force! We are severely outmatched! Please send
                   reinforcements immediately!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;!!!&quot;

Burmecian Soldier: &quot;The enemy looks like an army of mages wearing...
                   steeple-crowned hats.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;The king and I are old friends. We will send reinforcements
            to Burmecia immediately.&quot;

Burmecian Soldier: &quot;Thank you, Regent! The kind...and all of Burmecia
                   will be most grateful! I must...return now... ...Ugh.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Take him to the infirmary!&quot;

Freya: &quot;It's too late. He's gone... It's a miracle he even made it
       this far. I can't believe this is happening...&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;This is a problem... Because of the Festival, there
                  are hardly any men left in the castle. It will take
                  time to mobilize.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;We have no choice... Call back the 4th aerial division
            patrolling the border.&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;But if we recall the 4th, we will lose our eyes
                  over Alexandria.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;&lt;Gwok-gwok&gt; Burmecia is our ally. We must help them.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Steple-crowned hats... They might be black mages, like Vivi.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;It can't be...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Could it be Mother...!?&quot;

Freya: &quot;I must go now. I cannot sit and wait for the reinforcements.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I'm coming with you.&quot;

Freya: &quot;No. This doesn't concern you.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What's this, I'm a stranger all of a sudden!? I'm not gonna
        sit back and watch your home get destroyed, alright?&quot;

Freya: &quot;...Thank you, Zidane.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Um, c-can I come, too? I wanna find out who they really are.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Sure.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Alright then. Let's go to Burmecia.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess! This is a foreign matter! It has nothing to do
         with us!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Steiner is right. We don't know if Alexandria is involved.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;But if black mages are involved... Zidane, you know what I'm
        talking about.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;......&quot;

Dagger: &quot;If Mother is behind this, I'll make her stop! I promise!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...I think you should stay here.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We don't know what to expect there.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I've already faced great danger coming here! What's the
        difference!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dagger, this is war. A lot of people are gonna die.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I know that!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...How did you feel when you saw that Burmecian soldier die,
        just now?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;...I felt sad, of course.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Just sad? Weren't you scared, too? Obviously, you haven't
        realized how dangerous this is gonna be... You could get
        killed. This is no time to be convincing your mother of
        anything.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;But...&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Now's not the time to argue.&quot;

Freya: &quot;He's right. We must head to Burmecia at once. Will you open
       the Dragon's Gate?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Of course. If you're going by foot, leaving from that
            gate is the best way. Let us eat while we &lt;gwok&gt; wait for
            the gate to open.&quot;

[The party goes down to the dining hall later, finding a lavish meal.]

Vivi: &quot;Yay! I'm so hungry!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;The Festival of the Hunt feast is one of our oldest
            traditions. It began well over five centuries ago. It is
            customary to eat everything with your hands, so go on,
            before it gets cold.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Thank you, Uncle.&quot;

[Everyone starts eating except Dagger and Freya.]

Vivi: &quot;Mmmm! It's so good!&quot;

Freya: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Let's just eat. We can't do anything until the gate opens.&quot;

Freya: &quot;...You're right.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, not bad!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;This is wonderful! Princess, how is everything? Why aren't
         you eating?&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Oh... I'm sorry. You're right. Everything is so delicious.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Indeed, it is. Especially this beef. It is superb!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Oh, I'm so full. I'm getting sleepy now...&quot;

[Cid, Freya and Vivi all fall over in a deep sleep.]

Steiner: &quot;What the--THE FOOD IS POISONED!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dagger...?&quot;

[Zidane falls over, too.]

Steiner: &quot;How could I be so careless!!! Ugh... I'm starting to feel
         sick... F-Forgive me, Princess. I should have tasted it for
         poison...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;That's impossible. There shouldn't be any in your dish.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;What...? Now that you mention it, I feel just fine. !!!
         How did you know!? Princess! You didn't!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;It's not poison. It's just a medicinal herb Zidane gave me.
        Believe me, this was not what I had planned. Steiner, I have
        to make my own decisions... I had no choice. Uncle Cid would
        never let me leave the castle.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;That is because he is concerned about you!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I understand that, but--&quot;

Steiner: &quot;No, you don't understand...! War is a terrible thing! You
         must never experience it like I have. I'm sorry, Princess. I
         cannot follow any orders that might put your life in danger.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;...What if Alexandria is behind the attack on Burmecia? It
        could lead to war between the three great nations. Many
        innocent people will die... As the princess of Alexandria,
        there must be something I can do. I have to help Mother... I
        don't want to see anything happen to her...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;...... ...Very well. Princess, I will follow you wherever
         you choose.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Thank you. Let's go before everyone wakes up. I'm sorry,
        Zidane. Come on.&quot;

[Dagger and Steiner leave. In his sleep, Zidane asks:]

Zidane: &quot;Dagger... Where are you going...?&quot;

[Later on, the groggy party wakes up.]

Freya: &quot;It must've been some sort of sleeping medicine.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It was sleeping weed.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;We've been had...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I gave her some because she said she was having problems
        sleeping.&quot;

Freya: &quot;I'm impressed. There's more to her than meets the eye.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Damn, what the heck is she thinking!? Maybe she's heading
        to Burmecia.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Then you might still be able to catch up with her.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Vivi, wake up! We're going to Burmecia!&quot;

Freya: &quot;Let's head for Gizamaluke's Grotto. Once we pass through the
       grotto, we will be in Burmecia.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;You can leave from the Dragon's Gate located on the
            Base Level.&quot;

[The party goes down the elevator and leaves through Serpent's Gate.]

===========================================================
10. Qu's Marsh (QU01)
===========================================================

[The party wanders into the marsh and finds a strange creature by
the pond, looking for frogs. Zidane catches one for it.]

Qu: &quot;You got frog! Frogs very good! Mmmm!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Who the heck are you?&quot;

Qu: &quot;Me?&quot;

[You can name the strange Qu. Default: Quina]

Zidane: &quot;Quina, do you want this frog?&quot;

Quina: &quot;Yes, yes! Yes, yes!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Alright. Here.&quot;

Quina: &quot;Yaaay! Mine, mine!&quot;

[Just then, a man in a chef's hat walks over.]

Quale: &quot;You pathetic, Quina. Can't even feed yourself.&quot;

[They all go back to Quale's house, deep in the marsh.]
</pre><pre id="faqspan-4">
Quale: &quot;Can't master art of eating just chasing frogs, Quina.&quot;

Quina: &quot;But, Master, frogs very good! Frogs here best! Better than
       Alexandria's.&quot;

Quale: &quot;Quina, you in darkness. Need some light. World big place.
       Many many foods. Alexandria just one kingdom. You need go out
       more, eat other food.&quot;

Quina: &quot;Go out into world...? Sound scary. Are there yummier frogs
       outside?&quot;

Quale: &quot;Of course! Many good frogs! All Qus love frogs the best.
       Eating frogs is key to growth. Qu marshes exist all over the
       world. Go eat frogs in other marshes. I promise, you get much
       learning. Traveler, please show Quina the world. Anywhere with
       good food.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You want me to take him with us?&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Why not
        R2 --&gt; Forget it

        R1 (Quina): &quot;Will I find yummier frogs outside?&quot;

           Zidane: &quot;There is plenty of stuff in the world that
                   tastes better than frogs.&quot;

           Quina: &quot;Really really!? Okay, I go with you!&quot;

           Quale: &quot;......&quot;
           Zidane: &quot;......&quot;

        R2 (Quina): &quot;It okay, Master. I stay, eat frogs here.&quot;

           Quale: &quot;Lazy fool... Traveler, if you change your mind,
                  take Quina with you.&quot;

           Zidane: &quot;...I'll think about it.&quot;

[After meeting Quale in his house, the party leaves. Vivi turns
back around.]

Vivi: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What's up, Vivi?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Um... That man looks exactly like my grandpa.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Your grandfather? Who, that Quale guy?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Yeah... Maybe he knows my grandpa. I'm gonna go talk to him,
      Zidane.&quot;

[They both walk back inside.]

Quale: What wrong? Something on my face?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Um... Do you know a man named Quan?&quot;

Quale: &quot;! ...I not know that bigot!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Grandpa Quan was a bit strange, but... How do you know him?&quot;

Quale: &quot;I-I no can answer.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Grandpa Quan looks exactly like you, Mr. Quale...&quot;

Quale: &quot;Of course. We from same tribe.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You really don't know him?&quot;

Quale: &quot;No! I not know this Quan!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Honestly...? That's too bad... Let's go, Vivi.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Okay...&quot;

[With their newly-found party member, they leave the marsh.]

===========================================================
11. Chocobo's Forest (CF01)
===========================================================

[The party stumbles into the forest in the King Ed Plains, finding
a moogle riding on a chocobo.]

Moogle: &quot;Kupooo!!! I'm Mene, master of this forest! This chocobo is
        my friend, kupo. His name is Choco.&quot;

Choco: &quot;Kweeeh!&quot;

Mene: &quot;And this is...&quot;

[The words &quot;Chocobo's Forest&quot; come on the screen.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, did a cute girl with long hair come by here?&quot;

Mene: &quot;No. But ugly girl came by here.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh... I guess she didn't come this way. Maybe she's heading
        toward Burmecia after all... I'd better get movin'.&quot;

Mene: &quot;You in a hurry, kupo?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, sort of.&quot;

Mene: &quot;Then take Choco. You won't run into monsters if you ride
      Choco. Choco, come here.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It's okay. Don't force him...&quot;

Mene: &quot;No. If Choco hates, Choco runs away. Choco, come on! Kupo!!!&quot;

Choco: &quot;Kweeeh!!!&quot;

[Choco runs out of the forest.]

Mene: &quot;Fine. I'll just get to the point, kupo. These are Gysahl
      Greens! You can call Choco outside the forest with these. Find
      chocobo footprints near the forest, kupo. Use Gysahl Greens
      there, and Choco will come. Choco likes you, kupo. You call, and
      he'll come! Please train Choco! Make him strong! Come back to
      this forest after you call him in the world. I'll tell you a big
      secret, kupo.&quot;

[Zidane catches Choco outside and brings him back.]

Mene: &quot;Choco! How are you, kupo?&quot;

Choco: &quot;Kweeeh!!!&quot;

===========================================================
12. Gizamaluke's Grotto (GZ01)
===========================================================

[They find two dead soldiers at the cavern entrance.]

Freya: &quot;No...! Come on! Get up! Dammit! Say something!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh, man...&quot;

Freya: &quot;The black mages! Who are they!?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;U-Um...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It's okay. You didn't do anything.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Vivi, aren't they your-- !!! The king might be in danger!
       Come on!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I sure hope Dagger didn't come here... Let's go.&quot;

[Inside, they find a soldier still clinging to life.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, are you alright!?&quot;

Burmecian Soldier: &quot;...Black mages... Couldn't do anything.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We're here to help. We're on our way to Burmecia.&quot;

Burmecian Soldier: &quot;Ugh... I'm done for. Take this bell, and... go
                   to Burmecia... The black mages... took our
                   bells... The king's in...palace... Please
                   protec...&quot;

[The soldier dies.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey!!! I'll protect him. Don't worry.&quot;

[He takes the bell and rings it by the door.]

Narrative: The bell in your hand and the door bell are ringing!
           The bell in your hand shattered...&quot;

[In the next room, black mages are still attacking soldiers.]

Black Mage 1: &quot;KILL!&quot;

Black Mage 2: &quot;KILL!&quot;

Black Mage 3: &quot;KILL!&quot;

Black Mage 1: &quot;KILL!&quot;

[The first mage shoots fire at a guard.]

Burmecian Soldier: &quot;ARGH!&quot;

[Zorn and Thorn walk out onto a ledge over where Zidane and co. are
standing.]

Zorn: &quot;Who is that?&quot;

Thorn: &quot;That, I don't know.&quot;

Zorn: &quot;I know I have seen him somewhere before.&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Somewhere before? I have not seen him. I know.&quot;

Zorn: &quot;I guess it is not important. Let's kill him.&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Yes, kill him, shall we?&quot;

[They sic two mages on the party, but they get defeated.]

Thorn: &quot;HEEE! Savage monsters, they are!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Run away!&quot;

[The party runs into another black mage...]

Black Mage: &quot;KILL!&quot;

[...and they easily defeat it, getting a bell as spoils. Using it
to get into the next room, they find an odd sight. A female moogle
stands next to a broken bell, yelling at something inside of it.]

Moogle: &quot;Darling! Can you hear me!? Darling!!! Please say something!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I didn't expect to see a moogle here. What's wrong?&quot;

Mogmi: &quot;My husband! He's inside the bell! He's trapped! Kupo!!!&quot;

Freya: &quot;You poor thing...&quot;

Mogmi: &quot;We just held our wedding here. Then some scary clowns attacked
       us! I was so scared! Kupopo!!!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That bell's huge. I don't know if we can lift it.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Hmm...&quot;

Mogmi: &quot;No, please!!! Huh?&quot;

[She sniffs around Vivi.]

Mogmi: &quot;&lt;Sniff sniff!&gt; &lt;Sniff sniff!&gt; &lt;Sniff sniff!&gt; &lt;Sniff sniff!&gt;&quot;

Vivi: &quot;H-Hello. Um...&quot;

Mogmi: &quot;Oh! Oh!!! Wait... Yeah! It's you!!! I know you! I know you!!
       I know you!!! Um, um, um, um, um, um, um! Hey, hey, hey!!! You
       have Kupo Nut!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Y-Yeah... I got one in Lindblum.&quot;

Mogmi: &quot;Really!? Really!? Really!? Really!? C-Can I have it?&quot;
       R1 --&gt; Yes
       R2 --&gt; No

       R1: [See below.]
       R2: &quot;Pleaaase!!! Kupooo!!!

[At R1, Vivi gives her the Nut.]

Mogmi: &quot;Kupooo!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Darling! Darling!
       I have yummy Kupo Nut!&quot;

[A moogle lifts the gigantic bell and topples it off of him.]

Moogle: &quot;Kupooo!&quot;

Mogmi: &quot;Darling!!!&quot;

Moogle: &quot;Kupooo! I love Kupo Nuts!&quot;

[He runs off.]

Mogmi: &quot;Darling! Where are you going!? U-Um, thank you! Darling!!!&quot;

[She runs off after her husband.]

Zidane: &quot;What a crazy couple...

[The little bell underneath the large one doesn't open the way to
the exit, so the party uses it to find the other moogles again.]

Moguta: &quot;I love Kupo Nuts! Do you like Kupo Nuts?&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Yes
        R2 --&gt; Not really

        R1: &quot;I like you.&quot;
        R2: &quot;I hate you.&quot; [He repeats his question.]

[After picking R1 (you have to), when you leave, Moguta'll stop you.]

Moguta: &quot;Kupo! Wait! Kupo!&quot;

[He spins a statue nearby, takes something, and spins it back.]

Moguta: &quot;Kupo! Take this, kupo!&quot;

[Zidane gets the Holy Bell.]

Moguta: &quot;Give me Kupo Nuts again, okay, kupo? I'm kupo for Kupo Nuts!&quot;

[Using the Holy Bell, the party enters the last room of the cavern. A
Burmecian Soldier, still alive, is slumped near the water.]

Freya: &quot;Are you alright!?&quot;

Burmecian Soldier: &quot;Freya... Please be careful... Master Gizamaluke
                   has gone mad. He's being controlled by some strange
                   clowns.&quot;

[Just then, a large snake falls into the water and it attacks. They
defeat Master Gizamaluke.]

Freya: &quot;What happened to Master Gizamaluke...? We must hurry! His
       Majesty is in danger!

[The view changes to Steiner at the Grand Citadel South Gate.]

===========================================================
13. Grand Citadel South Gate (SG01)
===========================================================

[Steiner approaches the gate with a bag tied to a stick slung over
his shoulder. This is a different South Gate than the one by Dali,
by the way -- it's, I guess, past the gate to the Bohden Arch near
Chocobo's Forest.]

Steiner: (Once we cross this gate, we are in Alexandrian territory!)

[He walks up to two guards.]

Short Guard: &quot;Hold it right there.&quot;

Tall Guard: &quot;What's the purpose of your visit?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I heard workers were needed to fix South Gate. I brought
         my belongings so that I might live and work here.&quot;

Tall Guard: &quot;That's great! They've been working on the gate non-stop
            since the accident, but it's still broken.&quot;

Short Guard: &quot;I need to check your bag. Rules and regulations, you
             know.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;......&quot;

[Steiner sets his...large bag down.]

Short Guard: &quot;Would you step back?&quot;

Tall Guard: &quot;There, that's good. Sorry, just doing our job. So...
            Where are you from?&quot;

Steiner: (Blast, I must do something!)

Tall Guard: &quot;The police are searching for a girl and a middle-aged
            man. Did you see a pair like that on your way here?&quot;

Short Guard: &quot;This knot is really tight...&quot;

Tall Guard: &quot;The girl supposedly looks exactly like Princess Garnet,
            the most beautiful princess ever to grace Alexandria
            Castle.&quot;

Short Guard: &quot;I got it now.&quot;

Tall Guard: &quot;But you know how Queen Brahne looks. It's hard to believe
            she'd have such a beautiful daughter.&quot;

Short Guard: &quot;Ungh!? WHAT IS THIS!? Wh-What is that!? What are
             those...those... ...rotten things! Are they poison!?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Rotten? I'm not carrying anything that's rotting...&quot;

Tall Guard: &quot;Oh, it's your least favorite food... ...the Lindblum
            delicacy, gysahl pickles. I can't believe how many you
            brought with you!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;They are my favorite! I cannot start my day without them.&quot;

Tall Guard: &quot;Yeah, sure. People who like 'em all say that. You can
            go now.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Thank you. Good day.&quot;

[Steiner walks through the gate. There are a few people around, and
he whispers to the contents of the bag:]

Steiner: (We're inside the gate! Princess, you've done it again. I
         must find a spot where I won't be seen... That alley looks
         acceptable. But a girl and a man are in the way.)

[Steiner talks to the jobless man and the worker around. He talks
to a man inspecting a pile of machinery afterwards:]

Earnest Young Man: &quot;Let's see... I need two of Model #3... Oh, you
                   brought your things with you. Are you here to
                   work?&quot;
                   R1 --&gt; Answer
                   R2 --&gt; Remain silent

                   R1: &quot;I-Indeed.&quot;

                   R2: [Garnet kicks him through the bag.]

                       Steiner: &quot;I-Indeed.&quot;

Earnest Young Man: &quot;Welcome! I'm also new here. I've been working
                   here for five months as the chief engineer of
                   Bohden Gate. But he's the only one working under
                   me. I'll be going back to the castle next month,
                   when my contract expires. I'll be joining a team
                   of engineers who are developing a new engine that
                   runs without Mist. The world outside the Mist
                   Continent is uncharted territory, but there's no
                   need to worry about our safety if we can explore
                   it on an airship. Regent Cid is an advocate of
                   technological advancement. Oh, sorry. I talked
                   your ear off.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;There's something I must tell you.&quot;

Chief Engineer: &quot;...The gate to the bottom of the Mist has been
                left broken!? Did he think he could get away with
                that!? Excuse me!&quot;

[The man runs off after learning of his worker's incompetance.]

Steiner: (Now I just need to get rid of that girl...)

[If you talked to the girl first, he'll say:]

Steiner: (That just leaves the young man over there...)

[Steiner runs over to the girl.]

Part-time Worker Mary: &quot;I can't believe he went out of business... I
                       didn't know, because I was on the other side of
                       the moutain.&quot;
                       R1 --&gt; Console her
                       R2 --&gt; Don't console her

                       R1 (Steiner): &quot;What good is it to bemoan what
                                     has already happened?&quot;

                           [Garnet kicks him]

                           Steiner: &quot;Wh-What I meant to say was that...
                                    Now that we are here, there must be
                                    things we can do to help the ones
                                    we love.&quot;

                           Part-time Worker Mary: &quot;You're right. I
                                                  gotta encourage him.
                                                  Thanks!)

                       R2: [Garnet kicks him; dialogue cancelled.]

[After Mary goes to talk to Jeff:]

Steiner: (The coast is clear.)

[Steiner heads into the alley, but--]

Short Guard: &quot;Hey, hold on! Rules and regulations, you know. Would
             you come over here? Stop right there! Don't make a move
             until I tell you! Now, turn toward me slowly... Don't
             make a false move. Phew... You need a Gate Pass to reach
             the South Gate summit. I'm leaving it right there. Pick
             it up after I leave. I'd come closer, but you're carrying
             those stinky pickles! See? I'm leaving it right here!&quot;

[Steiner picks up the pass after the guard leaves and hits the alley.]

Steiner: &quot;Ahem... 'Tis foolishness! If all were so easy, why, none
         would suffer in this world'&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Steiner...? Is it okay for me to come out?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Yes!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Thank you. I will come out now. Please keep an eye out.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Yes!&quot;

Dagger: &lt;Rustle rustle...&gt; &lt;Rustle rustle...&gt; &quot;Oh, finally! Some
        fresh air! What a horrible smell... It gave me a terrible
        headache.&quot; (Maybe I'll get changed while he's on lookout.)

Steiner: &quot;Let's see...&quot;
         R1 --&gt; Continue looking
         R2 --&gt; Go over to the other side

         R1: &quot;Uh-huh...
         R2: [Steiner runs to the other side, past Dagger.]

             Dagger: (Ahh!) &quot;(Don't look this way...)&quot;

[Dagger comes out from behind the crate.]

Dagger: &quot;You can turn around now, Steiner.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess...!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Steiner!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Yes...? Oh, um, yes, Miss Dagger.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;You have to call me Dagger until we reach Treno. Don't
        salute me, either.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Yes, until we reach Treno and find a way back to the castle,
         I will be careful.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Okay, let's go.&quot;

[They head to the cable car screen.]

Dagger: &quot;Wow...! That cable car will take us to the summit. We're
        almost there, Steiner. Alexandria is just beyond the summit,
        right? I managed it without Zidane's help...!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;You never needed him to begin with, Princess.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

[They board the Berkmea cable car and sit down.]

Dagger: &quot;Let's sit here.&quot;

Conductor: &quot;Please wait while I prepare for departure.&quot;

Part-time Worker Mary: &quot;Wait! Wait for me! &lt;Pant, pant...&gt; I made it!
                       Thank you for your kind words earlier.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;No, I thank you.&quot;

Part-time Worker Mary: &quot;?&quot;

Conductor: &quot;Now departing!

[The cable car takes off.]

Garnet: &quot;Phew... I feel more relaxed now.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;That is understandable. Our journey from Lindblum was very
         tough. But... ...it was your white magic that helped me
         through the battles against all those monsters... ...your
         fortitude that got us past the obnoxious moogles in Chocobo's
         Forest... ...and, finally, your idea to use gysahl pickles to
         get past the South Gate guards! I am thoroughly impressed by
         your intelligence and courage, Princess!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Steiner, you can't call me that.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;My apologies. I'm just not used to...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;It's okay. I made lots of mistakes when Zidane taught me how
        to talk like this.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;That peasant had no manners whatsoever! Although...he did
         have some wit for a bumpkin, but... The way he spoke to you
         was simply unacceptable! I say good riddance.&quot;

[The view changes back to the party in Gizamaluke's Grotto, talking
with the wounded soldier nearby.]

Freya: &quot;Can you stand up?&quot;

Burmecian Soldier: &quot;Don't worry... about me... Please... protect
                   Bur...me...&quot;

Freya: &quot;I will protect Burmecia. You have my word.&quot;

[They all run out of the exit.]

===========================================================
14. North Gate (NG02)
===========================================================

[On the right cliff wall from the exit is another arch the party
can visit.]

Freya: &quot;The smell of fire... And blood! There must have been a huge
       battle on the other side of that gate...&quot;

Quina: &quot;Something smell bad. I get bad feeling! Flower smell good!
       You smell flower!&quot;

Freya: &quot;Quina does whatever s/he feels like doing. I must learn from
       his ways.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I don't think it's intentional, Freya.&quot;

Freya: &quot;No, if I had done as I pleased, I would've been...&quot;

Quina: &quot;Zidane, this flower taste good!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;See what I mean?&quot;

Freya: &quot;But still... Let's go! Burmecia is just ahead!&quot;

===========================================================
15. Burmecia, Realm of Eternal Rain (BR01)
===========================================================

[The party runs to the gate of the dreary, rain-splattered city,
finding it broken and battered.]

Zidane: &quot;So...this is Freya's home... What are you doing? Get over
        here.&quot;

Freya: &quot;It's been five years... I've been away for so long. Not a
       night went by when I didn't dream about home. I can't believe
       I'm here... I am no longer the selfish child I was five years
       ago. The time has come for me to serve my kingdom as a
       Burmecian dragon knight once again!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I'll do what I can to help!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Me, too!&quot;
Quina: &quot;I help, too!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Let's go.&quot;

[They all run off, but Freya lingers.]

Freya: &quot;What can I do for my kingdom? This is not the time.&quot;

[She runs off to meet the others. Soon, they come to a residential
screen, and Zorn and Thorn appear on two balconies, looking down at
them.]

Zorn: &quot;It is them again!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Most persistant, they are!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Black mages!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;Black mages!&quot;

[Two Black Mages appear.]

Black Mage: &quot;KILL!&quot;
Black Mage: &quot;KILL!&quot;

[Zidane and company trounce them, however.]

Zorn: &quot;The general will punish you for this!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Yes! Very scary, it is, when the general gets mad!&quot;

[Zidane runs upstairs in an effort to find the two, but fails. He
finds a soldier, though, who directs him to a bell hidden under a
bed. They use it to progress towards the castle.]

Freya: &quot;Zidane... Burmecia's royal palace is beyond these steps. It
       must be in ruins, just like everything else. I can't bear to
       see it like that...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I understand, but we can't go back now. We have to find out
        who's behind this.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...I wanna find out who those guys were...and why I look like
      them.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Look, Vivi's scared, too. But we have to face reality.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Come on, Freya. It'll be okay...&quot;

Freya: &quot;Vivi... Do you really know what you're doing? The answer you
       seek may forever change your life for the worse.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Um...... Y-Yeah... But... But I have to... I have to find out
      who I am... I'm scared... What if I'm not even human...?&quot;

Freya: &quot;Vivi...&quot;

Quina: &quot;What you talking about? I not human, but you definitely human!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Someone's coming!&quot;

[A soldier with woman and child run down the stairs, stopping.]

Burmecian Soldier Dan: &quot;Who are you!? Are you in league with the
                       black mages!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;No!&quot;

Burmecian Soldier Dan: &quot;You're lying! There's a black mage right
                       behind you!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;No! I didn't do anything! I would never hurt anyone!&quot;

Burmecian Soldier Dan: &quot;Lies!&quot;

Freya: &quot;He's telling the truth!&quot;

Burmecian Soldier Dan: &quot;...Freya!?&quot;

Freya: &quot;It's good to see you, Dan.&quot;

Burmecian Soldier Dan: &quot;Damn, I haven't seen you in years. Where've
                       you been!? Actually, this isn't the best time
                       to talk! We've gotta get out of here fast.
                       There are black mages swarming all over the
                       place. What are you waiting for!?&quot;

Freya: &quot;Where is the king?&quot;

Burmecian Soldier Dan: &quot;I don't know. I didn't see him in the palace.
                       Well, I'm going. I have my own family to worry
                       about. Freya, forget about the king and get out
                       of here! We're no match for those black mages!&quot;

[Dan runs off.]

Freya: &quot;I will protect my home and my king at any cost. Let's go to
       the palace.

[The party walks up to the steps of the ransacked and broken palace.]

Zidane: &quot;Geez, this is terrible... Freya, I'm sorry, but from the
        looks of this, I don't think the king made it. ......&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Talk to her
        R2 --&gt; Leave her alone
        R3 --&gt; I wonder if Dagger's alright

        R1: &quot;I don't know what to tell you... We can only hope that
            the king and the others escaped.&quot;

            Freya: &quot;......&quot;

        R2: [See below.]

        R3: &quot;I don't think Dagger came here... I wonder where she
            went...&quot;

[After picking R2:]

Zidane: &quot;Vivi, let's go see what's over there.&quot;

Freya: &quot;!!!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Freya!&quot;

[Freya jumps up high and lands on a statue above.]

Freya: &quot;There's someone inside the palace! What are you waiting for?
       Get up here.&quot;

[She runs inside.]

Zidane: &quot;You make it sound so easy... I guess I'll start here. Come
        on.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Um...okay.&quot;

[Vivi jumps up and faceplants, like usual.]

Zidane: &quot;Oh, man. I'm gonna go on ahead. Try to find a way up here.
        I'll meet you up top.&quot;

Quina: &quot;I meet you after I eat food inside palace!&quot;

[Zidane jumps up and runs in after Frey. He finds her hiding behind a
statue, watching some people down below in the palace.]

Zidane: &quot;Who is that?&quot;

Freya: &quot;I knew she was behind all this.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What do you mean, you knew?&quot;

Freya: &quot;I decided to return to Burmecia because I heard rumors that
       Brahne had set her sights on our kingdom.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Then that girl standing next to her must be Beatrix,
        Alexandria's general.&quot;

Freya: &quot;That's Beatrix? The cold-blooded knight who shows no mercy.
       Beatrix...

[Freya has a flashback with a man.]

Freya: &quot;Beatrix?&quot;

Man: &quot;Yes... Beatrix. I hear there are many fierce warriors out in
     the world--some even more powerful than even I... ...Beatrix of
     Alexandria, in particular. They say her swordsmanship is the best
     in the land.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Sir Fratley, do you still insist on going on your journey?&quot;

Sir Fratley: &quot;Yes... Please understand, Freya. Right now, Burmecia is
             at peace, while other nations are slowly but surely
             gaining power. I don't know if my spear alone is enough
             to protect Burmecia... ...which is precisely why I must
             go out into the world.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Sir Fratley...I don't think I can live on my own--not without
       you.&quot;

Sir Fratley: &quot;Freya, you're going to be fine. Trust your strength...
             and have faith in your destiny. Once I complete my journey
             around the world, I will return to Burmecia.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Then promise me, one more time, that you will return.&quot;

Sir Fratley: &quot;I promise.&quot;

[Fratley walks away, and the screen blacks out.]

Freya: &quot;Fratley... You never came back... You've left me with nothing
       except rumors of your death. I couldn't believe it! I still
       won't believe it! Never. Not until I witness proof of your
       death with my own eyes. And I will travel forever across the
       world forever if I must...&quot;

[The flashback ends and Zidane looks over.]

Zidane: &quot;Are you alright?&quot;

Freya: &quot;Yes. I was just thinking...about the past...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...You still can't get over him, huh? Who is that?&quot;

[Just then, someone in white walks towards Beatrix and Brahne.
Freya and Zidane listen in.]

Mystery Man: &quot;I find this rain quite pleasant... I feel as though
             the raindrops are blessing our victory...&quot;

Brahne: &quot;This is a great victory for us. Kuja, your black mages made
        this conquest so simple. My only concern now is finding the
        king of Burmecia. We must take care of him once and for all,
        and prevent these rats from ever rising up again. Beatrix,
        what's taking so long!?&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;I don't know, Your Majesty. I've ordered Zorn and Thorn
         to search the preimeter, but there's been no word so far. I
         will join them and lead the search right away.&quot;

Kuja: &quot;You're wasting your time.&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;What?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Rats often look for new homes when they sense an earthquake.
      They probably moved to the sandy tree house by now... So, you
      see, it's too late. The king has already turned tail and fled.&quot;

Brahne: &quot;Sandy tree house... Surely, you can't mean Cleyra!? It'll be
        quite difficult if they escaped to Cleyra.&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Cleyra... Unless we can get through that sandstorm, it will
         be impossible to attack them.&quot;

Brahne: &quot;Sneaky, little rats! Kuja, what do you think? Surely, with
        your powers, there must be something you can do.&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Of course, Your Majesty. I will present you a marvelous display
      of my power. I am certain that you will be most pleased. I was
      wondering if you would gather your troops near Cleyra. I'm
      certain those filthy rats will retaliate in full force, and my
      black mages may not be enough.&quot;

[Up at the statue:]

Zidane: &quot;Sounds like we got trouble.&quot;

Freya: &quot;That sinister man... Who is he?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Beats me... I've never seen him before. Well, it sounds like
        they're going to Cleyra. I've always wondered why people call
        it the 'City of Illusion.'&quot;

Freya: &quot;I don't know, either. Cleyra has remained in isolation for
       hundreds of years. If my poeple escaped to there, they'll be
       safe, at least for a while.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What's the place like?&quot;

Freya: &quot;The people of Cleyra are originally from Burmecia. Long ago,
       they severed ties with Burmecia over a trivial conflict. Now
       the kingdom is at peace, shielded by a large sandstorm.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Look, there's someone else coming!&quot;

[A Burmecian soldier runs over to Beatrix.]

Freya: &quot;What is he thinking!?&quot;
Zidane: &quot;Geez, he's gonna get killed!&quot;

[Zidane and Freya jump down and run towards him.]

Burmecian Soldier: &quot;Burmecia will never fall! Prepare to die!!!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;You wish to fight me, Beatrix of Alexandria?&quot;

Burmecian Soldier: &quot;B-Beatrix!?&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;I commend your courage, but I will show you no mercy.&quot;

[Zidane and Freya arrive.]

Zidane: &quot;Hold it!&quot;

Freya: &quot;You'll have to deal with us, first! We'll take care of this.
       Go find the king. Protect him with your life.&quot;

Burmecian Soldier: &quot;...Thank you, Freya.&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Ha ha ha. I've never been so humiliated in my life. I once
         killed a hundred knights single-handedly... To me, you two
         are nothing more than insects.&quot;

[Vivi and Quina run over, and the battle begins, but Beatrix stands
strong until the end.]

Beatrix: &quot;You're no match for me!&quot;

[She uses Stock Break on the party, reducing them all to critical
health (1 HP). The battle then ends.]

Beatrix: &quot;Ignorant fools.&quot;

[The party members lie on the ground, huffin' and puffin'.]

Beatrix: &quot;How ridiculously weak... Isn't there anyone who is worthy
         of facing me?&quot;

Brahne: &quot;Come, Beatrix. We must prepare to attack Cleyra.&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Yes, Your Majesty.&quot;

[The two leave.]

Kuja: &quot;Now what do we have here...? Another filthy rat, and... Hmm...
      This boy could become a problem...&quot;

[FMV. Kuja looks over the wounded members of the party before riding
away on a silver dragon. The finish of the sequence concludes the
first disc.]

16. Grand Citadel South Gate (SG02)
===========================================================

[The disc opens on the two gate guards Steiner encountered before.]

Tall Guard: &quot;There's been a lot of trouble lately.&quot;

Short Guard: &quot;Oh, you mean about Burmecia? I heard they were attacked
             by an army of soldiers wearing pointy hats. I wanna go
             fight on the frontline. Instead, I'm rotting away in this
             stinkin' place.&quot;

Tall Guard: &quot;Really? I don't like wars. Why would someone start a
            war...? That guy who passed through here with the huge
            bag... Did he look suspicious to you?&quot;

Short Guard: &quot;No... I don't think so.&quot;

Tall Guard: &quot;But weren't you the one who thought he was suspicious?&quot;

Short Guard: &quot;You know me! I'm always like that. I'm telling you,
             people who eat pickles are nice people. I envy him.
             Gysahl pickles are the only picles I can't eat.&quot;

Tall Guard: &quot;You're really confusing, you know that?&quot;

Short Guard: &quot;I know... Why do you think I ended up here?&quot;

[On the cable car, Steiner walks back to where Dagger is sitting.]

Steiner: &quot;The conductor said we'll be arriving at the Summit Station
         soon. Prin... Ahem... Miss Dagger? She's sleeping... (The
         princess believes what she heard about Queen Brahne. Queen
         Brahne would never start a war... It's all a misunderstanding.
         She will see that when she talks to the queen. ...I need not
         concern myself with such matters. My only mission is to
         protect the princess.)

Conductor: &quot;Summit Station! Summit Station!&quot;

[Everyone walks off.]

Dagger: &quot;Thank you very much.&quot;

Conductor: &quot;Take care. You'll have to wait awhile until the car to
           Alexandria arrives.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;How long will it be?&quot;

Conductor: &quot;It arrives when this car reaches Bohden Station, so...
           ...about as long as you spent in the car. Why don't you
           wait in the rest area up ahead?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Okay. What's wrong, Steiner?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;P-Princess...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Hey, what did I say about--&quot;

Steiner: &quot;It's Alexandria! We're finally home!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Really...?&quot;

[They go to see the view on the other side of the station.]

Dagger: &quot;We're home...! But I still can't see the castle.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess, Alexandria may only mean the castle to you,
         but...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Hey, are you making fun of me for being naive?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;N-No, I'm not...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;It's okay. Let's go.&quot;

[They enter the rest stop area.]

Dagger: &quot;This must be the rest area.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Let us gather information while we wait for the car to
         Alexandria!&quot;

[Dagger talks around and hears a familiar voice down at the station.
She goes down there and finds Cinna and Marcus talking.]

Dagger: &quot;That's...&quot;

Cinna: &quot;I missed my ride! What am I gonna do now!?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;How the heck should I know...? You were the one who wanted
        to watch the scenery while eating South Gate Bundt Cake.&quot;

Cinna: &quot;I'm gonna be late returning to Lindblum...&quot;

Marcus: &quot;There's nothing we can do. I won't tell the boss.&quot;

Cinna: &quot;Thanks, buddy! Let's eat another bundt cake!

Marcus: &quot;Geez...&quot;

[Marcus and Cinna walk inside; Dagger follows 'em in. Steiner finds
them both first, though.]

Steiner: &quot;Scoundrels!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;???&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Are you here to kidnap the princess again!?&quot;

Cinna: &quot;Who's the big tin man?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;WHAT!? How dare you!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;He's the captain of the Knights of Pluto.&quot;

Cinna: &quot;Oh yeah! You're one bad actor.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Grrr...! Have you no respect?&quot;

[Dagger goes over to Steiner.]

Steiner: &quot;Princess...!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Steiner! That's enough!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Wh-Wha...!?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Can't I even talk to my friends?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Freinds!? But they're...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Adelbert Steiner!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Yes, Prin--ma'am!&quot;

Cinna: &quot;He's bein' scolded.&quot;

Marcus: &quot;How embarrassing.&quot;

[They hear a sound outside.]

Attendant: &quot;The cable car to Alexandria has arrived!&quot;

Cinna: &quot;It's here!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;But you're goin' to Lindblum.&quot;

Cinna: &quot;I-I know that! But you're going to Alexandria!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Yeah, I'm heading to Treno.&quot;

Cinna: &quot;I'll see you off.&quot;

[They walk to the station.]

Dagger: &quot;Marcus is going to Treno, too? Let's go, Steiner. Steiner?
        Are you mad at me?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;No, ma'am! I'm coming along.&quot;

[They go to the station, where Cinna's seeing Marcus off.]

Cinna: &quot;Good luck!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Yeah. I'll save our bro!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;...Bro?&quot;

[Dagger and Steiner climb onto the car.]

Conductor: &quot;Now departing.&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Why are you going to Treno, Marcus?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;To save our brother.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Who?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;There's only man I call 'Bro.' That's Blank. We've been
        gathering info to cure his petrification. We finally learned
        about an item called Supersoft that cures all forms of
        petrification.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What about Cinna?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Cinna's going back to the Tantalus hideout in Lindblum to
        tell the others.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I see...&quot;

Marcus: &quot;It's my turn for questions.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yes?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Where's Zidane?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;We separated in Lindblum.&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Got rid of him as soon as he got you to Lindblum, huh?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;How could you say that!? It's only because Zidane kept
        treating me like a child! ...I don't care about him.&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Fine. Then I don't know anything.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

[Dagger talks to him again.]

Dagger: &quot;Say, Marcus... Um, is there any way I can help?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Help with what?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Well... I was partially responsible for what happened, so...&quot;

Marcus: &quot;No, thanks. We'll be fine on our own.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;But wouldn't it be better if--&quot;

[The cable car shakes.]

Steiner: &quot;Wh-What was that!?&quot;

Conductor: &quot;It might be engine trouble! Please remain in your seats
           while I check. Ahhhhhh! It's a demon! A demon in a pointy
           hat!!!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;A pointy hat!?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;What's wrong!?&quot;

[They all pile out and see none other than Black Waltz No. 3.]

Marcus: &quot;What's going on!? !!!&quot;

Black Waltz No. 3: &quot;Mission...retrieve...princess...alive...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Isn't that the one we saw on the cargo ship?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Monster! I'll finish you off this time!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Wait, Steiner! Tell me something! Why do you want to capture me?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess, it's too dangerous! Please stand back!&quot;

Black Waltz No. 3: &quot;Mission...retrieve...princess...alive...&quot;

Marcus: &quot;It's no use! It doesn't understand!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;But--&quot;

Black Waltz No. 3: &quot;Eliminate...all!&quot;

[The party kills the Black Waltz once and for all.]

Dagger: &quot;Why...? Why...? What did he want with me?&quot;&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess...&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Burmecia was attacked by an army of black mage soldiers...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;...I know.&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Those mages wiped out the people of Burmecia...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Who would do such a thing?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Are you serious!? How ignorant can you be!?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;What do you mean!?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Stop it, Steiner... I know who did it.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;We're almost in Alexandria... I must go to the castle and
        see my mother... She'll listen to me.&quot;

[Back on the moving cable car, Dagger sits down next to Marcus.]

Dagger: &quot;I think we're almost there.&quot;

Marcus: &quot;So, you already heard about the attack on Burmecia.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Of course. I'm not like Steiner.&quot;

Marcus: &quot;You've changed.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Me? You mean the way I talk?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Not just that.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Well... A lot has happened. Oh, speaking of which...!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Yeah?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I've been through tons of battles. I'm a seasoned pro, now!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;You need to find Supersoft and save Blank, right?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;You're gonna come along, even if I refuse, right?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Of course I am! This is so exciting! I've always wanted to
        see the marvelous architecture of Treno. I can hardly wait!&quot;

Marcus: (On second thought, maybe she hasn't changed that much.)

[The Berkmea car cruises to a stop in Alexandria territory and the
four passengers pile out.]

Conductor: &quot;Take care! The road splits up ahead. Go right to reach
           Treno, and left to reach Dali.&quot;

[The party hangs a right and goes through the gate. On the world map,
they soon arrive at the city of Treno, under an eternal veil of night.]

===========================================================
17. Dark City Treno (TR01)
===========================================================

[The party walks in through the front gate.]

Steiner: &quot;Princess, this is Treno, the City of Nobles.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;We need to find out which noble has the Supersoft.&quot;

Marcus: &quot;There aren't many nobles living here. The nights are long.
        It's a great place for thieves.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;People like you turned this city into a slum!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;...Let's steal the Supersoft and get this over with.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Steal!? How dare you! Do you think I'd let you commit a
         crime before my very eyes!?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;How else would we get the Supersoft?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Quiet! I will not allow such disgraceful behavior!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;I never asked you to come along. Quit complaining.&quot;

[Dagger walks off.]

Steiner: &quot;Don't you talk back to me! First of all--&quot;

Marcus: &quot;...Uh-oh.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Do not interrupt me while I'm talking!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Look behind you.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;What!? Princess, I urge you not to...!!! P-Princess!?
         No... Not again... Never have I dealt with such hardship in
         my 18 years of service. This is all because of you and your
         scoundrel friends...!&quot;

[...but Marcus has already left, too.]

Steiner: &quot;Gone... An Alexandrian knight must not let such a frivolous
         matter get to him! I must find the princess!&quot;

[Steiner goes to the auction house.]

Steiner: &quot;Princess! Thank goodness I found you. I was worried.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;How can I find the Supersoft if I have to keep listening to
        your complaints?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Such harsh words...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I don't think it's here, anyway. Where's Marcus?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I do not know...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Maybe Marcus found it already. Are you coming? I'm going,
        with or without you.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I-I shall follow you, Princess.&quot;

[Steiner runs out; Garnet gazes back up at the empty balcony.]

Dagger: &quot;...I've seen him before...&quot;

[Dagger and Steiner find Marcus in the downstairs of the bar.]

Marcus: &quot;We're ready to retrieve the Supersoft.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Good! At last, we can save Blank! When do we leave?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;We can leave right away. So you're coming along, huh? Are
        you ready?&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Ready
        R2 --&gt; Not yet

        R1: [See below.]
        R2 (Dagger): &quot;I still need time to get ready. Is that alright?&quot;

           Marcus: &quot;Sure... But make it quick.&quot;

[After picking R1:]

Dagger: &quot;Let's go.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess! Princess! Please wait!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Boss's waiting at the dock.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Boss? You mean...&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Yup, there's only one man we call 'Boss.'&quot;

[They start walking to the dock.]

Steiner: &quot;Princess! Please wait! It may be a trap! You cannot trust
         criminals! Think of the consequences! You are a princess!
         If the queen hears about this... Princess!&quot;

Baku: &quot;Princess, do you know that breakin' and enterin' is a crime?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I need to make sure you don't steal anything else.&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Let's go.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Dammit! I am coming along. It is my duty to protect the
         princess from bad influences!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Do whatever you want...&quot;

Baku: &quot;Always talkin' about yer duty. Ain't you got any thoughts of
      yer own?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Don't you talk back to me! I am escorting the princess--&quot;

Baku: &quot;I thought you might've changed after travelin with Zidane,
      but... ...you ain't changed. Do you even know why you're here?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Wh-What do you mean!?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Let's just go, okay?&quot;

[The view changes to the auction house, where Kuja and the auctioneer
are standing in an empty parlor.]

Auctioneer: &quot;How was Burmecia?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Not bad... Better if I didn't have to see those vermin and
      the ugly elephant-lady. They offend my senses.&quot;

Auctioneer: &quot;You must be tired.&quot;

Kuja: &quot;It's not over yet. The rest of the vermind must be done away
      with.&quot;

Auctioneer: &quot;Will you be heading to Cleyra, then?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Yes; I trust you will deliver them?&quot;

Auctioneer: &quot;Certainly. I shall prepare now...&quot;

Kuja: &quot;By the way, did you see a pretty lady in the crowd today?&quot;

Auctioneer: &quot;A pretty lady? Shall I arrange a meeting?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;There's no need. The canary I've been after... She flew into
      my cage of her own free will.&quot;

Auctioneer: &quot;?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Never would I have imagined running into you in a place like
      this. It must be fate. But you cannot rest your wings yet...
      Fly home to your mother, little canary. I, too, will welcome
      you home with open arms.&quot;

[Back at the dock, the ship's already rolling through the water under
the many arches of Treno's underbelly. Dagger and Steiner reflect,
but I'll add in the parentheses myself (just so one knows).]

Steiner: (What in the world am I doing...? I'm assisting thieves in
         committing a crime... No... I must be patient. Protect the
         princess. Escort her back to the castle. Focus on your
         duties... Trust the queen. She would never commit an atrocity.
         There must be a good reason. No thoughts of my own? Nonsense.
         How can I, a lowly knight, undrestand the queen's thinking? I
         need not worry about the ramblings of a criminal. Just think
         about escorting the princess home. I'll probably never see him
         again... He was the culprit... He pulled the princess and me
         into his intrigues.)

[On the other side of the ship, Dagger's also gazing out at the water.]

Dagger: (It was your fault, Zidane. If you hadn't treated me like a
        child... ...I wouldn't be here hunting after Supersoft to save
        one of your friends. Why am I doing this...? Because Blank
        saved me? Yes, he saved me. He saved my life... The least I can
        do is return the favor... But I never thought about things like
        this before...)

[The party arrives at a building and looks around the empty place. It
is the synth shop, actually.]

Steiner: &quot;How are we to find Supersoft in this mountain of boxes?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Just find it.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;?&quot;

Marcus: (Someone's coming!)

[A short man in glasses walks down the stairs nearby.]

Scholarly Man: &quot;Oh, I can't believe I ran out of ink on a night like
               this. I must find more ink and go back to the observatory...&quot;

Marcus: (Should I take care of him?)

Dagger: (......! Wait!)

Steiner: (Princess! No!)

[Dagger runs out into the open.]

Scholarly Man: &quot;Hmm?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Scholarly Man: &quot;Y-You're...!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I've missed you, Doctor Tot.&quot;

Tot: &quot;P-Princess! Princess Garnet!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Doctor Tot?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;You know him?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Doctor Tot is the highly respected scholar who tutored the
         princess.&quot;

Tot: &quot;Ah, Master Steiner. You must be quiet or you'll wake the shopkeeper.
     But, Princess, what on earth are you doing here?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;It's a long story. We're looking for Supersoft right now.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;There is a proper reason for this! We are not here to steal,
         or commit any form of crime--&quot;

Voice: &quot;Somebody down there?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;!&quot;
Marcus: &quot;!&quot;
Steiner: &quot;!&quot;

Tot: &quot;Run along! I will give you Supersoft later. Go left from the
     Treno entrance, and continue until you find a large tower. The
     tower is my home, but I shall unlock it and await your arrival.&quot;
</pre><pre id="faqspan-5">
Dagger: &quot;Alright. Let's go back! Thank you, Doctor Tot. I'll see you later!&quot;

[The three run off just as the Shopkeeper comes down.]

Shopkeeper: &quot;Oh, it's you, Doctor Tot.&quot;

Tot: &quot;Ah, great timing. I ran out of ink.&quot;

Shopkeeper: &quot;You should've called me. I'll get yelled at if the
            inventory's wrong!&quot;

[The shopkeeper walks back upstairs.]

Tot: &quot;Princess...&quot;

[Back at the bar, Baku and the others are walking upstairs, too.]

Baku: &quot;So, this Tootsie's gonna give us Supersoft?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;It's Tot.&quot;

Baku: &quot;ACHOO!!! Whatever. I can't believe Tantalus is at the mercy
      of some old man. Hmph. I guess we gotta keep babysittin' the
      princess.&quot;

[Steiner and Dagger walk up the stairs, too.]

Marcus: &quot;Still?&quot;

Baku: &quot;He ain't gonna give you the Supersoft unless you're with the
      princess. That's the deal, Princess. I'm askin' you to take
      Marcus to this Toot.&quot;

Marcus: &quot;...It's Tot.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I was going to, anyway.&quot;

Baku: &quot;Well, go get some rest before you go. I'm sure Ted needs time
      to prepare.&quot;

Marcus: &quot;...It's Tot.&quot;

[Later on, the party goes to the tower, and Dagger stops.]

Dagger: &quot;Oh...&quot;

[She sees Tot looking at the moon before disappearing up.]

Dagger: &quot;Doctor Tot...&quot;

[Dagger goes up.]

Tot: &quot;Princess! Thank you for coming. Welcome to my humble abode.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;This is your home?&quot;

Tot: &quot;I traveled quite far in search of a sponsor for my research
     after I departed Alexandria. I finally found one here in Treno.
     You have grown into a fine young woman. I am pleased to see you
     again.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Doctor Tot! You look quite well.&quot;

Tot: &quot;Ah, Master Steiner! Are you escorting the princess?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Yes, sir! I deeply regret my earlier actions.&quot;

Tot: &quot;Still a straight arrow, aren't you? I'm sure you had your
     reasons, but I won't ask why. The Supersoft is in the box right
     there. Please take it.&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Don't mind if I do!&quot;

[Marcus gets the Supersoft.]

Steiner: &quot;Have you no manners? Thank the good doctor!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;It's quite alright, Master Steiner...&quot;

[Garnet looks up at the large globe in his room.]

Dagger: &quot;Master Tot, is this Gaia?&quot;

Tot: &quot;Yes, it's a globe of our planet, Gaia.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I remember your lessons.&quot;

Tot: &quot;You remember the ramblings of an old fool...&quot;

[A flashback of Tot in the Alexandrian library takes place.]

Tot: &quot;Two phrases are commonly found in documents more than 500 years
     old... One is 'jewel.' The other is 'summoner tribe.' But 500
     years ago, the phrases mysteriously vanished from history... The
     archaeologist Frederick Ash theorized that 'jewel' refers to the
     pendant passed down to the ruler of Alexandria. But the pendant...
     It is much too small to be referring to the same 'jewel.' Other
     research suggests a relationship betwen 'eidolons' and 'magic
     stones'...&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Doctor Tot!&quot;

[Dagger as a little girl runs down the stairs.]

Tot: &quot;Ah, Princess!&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Were you reading big books again?&quot;

Tot: &quot;Ha ha ha... I've already read every book in this library. But
     I think better when I'm surrounded by old books.&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Really? I don't like books.&quot;

Tot: &quot;You are a person of dignity. It is imperative that you study hard.&quot;

Garnet: &quot;I know, I know... Oh, but I was quite taken by that book you
        gave me. What was it called? It was...&quot;

Tot: &quot;Was it 'I Want to Be Your Canary,' by Lord Avon?&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Oh yes, that's the one! So there is a book I like after all.&quot;

Tot: &quot;My, my...&quot;

Garnet: &quot;What's this, Doctor Tot?&quot;

Tot: &quot;That is a globe of Gaia. It's a model of our planet.&quot;

Garnet: &quot;A Gaia globe? I never knew our castle was shaped like a
        sphere.&quot;

Tot: &quot;Ha ha ha... We live on the surface, Princess.&quot;

Garnet: &quot;?&quot;

[Tot starts talking to himself again.]

Tot: &quot;Ah, yes, the stars! They inspired the theories relating stones
     and eidolons. That is why... Oh! I'm sorry, I was lost in thought
     again.&quot;

Garnet: &quot;It's okay. Where is my room on this globe?&quot;

Tot: &quot;Oh, your room is much too small to point out on this globe...&quot;

Garnet: &quot;What about the castle?&quot;

Tot: &quot;That, I can do...&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Oh, and Uncle Cid's castle?&quot;

[The flashback ends and Garnet and Tot have moved up inside the giant
globe in Tot's room via a ladder.]

Dagger: &quot;How long has it been? Eight years?&quot;

Tot: &quot;Time passes quickly. But I haven't changed. I continue to
     collect and research these items.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Where did you find this globe?&quot;

Tot: &quot;It's an antique. It's broken, as you can see, but I use it as
     an observation deck. Ironic, isn't it? Looking up at the stars
     from inside a globe.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;It sure is...&quot;

Tot: &quot;I don't mean to meddle in your affairs, but... I am on your
     side, now and forever. Please tell me if there is anything I can
     do.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Doctor Tot...&quot;

[Dagger tells him the story of their happenings, and Tot paces the
room in pensive thought.]

Tot: &quot;I see... So the queen's forces have already grown quite
     powerful... Okay, then. It may be dangerous, but I shall see to
     it that you reach Alexandria.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;How?&quot;

Tot: &quot;I had an old transportation device remodeled in the case of
     such an emergency. This way, please.&quot;

[He opens a hatch in the floor.]

Steiner: &quot;Ah! We can finally return to Alexandria!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;I'm coming with you.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;What!? Why!?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;I can reach Blank more easily from Alexandria.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yes, come with us, Marcus. Okay, Steiner?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Grrr...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Let's go save Blank! And restore my mother to her former self!&quot;

[Dagger, Tot, and the others climb down the hatch.]

===========================================================
18. Gargan Roo (GR01)
===========================================================

[They all climb down inside.]

Tot: &quot;This is Gargan Roo, an ancient travel route between Treno and
     Alexandria.&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Why was this thing built under a tower?&quot;

Tot: &quot;Actually, Gargan Roo was in use long before the invention of
     airships! The tower was on top of a disused tunnel.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;But it looks fairly new.&quot;

Tot: &quot;I convinced Mr. Bishop to keep this place intact. I haven't
     used it since it was remodeled, mind you. We must first activate
     the tunnel-connection sequence and call the gargant inside.
     Let's see... Where was the sequence trigger?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;So all we have to do is find the sequence trigger. Princess,
         let us find it!&quot;

[In the adjacent room, there's a lever.]

Narrative: Pull the lever? {Yes/No}

[Dagger pulls it and runs back into the next room, heading into the
other adjacent room. There's a long handle near the passage side.]

Tot: &quot;Ah, this is it! This is where we call the gargant inside.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

Tot: &quot;Gargant Roo Treno station is shaped like a circle. When you
     pull on that lever, gargant circles around the station
     continuously.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I don't understand what you're saying...&quot;

Tot: &quot;Better to show than tell. Princess, will you pull on that lever
     over there?

[Dagger pulls the lever and something comes down the tunnel.]

Dagger: &quot;Wh-What is it!?&quot;

[A giant spider-like thing with a carriage crawls on a rail above.]

Dagger: &quot;What's that!?&quot;

Tot: &quot;Ah, perfect timing! That is the gargant, a giant insect that
     pulls this trolley! Next, we must hail the gargant.&quot;

[Dagger runs into the next screen and goes to an object on the wall.]

Tot: &quot;Yes, that's the one! The gargant should stop when you pull on
     the lever.&quot;

[Dagger pulls it, and a food tray stops the gargant.]

Tot: &quot;Please hurry. It'll resume once it's finished eating.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Are you sure it won't keep going around in circles?&quot;

Tot: &quot;It won't. I will reverse the connection sequence and let the
     gargant out of the station. Please look after the princess,
     Master Steiner.&quot;

[Marcus and Dagger get on.]

Steiner: &quot;Of course!&quot;

Tot: &quot;The princess is bright, but she is still young and naive. I am
     concerned about her safety. Please make your own decision on the
     matter at hand and protect her.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I am but a humble knight. I cannot exceed my authority...&quot;

Tot: &quot;Is that an honest answer? You may endanger the princess if you
     keep telling yourself that.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;...I shall take note of your counsel.&quot;

[Steiner gets on.]

Tot: &quot;fare you well, Princess!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Take care, Doctor Tot!&quot;

[The gargant leaves.]

Tot: &quot;I must hurry!&quot;

[He runs to the lever.]

Tot: &quot;I just pull the lever...&quot;

[The gargant goes out of sight.]

Tot: &quot;Be safe, Princess...&quot;

[Down the tunnel, on the gargant:]

Marcus: &quot;Finally!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;We can reach Alexandria now...&quot;

Marcus: &quot;You can't even see Treno anymore.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I wonder how long it's going to take? I never dreamed of
        going home in a vehicle like this.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Doctor Tot remains a unique charact--&quot;

Marcus: &quot;!&quot;
Steiner: &quot;!&quot;

[The gargant stops.]

Steiner: &quot;Wh-What's wrong?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;It's hesitating. !!!

[Dagger jumps out.]

Steiner: &quot;Princess!&quot;

[A large snake-type monster is coiled in the passage, and they run
to fight it.]

Dagger: &quot;Could this be the reason?&quot;

[The party fights the monster and chases it away. They get back in
the gargant's carriage and continue to Alexandria, coming to a station
like the one in Treno.]

Marcus: &quot;We're finally here.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I think the gargant is tired, too.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I never knew such a place existed in Alexandria...&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Where are we?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Let's keep moving!&quot;

[They walk into the next room.]

Marcus: &quot;Is this really Alexandria?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Well, it must be!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;How do we get out?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Hmm... Well... This way! Princess, let us make haste.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Wait, Steiner! I know this place. Doctor Tot told me about
        this place. My ancestors built this place to keep enemies from
        invading. Doctor Tot also said...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess! We can hear your stories later! The stale air
         cannot be good for us!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;And we gotta save Blank!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Right. We need to hurry. Let's go Steiner.&quot;

[Dagger and Marcus walk to where Steiner had walked to, and a gate
rises up, blocking their path. Steiner looks at Marcus.]

Steiner: &quot;You! What kind of trick is this!?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;I didn't do anything! Don't blame me.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;You really didn't do anything!?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;You don't believe me!?&quot;

[A gate rises up behind them, trapping them in a small space.]

Marcus: &quot;Look, we missed our chance to escape.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Graaagh!&quot;

[Zorn walks out on one side and looks down at them.]

Zorn: &quot;They fell for it!&quot;

[Thorn walks on the other side.]

Thorn: &quot;Fell for it, they did!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Zorn! Thorn! I am Steiner, Captain of the Knights of Pluto!
         I have returned! Let us out at once!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Too bad, it is.&quot;

Zorn: &quot;You're all under arrest.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zorn! Thorn! I've returned to Alexandria to speak with my
        mother. Take me to my mother!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Yes, we will take you to Queen Brahne, whether you like it or not.&quot;

Thorn: &quot;'Capture Princess Garnet,' Queen Brahne said. Ordered us, she did.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What!?&quot;
Steiner: &quot;Lies!&quot;
Marcus: &quot;What's going on!?&quot;

[The screen blacks out, and control switches over to Zidane's party
which is still in Burmecia.]

Zidane: &quot;Can you stand, Freya?&quot;

Freya: &quot;It is nothing.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Take it easy, okay? How 'bout you, Vivi?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Y-Yeah, I'm alright...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So what now, people? They said they were going to Cleyra.&quot;

Freya: &quot;We have no choice! We must go to Cleyra, too!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I knew you'd say that! You coming, Vivi?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Um... Do you think we'll learn more about those black mages
      if we go to Cleyra?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, I'd say we'll learn a lot about them as long as we
        follow Brahne and that Kuja guy.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Then I'm with you!&quot;

Quina: &quot;Cleyra...? Sound yummy. I go with you!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;O-Oh, and what about the princess?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dagger? I'd never forget about her! She might not be here
        in Burmecia, but I know we'll find her soon. Well, let's move
        out!&quot;

Freya: &quot;Some say it lies in the desert west of Burmecia, but I know
       not whether we can enter the town itself.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Brighten up a little! We'll figure it out when we get there!&quot;

[The screen blacks out.]

Zidane: (Oh, dagger! Where could you be!?)

[On the world map, the party goes to the whirlwind's base.]

===========================================================
18. Cleyra (CL01)
===========================================================

[The party walks up at the bottom of the trunk, braving the intense
sand being blown into their faces.]

Freya: &quot;The tempest subsides... By the gods!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;C'mon, let's go while we can!&quot;

Freya: &quot;Indeed. Let us press on.&quot;

Quina: &quot;Must hurry. Must find yummy-yummies!&quot;

[The party climbs up the tree trunk with great effort, and finally
reaches Cleyra's settlement. Some veiled rat-people are at the
entrance.]

Forest Oracle Kildea: &quot;Might you be Lady Freya?&quot;

Freya: &quot;Indeed, I am.&quot;

Sand Oracle Safrea: &quot;We have awaited your coming, my lady.&quot;

Freya: &quot;How did you come to know my identity?&quot;

Forest Oracle Kildea: &quot;The king of Burmecia has requested that we
                      guide you to him.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Long live the king! Take me to him immediately!&quot;

Sand Oracle Safrea: &quot;At once, my lady.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Zidane, I shall go to see the king. Why not take this chance
       to rest?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, good idea.&quot;

Sand Oracle Safrea: &quot;This way, my lady.&quot;

[The two walk off.]

Forest Oracle Kildea: &quot;Allow me to be your guide and show you our town.&quot;
                      R1 --&gt; Yes, please
                      R2 --&gt; No thanks

                      R1: &quot;Please walk this way, sirs.&quot;

                          Quina: &quot;I go find yummy-yummies by myself!&quot;

                      R2: &quot;I see... I am sorry that I cannot be of any
                          service.&quot;

                          Zidane: &quot;Kinda strange place, don't ya think?
                                  Hey, Vivi and Quina, let's just poke
                                  around the town a little, okay?&quot;

                          Vivi: &quot;Uh...okay. Let's.&quot;

                          Quina: &quot;I go search for tasty munchies!&quot;

[Zidane walks around town and, after receiving a message from a guard
at the cathedral that Freya wanted them to wait at the inn, he heads
back. However, before he can reach it, Burmecian Soldier Dan runs up
the stairs, yelling.]

Burmecian Soldier Dan: &quot;Help!!!&quot;

[The night oracle comes out of the inn.]

Night Oracle Donnegan: &quot;What is the matter?&quot;

Burmecian Soldier Dan: &quot;Th-The antlion's mauling a kid!&quot;

Night Oracle Donnegan: &quot;The antlion!? It is usually so docile...
                       How could--&quot;

Burmecian Soldier Dan: &quot;We gotta teach that beast a lesson!&quot;

Night Oracle Donnegan: &quot;This calls for immediate action. I shall
                       inform the high priest at once.&quot;

[Donnegan walks away slowly.]

Burmecian Soldier Dan: &quot;Hey, buddy, wh-where ya going? These Cleyrans
                       are all so damn lazy! You there! Gimme a hand
                       if you think you're good enough!&quot;

[At the antlion pit, Vivi and Quina are already there. The antlion is
a large frightening-looking monster with a large pair of pincers.]

Zidane: &quot;So that's the antlion!&quot;

[The Rat Kid from Alexandria is there, dangling off a sharp claw.]

Puck: &quot;Aaaa! Help me!!!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;NO!!!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hang in there, champ! We're gonna save you!

[Freya arrives.]

Freya: &quot;Is the child alright, Zidane?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, he's fine.&quot;

Puck: &quot;Like hell, I'm fine!!&quot;

Freya: &quot;That voice! Might it be Prince Puck!?&quot;

Puck: &quot;Freya! Where you been!?&quot;

Antlion: &quot;Urgurrrra!&quot;

Puck: &quot;Aaaaaaa!&quot;

[The antlion throws puck at Freya and Zidane.]

Puck: &quot;Oww! That hurt, ya stupid jerk!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Here it comes!&quot;

[The antlion attacks but is repelled by the party. It sinks, wounded,
into the sandpit and disappears from sight.]

Freya: &quot;Are you alright, Your Highness?&quot;

Puck: &quot;Hey, Freya! Whassup?&quot;

Freya: &quot;But how can this be? I heard that Your Highness disappeared
       upon leaving Burmecia...&quot;

Puck: &quot;Uh...yeah!&quot;

Freya: &quot;Well, let us go at once to the catheral to inform His Majesty!&quot;

Puck: &quot;My old man, huh? Nah, I don't want to see him! Just tell him I
      said hi, okay? Later!&quot;

Freya: &quot;But, Your Highness!!!&quot;

[Puck runs off the runs back to say:]

Puck: &quot;Take care, Vivi!&quot;

[...then runs off.]

Quina: &quot;He so rude. Vivi much nicer.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;He's the first friend I ever had. I've gotta tell him something!&quot;

[Vivi runs off and the screen blacks out. Up in the cathedral, the
party members talk with the king of Burmecia.]

King of Burmecia: &quot;I see. So you saw Puck, eh?&quot;

Freya: &quot;As mischievous as ever, Your Majesty.&quot;

King of Burmecia: &quot;I haven't seen him in ages.&quot;

Freya: &quot;I heard his Highness left Burmecia one month after me. That
       makes it three years.&quot;

King of Burmecia: &quot;And yet both you and Puck decided to return to me
                  in this time of danger. I am grateful!&quot;

Cleyran High Priest: &quot;Freya, we shall conduct an ancient ceremony to
                     strengthen the sandstorm. Surely, no enemy of
                     ours would attack with the powerful sandstorm
                     protecting Cleyra. And with the help of a dragon
                     knight like you, the storm should grow even more
                     powerful.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Ah, the ceremony from the time when Burmecia and Cleyra were
       one. I understand. Zidane, I met with utter failure when trying
       to defend Burmecia... And I will not allow Brahne to exert her
       will upon us any longer!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You've changed, Freya. I didn't think you were so strong when
        I first met you.&quot;

Freya: &quot;I could not bring peace to Burmecia and thus fulfill Sir
       Fratley's wish. But now, all I can do is protect this beautiful
       place.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, protecting Cleyra is the best thing you can do for
        yourself.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Doing so will help me.&quot;

[Zidane walks aside and lets Freya stand with the maidens dancing.
The harp player flicks the strings and they begin to the strengthening
dance. Towards the end, though, the strings break.]

Moon Maiden Claire: &quot;The strings have snapped... A terrible omen, this
                    is...&quot;

[FMV. The sandstorm surrounding Cleyra melts away, revealing the
gigantic tree for all to see. A terrible omen, indeed.]

Zidane: &quot;I can't believe the sandstorm disappeared. What happened...?&quot;

Freya: &quot;I don't know...&quot;

Cleyran High Priest: &quot;I have never witnessed anything like this since
                     we settled here. On the harp, there is a magic
                     stone. Since ancient times we have used the magic
                     stone to control the sandstorm.&quot;

King of Burmecia: &quot;Perhaps someone is trying to invade Cleyra.&quot;

Cleyran High Priest: &quot;I fear you may be right, my lord.&quot;

King of Burmecia: &quot;I only hope our enemies don't come up the trunk...&quot;

[The view changes and focuses back to somewhere in Alexandria, where
Steiner and Marcus are locked in a suspended cage, watched by guards.]

Steiner: &quot;How dare they imprison us like this! Those wretched court
         jesters! Zorn and Thorn will never get away with this!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;I can't believe I got dragged into this.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;No one asked you to meddle in our affairs!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;It's pretty sad, gettin' backstabbed by your own queen.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;This is all some kind of mistake! I know the queen! She
         would never betray me!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Wishful thinking! Who knows what she's gonna do to the
        princess...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;...... I must save the princess at all costs!&quot;

[Elsewhere, the princess sits alone in her room.]

Dagger: &quot;I wonder if Mother will even listen to me... Why did she
        attack Burmecia? And why did she arrest us like this? I must
        be sincere with her. She hasn't been herself lately...
        Actually, she's been acting rather strange since my birthday
        last year. The same day that tall man visited us... Maybe he
        had something to do with it... Come to think of it, that was
        when things began to change. Doctor Tot left Alexandria shortly
        afterwards, too. What happened that day?&quot;

[Zorn and Thorn run into the room.]

Zorn: &quot;Queen Brahne summons you!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Come with us!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What!? How dare you speak to me like that!?&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Quiet!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;With us, you are coming, and that is that!&quot;

Dagger: (What was that phrase...? Oh yeah.) &quot;Get off me, you scumbag!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;What was that? I do not understand.&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Understand what said, I do not, either.&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Enough! Now come with us!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;Enough! Now come with us!&quot;

[Zorn and Thorn take Dagger to the Queen's room.]

Zorn: &quot;Hurry up!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;For so long, the queen has waited.&quot;

[Dagger enters and bows.]

Dagger: &quot;Mother...&quot;

Brahne: &quot;Darling, there you are. Where were you? I've been worried
        sick. Here, come closer.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Mother, there is something I need to ask you.&quot;

Brahne: &quot;What is it, darling? I will tell you anything you wish to know.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Did you... Is it true that you are responsible for the
        destruction of Burmecia?&quot;

Brahne: &quot;Oh... Well, no wonder you look so concerned. That is far from
        the truth, Garnet. You see, those Burmecian rats have been
        planning to destroy Alexandria for some time. I couldn't just
        wait for them to attack and destroy our precious kingdom. So,
        I had no choice but to take the initiative.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Mother, is that really the truth?&quot;

Brahne: &quot;Of course. I wouldn never lie to you.&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Believe her
        R2 --&gt; Don't believe her.

        R1 (Dagger): &quot;Alright... I'm sorry, Mother.&quot;

            Brahne: &quot;It's okay, darling. I'm just happy you understand.&quot;

        R2 (Dagger): &quot;I don't believe you!&quot;

           Brahne: &quot;Oh, darling, what's wrong? Why wouldn't you believe
                   your own mother?&quot;

[Kuja enters.]

Kuja: &quot;May I play a part in this act?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Act?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Yes, an act from a beautiful play... There is a knight on a
      white horse.. ...and a beautiful princess. It is a tale of tragic
      love. Overcome by grief, the princess must sleep for a hundred
      years...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;You... I've seen you before...&quot;

Kuja: &quot;It appears we were destined to meet again. My sweet angel, come
      to me. I will take you to a world of dreams.&quot;

[Kuja waves his hand and magic puts Dagger to sleep.]

Kuja: &quot;She is beautiful, even in sleep.&quot;

Brahne: &quot;Hmph, impudent little girl. Zorn, Thorn! Prepare to extract
        the eidolons from Garnet.&quot;

[Sometime after, deep in the castle bowels, Zorn and Thorn hover over
a sleeping Garnet, lying on a raised platform.]

Zorn: &quot;A belated happy birthday, Princess. Hee-hee-heee!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Sixteen years old, the princess has become. Draw the eidolons
       from her, finally, we can.&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Eidolons of eternal life!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;Eidolons of eternal power!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Depart after a 16 year sleep!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;Depart after a 16 year wait!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Let there be light!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;Let there be life!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;The time has come!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;The time is now!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Come forth!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;Odin, warrior of the dark!&quot;

[Garnet levitates as magic is extracted from her, in the form of the
eidolon Odin. The screen fades out and back into Cleyra, where Zidane
walks to the observatory where Freya gazes out.]

Zidane: &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

Freya: &quot;Tell me. Why do you think the sandstorm disappeared?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I don't know. I was surprised that there even was a sandstorm.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Did you know the sandstorm was here for a thousand years...?
       And in all that time, it never disappeared, not even once.
       Perhaps Brahne is behind all this.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;......&quot;
        R1 --&gt; No doubt; Brahne is behind this
        R2 --&gt; What about that guy that was with Brahne?
        R3 --&gt; Right now, my mind's only on Dagger

        R1: &quot;It's gotta be Brahne.&quot;

            Freya: &quot;I thought you might feel the same way.&quot;

        R2: &quot;Actually, I'm more concerned about who that guy with
            Brahne in Burmecia was.&quot;

            Freya: &quot;That man... I wonder who he was...&quot;

        R3: &quot;Who cares? Dagger's the only thing on my mind right now.&quot;

            Freya: &quot;That girl... She's Brahne's daughter.&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;Yeah. So what?&quot;

[After picking whatever option:]

Freya: &quot;...... Zidane, I'm going to head down to find out why the
       sandstorm disappeared.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, I was thinking the same thing! Let's go together. I'm
        gonna find Vivi and Quina. I'll meet you at the town entrance.&quot;

[Freya goes down to the entrance after awhile.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, what took you so long? Alright, let's get going.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I couldn't find Puck... I wonder if he went down the trunk?&quot;

Quina: &quot;This city have very yummy sand! This city delicious.&quot;

Freya: &quot;I failed Burmecia...but I won't fail Cleyra, no matter what.&quot;

[The party heads down into the lower tunnels and encounter some fairly
familiar troops.]

Zidane: &quot;Alexandrian soldiers!&quot;

[The party defeats groups of soldiers en route to the bridge. When
they arrive, Freya stops the group.]

Freya: &quot;A moment, Zidane. Those Alexadrian soldiers back there...
       Weren't they too few in number to constitute a determined
       attack?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Well...&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Yeah, I thought so, too
        R2 --&gt; Let's wipe 'em out!

        R1: &quot;Yeah, I thought so, too.&quot;

            Voice: &quot;Bingo!&quot;

        R2: &quot;Let's wipe 'em out!

            Voice: &quot;Moron!&quot;

[Puck runs into Vivi.]

Puck: &quot;Ow! Freya! The town's in trouble! Ya gotta come back, please!&quot;

Freya: &quot;No! My fears were true! At once, my lord!&quot;

Puck: &quot;C'mon, you deadweights! Hustle!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You heard him! Let's go!&quot;

[They run back the way they came, just missing Beatrix' appearance.]

Beatrix: &quot;Ha! They fell for it!&quot;

[In town, mages are teleporting in and attacking the citizenry.]

Burmecian Soldier Dan: &quot;How dare you show up here! Ungah!&quot;

[A mage kills Dan, and two more mages take out some oracles.]

Black Mage: &quot;KILL!&quot;
Black Mage: &quot;KILL!&quot;

[Meanwhile, at the entrance, Mopli, Sharon, and Shannon are running
down to get away from the violence just as the party arrives.]

Mopli: &quot;Kupo!

Flower Maiden Sharon: &quot;Please save us!!!&quot;
Water Maiden Shannon: &quot;The town is full of demons!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Are there really that many!?&quot;

Flower Maiden Sharon: &quot;They just keep coming!&quot;

[One teleports in just then.]

Flower Maiden Sharon: &quot;Aaa!&quot;
Water Maiden Shannon: &quot;Aaa!&quot;

Black Mage: &quot;KILL!&quot;

[They slay the black mage.]

Flower Maiden Sharon: &quot;Aaa!&quot;
Water Maiden Shannon: &quot;Aaa!&quot;

[Some soldiers have breached the town gates.]

Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;Foolish Cleyrans, your time has come!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Over here! I'm the one you want!&quot;

[He slays the three soldiers.]

Zidane: &quot;This must be the main attack force...&quot;

[Two mages warp in.]

Black Mage: &quot;KILL!&quot;
Black Mage: &quot;KILL!&quot;

[Zidane schools 'em.]

Zidane: &quot;Ha! They got nothin' on me! But the town's in trouble!&quot;

[Zidane runs up and finds two clerics.]

Zidane: &quot;Enemies are on their way up! How about your side?&quot;

Tree Oracle Wylan: &quot;The Burmecians are fighting back, but the demons
                   keep coming...&quot;

Sand Oracle Safrea: &quot;We fled, unable to resist any longer...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Damn those Alexandrians!

Sand Oracle Safrea: &quot;What are we to do...?&quot;
Tree Oracle Wylan: &quot;What are we to do...?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We're out of time!&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Let's head up!
        R2 --&gt; Let's head right!

        R1: &quot;Let's head up!&quot;

            [A black mage warps in...]

            Black Mage: &quot;KILL!&quot;

            [...and kills Wylan and Safrea.]

            Zidane: &quot;Not again!&quot;

            [Zidane fights and slays the mage.]

            Zidane: &quot;They're after the king and the high priest!&quot;

        R2: &quot;Let's head to the right!&quot;

            [They all go into the right screen.]

[Zidane heads right into the inn front area. Jack, Adam, and Learie
are running down the stairs towards him.]

Burmecian Refugee Learie: &quot;Excuse me... Have you seen my husband?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;No, I sure haven't...&quot;

Burmecian Kid: &quot;Daddy's gone!&quot;

Burmecian Kid: &quot;Waaaah!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It's too dangerous here!&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Let's go left!
        R2 --&gt; Climb the stairs to the right!

        R1: &quot;Let's go left!&quot;
            [Zidane slays the mages/soldiers.]
            Zidane: &quot;We gotta be fast, or we'll lose them all!&quot;
            [Zidane follows them into the next screen, safely.]

        R2: &quot;Climb the stairs on the right!&quot;
            [A black mage teleports in...]
            Black Mage: &quot;KILL!&quot;
            Zidane: &quot;We can't go that way! Here, let's try this way!&quot;
            [The black mages close in.]
            Zidane: &quot;Bring it on!&quot;
            Burmecian Refugee Learie: &quot;Was my husband...killed by these
                                      demons...?&quot;
            Zidane: &quot;Come on! Let's get outta here!!!&quot;
            Burmecian Refugee Learie: &quot;You did kill him, didn't you!?
            Zidane: &quot;Look out!&quot;
            Burmecian Refugee Learie: &quot;Aaah!&quot;
            [...screams Learie as she's firebomb'd by the mages.]
            Zidane: &quot;Dammit! You bastards!
            [He kills the mages.]
            Zidane: &quot;How the heck am I supposed to save these people!?&quot;

[Zidane runs to the windmill area.]

Burmecian Kid Jack: &quot;Hurry, tell us!

Burmecian Kid Adam: &quot;Which way now!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Let's see...&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Up the stairs!
        R2 --&gt; Cross the bridge to the right!
        R3 --&gt; Down the stairs to the left!

        R1: &quot;Up the stairs!&quot;
            [A mage comes down and says its signature line.]
            Zidane: &quot;I'll hold them off! You guys run ahead, now!&quot;
            Burmecian Refugee Learie: &quot;Please, see my children to safety...&quot;
            Zidane: &quot;You're out of your mind!&quot;
            Burmecian Refuge Learie: &quot;For him!&quot; [She races at the mage.]
            [The mage kills Learie.]
            Zidane: &quot;You heartless bastards! [He slays the mages.]
            Zidane: &quot;Don't worry! I'll protect your children!&quot;
            [Zidane runs to the right.]

        R2: &quot;Cross the bridge!&quot;
            [The civilians escape, but soldiers advance.]
            Zidane: &quot;Persistant bastards!&quot;
            [Zidane kills 'em.]
            Zidane: &quot;We can't hold them off forever!&quot;

        R3: &quot;Down the stairs!&quot;
            [Alexandrian soldiers run up.]
            Zidane: &quot;Nothing'll happen to Cleyra as long as I'm here!&quot;
            [He defeats the soldiers.]
            Zidane: &quot;This area's too dangerous! Let's get out of here!&quot;
            [They head to the right bridge.]

[In the next area:]

Burmecian Kid: &quot;Are we safe now?&quot;

Burmecian Kid: &quot;No more monsters?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hmm...&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Yeah, they won't come back
        R2 --&gt; We're not safe yet

        R1: &quot;Yeah, they won't come back.&quot;

            Burmecian Kid: &quot;Alright!&quot;
            Burmecian Kid: &quot;Yeah!&quot;

            Flower Maiden Sharon: &quot;Have we really seen the last of them?&quot;

        R2: &quot;We're not safe yet... So stay alert for more!&quot;

            Burmecian Kid: &quot;Waaa!!!&quot;
            Burmecian Kid: &quot;No!&quot;

            Flower Maiden Sharon: &quot;I knew it wasn't over yet.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Huh? What are you guys still doing here?&quot;

Water Maiden Shannon: &quot;We like this place very much.&quot;

Flower Maiden Sharon: &quot;Even though we have lost the soul-
                      soothing view of the sandstorm...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, I think it's pretty, too. This whole town is pretty.
        And everyone here is so nice. That's why I wanna protect you!
        C'mon, let's head to the cathedral. We can make our stand there!&quot;

[They all run to the cathedral's front.]

Zidane: &quot;So, these are the only survivors...&quot;

Flower Maiden Sharon: &quot;Where is the high priest?&quot;

Water Maiden Shannon: &quot;Where is the king?&quot;

Burmecian Kid: &quot;Where's dad?&quot;

Burmecian Kid: &quot;Waaa!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I hope they're all safe inside the cathedral... Alright,
        everyone inside!&quot;

[They start to head in, but a black mage comes down.]

Zidane: &quot;They're back!&quot;

Water Maiden Shannon: &quot;Yeeow!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Over there!&quot;

[A mage lands in front of Shannon. Sharon runs, but a mage blocks her
way out, too.]

Zidane: &quot;Dammit! We're surrounded!

Black Mage: &quot;KILL!&quot;
Black Mage: &quot;KILL!&quot;
Black Mage: &quot;KILL!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dammit! I can't save 'em all!&quot;

Voice: &quot;Minions of evil, you have gone too far!&quot;

[Someone stands atop the cathedral's spire, with a dragon lance.]

Stranger: &quot;My spear will purge the land of you! You shall fall like
          leaves in the wind under the force of my blade!&quot;

[The man jumps around and cuts down the black mages.]

Stranger: &quot;Now, run!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dunno who you are, but I owe you one!&quot;

[Inside the cathedral, Freya talks with the Stranger.]

Freya: &quot;Sir Fratley, I... I have missed you so much... I began my
       search for you immediately after you left Burmecia. Where have
       you been all these years...? To what corners of the world have
       you traveled? My dear Fratley... I climbed the highest mountains
       only to hear rumors of your victories... I searched the deepest
       valleys only to find your footsteps. But I never found you. And
       in the end, I heard something... Something unbearable!&quot;

Fratley: &quot;Freya, you say? I believe this is the first time we have met...&quot;

Freya: &quot;What...did you just say?&quot;

Fratley: &quot;I'm sorry, but I cannot remember you for the life of me...&quot;

Freya: &quot;Y-You jest! You cannot have forgotten me! It's me, Freya!
       Freya of Burmecia!!&quot;

Fratley: &quot;I am sorry...&quot;

Freya: &quot;No...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wait a minute! You can't be serious! It's Freya, your lost
        love! How could you forget her!? Well, say something!!!&quot;

Freya: &quot;That is enough, Zidane...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What!!!? You've been searching for this guy for years, and
        now he's right here!&quot;

King of Burmecia: &quot;Fratley! Do you remember me, the King of Burmecia?&quot;

Fratley: &quot;Not at all, I'm afraid.&quot;

King of Burmecia: &quot;Impossible! Have you forgotten everything that has
                  passed!? Then let me ask you this: What brought you
                  back to Burmecia? Is it not because you learned of
                  the crisis in Cleyra, whose people are our brothers?&quot;

Fratley: &quot;As a matter of fact...&quot;

Voice: &quot;As a matter of fact, I'll tell ya!&quot;

[Puck runs in.]

Zidane: &quot;Puck!&quot;
Freya: &quot;Prince Puck!&quot;
Fratley: &quot;Lord Puck!&quot;
King of Burmecia: &quot;Puck!&quot;

Puck: &quot;I found Fratley during my travels around the world! And you
      guessed it, he didn't know who I was! Or even who he was! But
      when Burmecia was attacked and he heard that Cleyra was in
      danger... His faint memories as a dragon knight called him back
      here!&quot;

Fratley: &quot;Dragon knight... Yes, I was once called that... But now,
         that is all I can remember...&quot;

Freya: &quot;Fratley...&quot;

Fratley: &quot;I must go.&quot;

[Fratley disappears in a single bound.]

Zidane: &quot;Freya, aren't you gonna follow him?&quot;

Freya: &quot;No... I am happy simply knowing Sir Fratley still lives.&quot;

Puck: &quot;I'm sorry, Freya. I knew you weren't ready to see him, but
      with Cleyra under attack and all...&quot;

Freya: &quot;I need no such courtesy, Your Highness.&quot;

Puck: &quot;Uh...well, I'm gonna go after Fratley! Later!&quot;

[Puck runs off.]

King of Burmecia: &quot;Wait, Puck! I haven't seen you in ages!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Wh-What? That was Puck? So what happened? What's the matter,
      Freya? Are you crying?&quot;

Freya: &quot;Ahahaha... What irony. To find the man about whom I have
       dreamt endlessly... ...only to discover that he cannot even
       remember who I am! Come, Zidane! The enemy's hand has not been
       stilled!&quot; We must regroup!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Freya...&quot;

Voice: &quot;Eeeeek!&quot;

[Everyone turns around to see Beatrix' sword pointed at the high priest.]

Cleyran High Priest: &quot;Eeeeek! Have mercy!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Hmph! Pathetic rodents! You fail to grasp the true power
         of this jewel!&quot;

[Beatrix cuts it loose and takes it.]

Cleyran High Priest: &quot;Our magic stone!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Now that I have this jewel, I am through with your city!

Zidane: &quot;Wait!&quot;
Freya: &quot;Halt, villain!&quot;

[Beatrix runs through the lobby and out to the cathedral front; the
party follows in kind.]

Zidane: &quot;Think you can get away?&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Get away? Hahaha. You're a bigger fool than I imagined...
         Have you forgotten how badly I beat you back in Burmecia?&quot;

Freya: &quot;So, you are more of a fool for not finishing what you started!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;You're gonna pay!&quot;

Quina: &quot;I find no tasties in this town, so we cook you for breakfast!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Then allow me to shatter your delusions of grandeur.&quot;

[The party fights Beatrix, but once again...]

Beatrix: &quot;No more games.&quot;

[She uses Stock Break to put everyone in critical condition.]

Beatrix: &quot;I shall leave with the jewel now.&quot;

[The battle ends.]

Zidane: &quot;She's t-too powerful!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Black mages, our work here is done. Commence withdrawal
         immediately!

[A black mage jumps into a teleport sphere, along with Beatrix, and
it soars away into the sky.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, they disappeared! What now, Freya?&quot;

Freya: &quot;Good question... Zidane! Look out behind you!&quot;

[A black mage has wandered up, but it only jumps into a teleport
sphere.]

Zidane: &quot;There! I'm gonna follow 'em! Everyone follow me!&quot;

[Zidane jumps into the sphere before it dissipates, and he zooms
off into the horizon, too.]

Vivi: &quot;Zidane! He's gone!&quot;

Freya: &quot;I highly doubt I will return to this place... Besides, this
       may be your last chance to find the truth abou who you are...
       Come, Vivi! Show us your courage!&quot;

[Freya jumps into the next teleport sphere.]

Vivi: &quot;Oh no... Freya's gone, too!&quot;

[Vivi jumps into the next teleport sphere and leaves.]

Quina: &quot;I no like heights...&quot;

[Quina hightails it out of there. Meanwhile, up on an airship looming
over Cleyra somewhere, Brahne sits on the front deck.]

Brahne: &quot;It's time... Without her summoning powers, Garnet is helpless.
        With this Dark Matter, I now hold the power to summon an
        eidolon. Now, I'll find out if Kuja's claims are true. Odin,
        come to me!!!&quot;

[FMV. The frightening eidolon Odin appears on his horse Sleipner and
throws his lance into the tree-town below, literally ripping it apart.
Odin fades away afterwards. Meanwhile, Freya, Vivi, and Zidane have
landed on the same ship.]

===========================================================
19. Red Rose (RR01)
===========================================================

Zidane: &quot;Geez... Did you see that!?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Cleyra...Puck...Quina... They're all gone...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dammit! Oh yeah! What happened to Beatrix!? I'll bet she's
        on this ship!

[Zidane runs to the stairs and beckons the others. Freya stays put.]

Vivi: &quot;Freya... I think Zidane's calling for us.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Please... Leave me alone...&quot;

[Zidane runs over.]

Zidane: &quot;We have to get behind the stairs! Someone's coming!&quot;

[Freya manages to get out of sight with the others. Beatrix emerges
from one of the rooms and sees a soldier.]

Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;Welcome back, General!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;How is Her Majesty?&quot;

Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;She has eagerly awaited your return. I am certain
                     she will shower you with praise for our victory.
                     Your supremacy is without question now. Steiner
                     and his Knights of Pluto are nothing compared to
                     you!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;That is enough!&quot;

Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;Forgive me, General.&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Tell Her Majesty that I will report to her shortly.&quot;

[The guard salutes and walks off.]

Beatrix: &quot;That was ridiculous... My troops alone would've been more
         than enough to take Cleyra. Why does the queen insist on
         using black mages and eidolons? I didn't train all these
         years so that I could take a backseat to anyone...&quot;

[A soldier (the same?) comes near Beatrix and turns back to the door.]

Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;This way! Hurry up! You three, et on the telepod
                     and go to Alexandria immediately!&quot;

[Beatrix watches three black mages walk away with the soldier.]

Beatrix: &quot;...There's no difference between them and me. We're all just
         blindly following orders. My heart and my will mean nothing...
         Maybe Steiner was right...&quot;

[Beatrix walks away.]

Zidane: &quot;Did you hear that? Looks like Brahne's onboard this ship.&quot;

[The party runs to a cabin door, and Zidane looks in.]

Freya: &quot;Can you see anything?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...... It's too dark. I can't see anything.&quot;

Voice: &quot;Beatrix!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;That's her!&quot;
Freya: &quot;That's her!&quot;
Zidane: &quot;That's her!&quot;

[Inside the cabin, Beatrix walks to Brahne.]

Brahne: &quot;Did you get the item!?&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Is this it, Your Majesty?&quot;

[Brahne takes it from her hand.]

Brahne: &quot;Yes! This is it! Hahaha! With this, I can finally... ...No.
        I need one more! I must get the last jewel!&quot;

[Beatrix speaks under her breath.]

Beatrix: &quot;Not even a word of gratitude...&quot;

Brahne: &quot;Beatrix! Go find the last jewel!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;...Yes, Your Majesty. By the way, how is the princess doing?&quot;

Brahne: &quot;Garnet... We have drawn all the eidolons from her. She is no
        longer of any use to me.&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;What do you mean, Your Majesty?&quot;

Brahne: &quot;Garnet has committed a crime. She will be executed for
        stealing the jewel.&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;What?&quot;

Brahne: &quot;Don't make me repeat myself! When we get back to Alexandria,
        I'll have Garnet beheaded! Now, go! Find the last jewel!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Your Majesty...&quot;

Brahne: &quot;Hahahahaha!&quot;

[Outside the door:]

Zidane: &quot;Dagger!!!&quot;

Freya: &quot;Calm down! Fighting them now would be senseless. They still
       have Garnet in custody.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So what are you saying!? We should just stand here!? We've
        got to get to Alexandria before Brahne! That's the only way!
        The only question is how...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Zidane, follow me!&quot;

Freya: &quot;Vivi! Where are you going!?

[Zidane chases after Freya and Vivi back to the pod deck.]

Vivi: &quot;Remember how that soldier was talking about using these pods
      to go to Alexandria?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh yeah...&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Alright, let's try using the pods
        R2 --&gt; Let me think it over

        R1: &quot;Alright, let's try it.&quot;

            [They all jump in the pods.]

            Zidane: &quot;Well, here goes nothing! Dagger! I'm coming!&quot;

            [The pods fly out towards Alexandria.]

        R2: [Nothing is done yet.]

[After R1, the view changes to Steiner and Marcus inside their
little cage in the Alexandrian castle depths.]

Steiner: &quot;The time has come to escape!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;How?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;...I don't know! But we must do something!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Wait, I have an idea. Press (d-left) or (d-right) to shift
        your center of gravity!&quot;

[Steiner tries it.]

Marcus: &quot;There you go.&quot;

[The two build up a momentum so that the cage hits a railing and
breaks, letting the two of them out.]

Steiner: &quot;Princess, I'm coming!

[The party runs by/defeats the guards around and emerges from a
secret staircase in the castle floor.]

Steiner: &quot;Princess!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;I'm outta here. I'm goin' to Evil Forest to save my bro.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;You heartless cur! Huh? What was that!?&quot;

[Zidane, Freya, and Vivi warp in to that exact location after Marcus
has left.]

Steiner: &quot;You!!! Wh-What are you doing here!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Steiner! Is this Alexandria!?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;What!? I have no time for your silly questions! I must
         escape this wretched dungeon of Alexandria and rescue the
         princess!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Enough said! Let's go!&quot;

[The three run off.]

Steiner: &quot;Why is everyone leaving me behind!?&quot;

[The three run back.]

Zidane: &quot;Hurry up, Rusty! Dagger's life is in danger!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;What are you talking about!? Enough with your nonsense!!!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;It's true. We were just on the Red Rose, and we overheard
      Brahne talking. She said that once she returns to Alexandria,
      she is going to have Dagger executed.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;...Is this really true?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah!!! We've got 30 minutes before Brahne arrives! Let's go!&quot;

[The party runs out of the dungeon area and sees Marcus.]

Zidane: &quot;Marcus!?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Watch out. I'm closin' the gate.&quot;

[He drops a portcullis before any guards can get at them.]

Zidane: &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;It's a long story. I'm gonna go to Evil Forest and help
        Blank.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Good luck! We're gonna go find Dagger!&quot;

===========================================================</pre><pre id="faqspan-6">
20. Alexandria Castle (AC02)
===========================================================

[Marcus runs off. Zidane searches the castle and they finally make
their way up to the queen's room.]

Zidane: &quot;Where could she be...?&quot;

[Zidane goes to a candle.]

Zidane: &quot;What a weird-looking candle...&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Try to move it
        R2 --&gt; Leave it alone

        R1: [The fireplace pulls back to reveal a stairway.]
        R2: [No action taken.]

[Zidane takes the staircase down to the room where Zorn and Thorn
were extracing the eidolons from Garnet.]

Zidane: &quot;!!!?&quot;

[Zorn and Thorn run all the way over.]

Zorn: &quot;What are you doing here!?&quot;

Thorn: &quot;So meddlesome, you are! Mercy no more!&quot;

[The party whips Zorn and Thorn like the pitiful jesters they are.]

Zorn: &quot;Damn you! We will get you for this!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Matters not to us. Finished with Garnet, we are.&quot;

Zorn: &quot;You are too late!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;You are too late!&quot;

[The party finds the unconscious/sleeping dagger where she had the
eidolons extracted from her.]

Zidane: &quot;Dagger, it's me! Dagger!!! ......&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Oh, no...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;P-PRINCESS!!! NOOOOO!!! Princess, please forgive me!!! I
         don't deserve to be a knight! I don't deserve to live!&quot;

Freya: &quot;Her heart's still beating.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah. I know... Let's get her out of here. Dagger, you're
        gonna be alright.&quot;

[The ATE 'Friendship' plays; afterwards, Zidane picks up Garnet and
runs back to the queen's chamber.]

Freya: &quot;I don't think anyone followed us.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;My queen... Why have you done this...!? I have devoted my
         whole life to serving you and the princess...! Why did you
         harm the princess!!!? Why!!!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Steiner...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Zidane. Do you think she'll ever wake up?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Of course. She's asleep because she's tired. That's all. I
        wanna let Dagger rest a little. Do you guys mind? Thanks.&quot;

[He lies Dagger down on the parlor couch.]

Zidane: &quot;If only I had gotten here sooner... I'm sorry...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;What happened to you? You are not your usual self. Go on...
         Blame my incompetence! Tell me it is my fault!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;No! I can't... I...don't know what I feel right now... I
        can't even shed a tear...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;......&quot;&quot;

[Zorn and Thorn run in...]

Zorn: &quot;There they are! There is no escape!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;There they are! There is no escape!&quot;

[...followed by Beatrix.]

Beatrix: &quot;Welcome back, Steiner. Where have you been all this time?
         Don't tell me you have been enjoying the company of these
         scoundrels.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;What the hell!? The only scoundrels around here are you and
         your fat queen!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Fools like you will never learn.&quot;

[Beatrix fights...]

Beatrix: &quot;I'll kill all enemies of Alexandria!&quot;

[...and pummels the party with Climhazzard (HP--&gt;1).]

Beatrix: &quot;Never step into this land again.&quot;

[The battle ends.]

Beatrix: &quot;Your pathetic powers are useless against me.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Hey, wait a minute... You're the general of this kingdom.
        As the general of Alexandria, what is your sworn duty!? Isn't
        it to protect Dagger--your Princess Garnet? I'm sure you know
        who's sitting over there.&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;It can't be... Princess... ...So, it was true. The queen
         really did mean to kill her...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;WHAT!? No! The queen would never do such a thing!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Steiner, it is time for you to accept the truth. ...My
         heart is set. All this time, I have been mistaken...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I hate to say it, but the lady's right, Rusty. You'd better
        learn to accept it.&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;...Citizens of Burmecia, please forgive me.&quot;

Freya: &quot;It is too late to seek forgiveness! ...But you can still
       save Dagger.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Freya...&quot;

Freya: &quot;I tell you this because I acknowledge your powers. Help your
       princess.&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;I don't know if I can... ...but I will give it a try. I
         hope this will work.&quot;

[Beatrix tries a spell remover.]

Thorn: &quot;Irrevocable is the spell we have cast!

[Beatrix tries it again.]

Zorn: &quot;It is useless!&quot;

[Third time's the charm, and Dagger wakes up.]

Dagger: &quot;...Oh...&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Princess, are you alright?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;...Ohh, my head... What happened...?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dagger!

Vivi: &quot;Yay!&quot;
Steiner: &quot;Princess!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;You're all here.&quot;

Voice: &quot;What is all this ruckus!?&quot;

[Brahne enters the chamber.]

Zorn: &quot;The princess has awakened, Your Majesty!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;Kidnapping the princess, they are, Your Majesty!&quot;

Brahne: &quot;...... Have you extracted all the eidolons from her?&quot;

Zorn: &quot;We have, Your Majesty!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;We have, Your Majesty!&quot;

Brahne: &quot;Then what are you waiting for? Take Garnet and throw her in
        prison!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Yes, Your Majesty!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;Yes, Your Majesty!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;I won't allow that.&quot;

Brahne: &quot;Oh? Are you defying me as well?&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Your Majesty, it is my duty to protect the princess. I beg
         you, reconsider. Please do not harm the princess anymore. All
         of you, leave here at once!&quot;

Freya: &quot;I'm staying! Zidane, go. Now!&quot;

Brahne: &quot;You two are joining forces? How amusing... Get rid of them.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Mother!&quot;

[Brahne stops for a moment and then walks out anyway.]

Zidane: &quot;Freya! Be careful!&quot;

Freya: &quot;Don't worry.

Zidane: &quot;Come on. Let's go!&quot;

[Dagger, Vivi, and Zidane run down into the stairwell behind the
fireplace. Steiner waits a moment, and runs after them.]

Steiner: &quot;Wait!

[Freya and Beatrix stand against Zorn and Thorn, who sic a giant
tongue-wagging dog at 'em.]

Zorn: &quot;Bandersnatch, bite their heads off!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;Bandersnatch, bite their heads off!&quot;

[Freya and Beatrix slay the Bandersnatch. In the stairwell, Zidane
takes Garnet and Vivi down until they find three black mages coming
up the stairs.]

Zidane: &quot;Black mages! Dammit!&quot;

Black Mage: &quot;KILL!&quot;
Black Mage: &quot;KILL!&quot;
Black Mage: &quot;KILL!&quot;

[The party runs down the stairs even further, then Zidane stops.]

Zidane: &quot;Where's Steiner?&quot;

[Steiner is literally walking after them.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey! Hurry up!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;What am I doing here...?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What's the matter?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Beatrix served the queen all these years, and now she is
         turning against her... Freya lost her comrades, yet she
         insists on protecting the princess... The queen will never
         forgive them. She will kill them both... Zidane, I have a
         request.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What? Why are you goin' formal all of a sudden?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I want you to escort the princess out of Alexandria and
         take her to Doctor Tot. I'm sure Doctor Tot can come up with
         a plan to help us and our kingdom.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Piece of cake. I'm an escape artist.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Don't worry, Steiner. We'll get her out there.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Zidane, Master Vivi, I'm counting on you.&quot;

[Steiner runs back towards Freya nad Beatrix.]

Steiner: &quot;Princess, I bid you farewell!&quot;

[...and he's gone.]

Dagger: &quot;Steiner... Everybody is fighting for me...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That's right. They're all fighting for you...and for
        Alexandria... They're moving forward, giving everything they
        got! So we have to move on, just like they are. We can't
        stop now! Come on!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;But...&quot;

[A bandersnatch jumps down near Garnet.]

Zidane: &quot;Damn! We've got company!&quot;

[They pound the pooch.]

Zidane: &quot;Alright, let's go.

[Up in the spiral stairway, Beatrix and Freya are fighting a pair of
bandersnatches.]

Freya: &quot;What do you think!?&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;It's not going to be easy...&quot;

[They lay the two to rest.]

Freya: &quot;They're toughter than I expected...&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;We're not out of danger yet.&quot;

[Steiner runs up the stairway.]

Steiner: &quot;Beatrix! Freya!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Steiner! What are you doing here!?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I am Captain Adelbert Steiner of Alexandria. Grant me the
         honor of assisting you brave knights!&quot;

Freya: &quot;Enough with your babble! Fight!&quot;

[The three kick the dogs around, then the view changes back to Zidane.
They head down towards the Alexandrian gargant station, but they run
into the familiar box-in trap again.]

Zidane: &quot;What the hell!?&quot;

Zorn: &quot;They fell for it again!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Really stupid, they are!&quot;

Zidane; &quot;You bastards!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Bastards, we may be, but clever are we.&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Hee-hee-heee.&quot;

[Marcus sneaks up behind Thorn and punches his lights out.]

Marcus: &quot;Hey, what's up!?&quot;

[Blank kicks Zorn unconscious.]

Blank: &quot;Zidane, are you alright!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Blank!&quot;

[A mini-flashback finds Marcus in Evil Forest, leading Blank on.]

Marcus: &quot;Bro, over here!&quot;

Blank: &quot;Hold up. My body still feels kinda stiff.&quot;

Marcus: &quot;We've gotta hurry! Zidane and Dagger are in trouble!&quot;

Blank: &quot;Who's Dagger? Zidane's new girl?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;What? YOu don't know?&quot;

Blank: &quot;Know what? What are you talking about?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Just keep running!&quot;

Blank: &quot;Sheez...&quot;

[End flashback.]

Blank: &quot;We came here straight from Evil Forest.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Man, I love you guys!&quot;

[Marcus lowers one of the gates.]

Marcus: &quot;Zidane, you can ride the gargant downstairs.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Blank... Marcus...&quot;

Blank: &quot;Get out of here! We'll take care of this! There's more bad
       guys coming!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I owe you guys big-time! Let's get outta here!&quot;

[They run to the station.]

Zidane: &quot;So this is Gargan Roo... Dagger? Are you alright?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Forget I asked. I'm sure you have a lot on your mind...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;There's something coming!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Is this a gargant!? It's huge!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...We're riding this thing?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, let's get going. We have no time to waste. Dagger!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I...I don't know what to do anymore...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh, come on! Why do you think everyone stayed behind!? Yeah,
        they're fighting for you, but also, they know, deep down
        inside, that they have to fight! Beatrix, Freya, Marcus,
        Blank, even Steiner... Sometimes, you can't think everything
        out. You have to listen to your heart.&quot;

[Dagger nods and gets on.]

Zidane: &quot;Alright...&quot;

[The gargant carries the three towards Treno.]

Vivi: &quot;Where are we going?&quot;

Zidane; &quot;We're going to Treno. We'll stay there for the time being
        and try to figure out our next move.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

[The gargant halts.]

Vivi: &quot;Y-Yikes!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;That's--&quot;

]They jump off and see another big snake-thing in the passage.]

Zidane: &quot;Is this what the gargant is scared of?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I think this one's different form the one I ran into! Be careful!&quot;

[They fight and defeat the monster, climbing into the ride afterwards.]

Vivi: &quot;Umph!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It's moving again... But why is it going so slowly? Hey,
        hurry up!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Don't yell at it. The poor thing must be scared to death.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;But it's...&quot;

[It speeds up.]

Zidane: &quot;See? It can go faster. Good job!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;!!! No, Zidane! Look!&quot;

[The monster they had just defeated is chasing after them.]

Zidane: &quot;Dammit, it's chasing us!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;We'll pass Treno if we don't stop soon!&quot;

[They pass the Treno Station with the snake monster on their tail,
still.]

Vivi: &quot;I think we just passed Treno...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dammit! We can't jump off at this speed.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;! Zidane, look!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Huh? What's the... Shoot!!!&quot;

[The Gargant races and crashes out the other end of the tunnel,
wherever that is. In the white screen:]

Dagger: &quot;M-Mother...&quot;

[Cut to the Alexandria Castle throne room.]

Zorn: &quot;Your Majesty!&quot;

[Zorn and Thorn run in, but a guard blocks their way.]

Thorn: &quot;In my way, you are. Step back, underling!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Let us through!&quot;

Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;I have strict orders from the queen not to let
                     either of you through. I shall make any inquiries
                     on your behalf.&quot;

[Zorn and Thorn race to the other side, and are stiff-armed again.]

Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;State your business.&quot;

Zorn: &quot;The queen's guests have arrived.&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Let them come in, shall we?&quot;

Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;I shall inquire. Stay here.&quot;

[She goes to the queen.]

Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;Your Majesty... ...Yes, Your Majesty.&quot;

[The guard goes back to the jesters.]

Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;Let the guests through. You two are dismissed.&quot;

Zorn: &quot;What does that mean?&quot;

Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;Queen Brahne is quite upset with you two for
                     letting the princess escape with the pendant. You
                     should go now.&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Whatever to do are we!?&quot;

Zorn: &quot;We cannot live without the queen's backing! We must first
      tell the guests to come in!&quot;

[The two run out.]

Queen Brahne: &quot;Phew...&quot;

Voice: &quot;What a view.&quot;

[A woman with an axe walks into the room, and is stopped by a guard.]

Boisterous Woman: &quot;Who are you? Out of my way! The queen summoned me.&quot;

Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;Restrain yourself before the queen.&quot;

[A man with a large mop of red hair walks in, too, and pushes past
the guard on the other side of the throne.]

Boisterous Woman: &quot;Do you understand who you're talking to? I'm Lani,
                  the best and most beautiful bounty hunter in the
                  world!&quot;

[Lani walks past the guard.]

Lani: &quot;It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Majesty. I hear things aren't
      going too well.&quot;

Queen Brahne: &quot;Have you no manners? This is what I get for hiring a
              lowlife.&quot;

Lani: &quot;I'm sure you didn't hire me for my manners, Your Majesty.&quot;

Queen Brahne: &quot;Hmph. You have two objectives. The first is to retrieve
              the pendant, a national treasure, from Princess Garnet.
              The other is to assassinate the black mage traveling with
              them.&quot;

Red-headed Man: &quot;...What is that?&quot;

Queen Brahne: &quot;A soulless golem. A defect is running free.&quot;

Lani: &quot;I don't know what happened between you and the princess, but
      what should I do if I meet with resistance?&quot;

Queen Brahne: &quot;Hmph. Just get the pendant back from that wretched girl!&quot;

Lani: &quot;Wonderful. My axe is pleased to hear that. It won't take long.
      Good day, Your Majesty.&quot;

[Lani takes her leave.]

Red-headed Man: &quot;Is it true that a boy with a tail is traveling with
                the princess?&quot;

Queen Brahne: &quot;Yes, that accursed monkey! I shall give you an extra
              reward if you take care of him.&quot;

Red-headed Man: &quot;...I was right. I'll take care of your request after
                I finish him.&quot;

[The red-headed man jumps off the balcony and disappears. A guard runs
in and comes to Brahne's throne.]

Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;Reporting! The Alexandrian fleet has returned to
                     home waters! Please prepare to depart on the Red
                     Rose.&quot;

Queen Brahne: &quot;Ah, finally! We leave immediately! Bwahahahaha!&quot;

===========================================================
21. Pinnacle Rocks (PR01)
===========================================================

Dagger: &quot;Mother... Ugh... Uh... I... Vivi... We made it?&quot;

[Dagger looks over at Vivi, whose sitting on some gargant wreckage.]

Dagger: &quot;Where are we...?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;We're at Pinnacle Rocks. It's supposed to be near Lindblum Castle...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Pinnacle Rocks...? Lindblum...? The gargant took us this far? !
        Where's Freya? Steiner? And Beatrix? And...Zidane?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;He went to check the area.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dagger, you're awake!&quot;

[Zidane jumps down.]

Zidane: &quot;Do you feel okay?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Where is everyone, Zidane?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I don't know... We're really far from Alexandria. Hey, don't
        worry. The Tantalus guys are with them, too. It's almost
        nightfall. They're probably in Treno by now.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Do you think we can borrow an airship in Lindblum? Treno is
        only steps away if we can reach South Gate.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah...&quot;

[A floating old man appears before them.]

Zidane: &quot;Are you our enemy?&quot;

Old Man: &quot;That is up to you... My name is Ramuh.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I've heard your name somewhere... ! I've seen your name in
        a book I read about summoning magic... You must be Ramuh, the
        Thunder God.&quot;

Ramuh: &quot;...Do you know that your summon magic destroyed Cleyra? An
       eidolon follows its summoner's orders... It responded to the
       orders of a woman filled with greed this time...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;No... Mother...! I can't believe it... I was confined while
        Cleyra was destroyed...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It wasn't your fault, Dagger. They knew. That's why they
        stayed behind.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Everyone...&quot;

Ramuh: &quot;True, you were not the one who caused the destruction. But I
       must ask you... What will you do now?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;If I were more powerful... If I could use summon magic... I
        beg of you, please help me!&quot;

Ramuh: &quot;And cause more destruction?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;No... I was afraid of my summon magic, but not anymore!&quot;

[The figure of the old man changes into a brilliantly dressed man with
a large staff.]

Ramuh: &quot;...Many years have passed since I last served a master... I
       must test you to see whether you are truly fit to be my master.
       I will hide five manifestations of myself in this forest. Each
       one will carry a piece of the 'Hero's Story.' Collect all 5
       pieces and tell me the story. If you put together the story to
       my satisfaction, I shall become your eidolon.&quot;

[Ramuh disappears.]

Dagger: &quot;I'm sorry. I know we must hurry...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It's okay, Dagger.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I'll help you, too.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Thanks, you two.&quot;

[They find all five pieces and head to the exit.]

Ramuh: &quot;So you found all 5... Let's hear the story. However, the
       story comprises 4 parts. One of them doesn't belong. Be sure
       to choose only 4.&quot;
       R1 --&gt; Start
       R2 --&gt; Cancel

       R1: [See below.]
       R2: &quot;Then I shall wait...&quot;

[After picking R1:]

Ramuh: &quot;Choose the 4 pieces carefully.&quot;

[The correct order goes like so: Beginning, Cooperation, Silence, and
then one of the two endings.]

Ramuh: &quot;Let's recite your story...&quot;

[He recites it (see PR01 for options) and then asks:]

Ramuh: &quot;Are you satisfied with your choices?&quot;
       R1 --&gt; Yes
       R2 --&gt; Listen again
       R3 --&gt; Do over

       R1: [See below.]
       R2: &quot;Let's recite your story...&quot; [He recites it.]
       R3: &quot;Do you want to begin?&quot;
           R4 --&gt; Yes
           R5 --&gt; No

       R4: [You do the entire procedure over again.]
       R5: &quot;Then I shall wait...&quot;

[After picking R1:]

Ramuh: &quot;Let me ask you one thing... How come you chose 'Hero' for
       the conclusion?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;People follow a person who keeps on track. That's why I think
        a hero who acts in a straightforward manner is remembered for
        generations.&quot;

[If you picked 'Human' as the end piece:]

Ramuh: &quot;Let me ask you one thing... How come you chose 'Human' for
       the conclusion?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;People pass down stories of other people to whom they feel
        an affinity. The people in the story had flaws, as we all do.
        That is why they became heroes in the people's mind.&quot;

Ramuh: &quot;...I want to know what you think, in your own words.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Me...? I am away from my country, but I haven't forgotten
        about my people...&quot;

Ramuh: &quot;...Your soul is very tense right now. Maybe you'll begin to
       relax once I become your eidolon...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Thank you!&quot;

Ramuh: &quot;There are many paths. Remember that you alone choose the path
       on which you walk.&quot;

[Ramuh disappears and Dagger gets a Peridot.]

Dagger: (Maybe now...) &quot;Let's go to Lindblum!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Hey, old man! You're gone already?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;What's wrong?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I wanted to know why he made Dagger play such a silly game.
        Heroic? Human? Those are just things people say after the
        fact. Why try to give meaning to what the main character of
        the story chose?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...I think the old man would've become her eidolon either way.
      That's the impression I got.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane! Vivi! Let's go!&quot;

[Dagger runs away again and Ramuh's voice rings out:]

Voice: &quot;You're exactly right... It's not what the people say afterward...
       What's important is being true to oneself. She may not have realized
       it, but when she wished to learn how to use summon magic... The
       summon power returned to her. Summon magic can e used for good or
       evil. She is still young, but there is room for growth... So I chose
       her as my master. I'll be watching over her... I hope you two will
       also protect her.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Y-Yeah!&quot;
Zidane: &quot;Of course!&quot;

[The two run after Dagger.]

Dagger: &quot;Look! It's Lindblum Castle! I don't think we can turn back
        once we jump off. What do you want to do?&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Jump off now
        R2 --&gt; Jump off later

        R1: [They jump off; see below.]
        R2: [They can run back into the forest.]

[When they jump down:]

Dagger: &quot;Zidane. I want to use summon magic to protect everyone...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I know you can do it, Dagger!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Zidane! Look...!&quot;

[Zidane looks up.]

Zidane: &quot;...Is that the Red Rose!?&quot;

[FMV. The Red Rose fleet bombards Lindblum from the outside while
black mages destroy the industrial district from the inside. It's a
complete takeover.]

Zidane: &quot;Those lights must be telepods! They're sending black mages
        directly inside the castle! In Cleyra, they used summon magic
        afterwards...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;No...! Mother... Mother!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dagger!&quot;

[They all start running out of the Pinnacle Rocks, but Vivi trips and
the other two run together. FMV. Dagger and Zidane run through the
plains as a gigantic eidolon starts to suck in all the loose stuff
in Lindblum. Guards and soldiers and mages alike are swept up into its
mouth. Dagger collapses in disgust at her mother's doing. The eidolon
disappears almost as soon as its gone, and the Red Rose starts to dock
in the city... Afterwards, the party walks into the desolate Hunter's
Gate.]

===========================================================
22. Lindblum (LB02)
===========================================================

Zidane: &quot;It's so quiet...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Mother... I can't believe you attacked Lindblum!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Careful, they might still be around. Vivi, you stay here
        and hide.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;No way! It's dangerous here!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;There are Alexandrian soldiers everywhere. You should stay
        out of their sight.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...Okay.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Don't fret. We'll be right back.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I'm sorry, Vivi.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;It's okay... Just make it quick.&quot;

[The two wander through Lindblum and come to the Business District's
fountain plaza. Artania is there.]

Officer: &quot;The Industrial District is gone, and the Business and
         Theater Districts are also in ruins.&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;Allocate soldiers to the reconstruction. We must
                  get the citizens' lives back on track.&quot;

Officer: &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Uncle Artania!&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;Princess Garnet! Master Zidane! Glad to see you're
                  both safe!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Where is Uncle Cid...? Is the regent safe?&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;Yes, Princess. The castle was spared. Regent Cid
                  is alive.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Thank goodness...&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;I will take you both to see him.&quot;

[Artania leads them to Cid.]

Artania: &quot;Princess Garnet is back!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Uncle Cid!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Garnet! I thought Brahne had imprisoned you!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane rescued me.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Thank you, Zidane. &lt;Gwok!&gt;&quot;

Dagger: &quot;But Freya, Steiner, and Beatrix were left behind. I...&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Ah, the renowned General Beatrix. I don't think you have
            anything to worry about.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I don't think so either, Dagger. We wound up in Pinnacle
        Rocks instead of Treno, but... ...they'll be fine on their
        own.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;&lt;Gwok-gwok!&gt; Pinnacle...? Did you ride the gargant?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;How did you know?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;It's my job to know the land surrounding my country.
            However... I sometimes lack foresight. Brahne was after
            the &lt;gwok&gt; eidolons. That much, I knew. But I underestimated
            the power of the eidolons. Maybe I deserve to be cursed with
            this body.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I'm glad you surrendered. Cleyra resisted and perished.&quot;

Dagger: (What should I say...? What can I do...?)

Voice: &quot;Hey, we got a live one here! Watch out! It might attack!
       Hey, this one's much smaller than the others.&quot;

Voice: &quot;Ouch! Let me go! I'm not one of them!

Voice: &quot;Then why are you dressed like a black mage!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;!&quot;
Dagger: &quot;!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That must be...&quot;

[Vivi's led by two guards to the others.]

Soldier: &quot;We took an Alexandrian soldier into custody!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I just said--&quot;

Soldier: &quot;Should we turn it over to Alexandria?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Uncle Cid...&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;Let him go. Master Vivi is not an Alexandrian
                  soldier. It's only a disguise to deceive the enemy.&quot;

Soldier: &quot;I-I see! My apologies.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;......&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;I've acquired more information about Queen Brahne &lt;gwok&gt;.
            A weapons dealer named Kuja is behind the recent string of
            attacks. Kuja has been supplying Brahne with highly advanced
            magic weapons.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Supplying my mother...with weapons?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Yes. The black mage soldiers are among these weapons.
            According to eye witnesses in Treno, Kuja appeared from
            the northern sky on a silver dragon.&quot;

Zidane: (That's the guy I saw in Burmecia!)

Minister Artania: &quot;That he came from the north suggests he's from the
                  Outer Continent.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;The Outer...Continent?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;There are many unexplored continents in the world. The Outer
        Continent is an unexplored continent located to the north of
        our Mist Continent.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;I believe Kuja is the only one supplying &lt;gwok&gt; Brahne
            with weapons.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;The man I saw at the castle must have been Kuja. He must be
        the one who is corrupting my mother!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;If we defeat Kuja...!&quot;
Dagger: &quot;If we eliminate Kuja...&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;You both catch on quickly. Defeat Kuja, and Brahne loses
            her weapon supply. That will be our cue for a counterattack.&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;Challenging Brahne now will only resist in more
                  casualties.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So we crush the source of the evil!&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;Yes. Kuja will find other clients, even if we
                  defeat Brahne.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I make no excuses for my mother's behavior, but I shan't
        forgive Kuja for taking advantage of her! But first, we must
        rescue Steiner and the others...&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;I'm afraid I can't spare any soldiers. They must remain
            to protect our citizens.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, Dagger. I'm telling you, they'll be fine. The best
        dragon knight in Burmecia, the female general of Alexandria,
        and Rusty... How could they lose? Besides, you have me to
        protect you!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Then I'll look for Kuja.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I wanna go, too... There's no place for me here...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright! Let's go kick Kuja's butt! Will you lend us the
        fastest ship in Lindblum?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Airships can only fly where there is Mist, and the Mist
            only exists on this continent. &lt;Gwok.&gt; That means you
            can't cross the ocean on an airship.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What about the new airship that can fly without Mist?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;It's not ready yet &lt;gwok&gt;. Besides, it's under Brahne's
            control. Brahne gave us two conditions for our surrender.
            One was the surrender of the new airship. The other was to
            hand over &lt;gwok&gt; the Falcon Claw.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;The airship, I can understand, but what does she want with a
        piece of stone?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;I have no idea...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright. We'll take a boat.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;That's not an option, either. The harbor was also seized.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Ahhhhhh!!! What do you want us to do!? Swim!?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;There is a way. There's an old excavation site near a
            swamp located north from the castle. Monsters not native
            to our continent are rumored to appear in the excavation
            site. The cave, which was found during excavation, is
            rumored to lead to another continent.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Will this cave lead us to the Outer Continent?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Doesn't sound too reliable... Are you sure?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;&lt;Gwok&gt; I'm not sure...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I guess we'll find out. Not knowing is half of the fun, huh?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Please protect Princess Garnet. We'll prepare the
            counterattack in the meantime. It's not much, but use it
            to prepare for your journey.&quot;

[He gives the party 3000 Gil.]

Vivi: &quot;I-I'll wait here. Zidane, will you get my stuff, too?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah. That's probably a good idea.&quot;

[Zidane and Garnet go down to the business district's shop square.]

Man: &quot;Listen, Lindblum is Alexandrian territory now. You won't be able
     to come back for a while. Prepare yourself well. Let me know when
     you're ready.&quot;

[Zidane shops around and comes back.]

Man: &quot;Are you ready?&quot;
     R1 --&gt; Ready
     R2 --&gt; Need more time

     R1: &quot;Follow me. The regent is waiting on the Base Level.&quot;
     R2: &quot;Let me know when you're ready.&quot;

[An ATE 'Brahne's Fleet Arrives' plays by picking R1. After, some
soldiers are shown in the Grand Castle's fountain hallway.]

Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;I wonder where we are going next? I don't know
                     of any kingdom that poses a threat to our
                     country...&quot;

Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;I'm sure Queen Brahne has a plan. There's no
                     need for us to worry about such matters. Come now,
                     we need your help. Some Lindblum soldiers have
                     locked themselves up in the guest room.&quot;

[They walk upstairs, and Zidane walks in the room. He beckons Dagger
to the elevator and they make a run for it while they can. On the way
down:]

Zidane: &quot;I wonder what Brahne is going to do...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane... Do we really have to go to the Outer Continent...?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, what's up with you? You said you wanted to go.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What if... What if something happens to you or Vivi...? I
        might not be okay on my own.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Are you worried about me?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What? Well, I mean, um... A princess needs her elite guards,
        you know...? I'd be stranded without you guys!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Are you trying to flatter me by calling me your elite guard?
        Sorry, I was only kidding. You'll be fine with me. What about
        you, Dagger? We don't know anything about the Outer Continent.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I've made up my mind. I don't want my mother to commit any
        more atrocities.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright, then. I'll protect both you and Vivi!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Thank you...&quot;

[They finally reach the bottom. Vivi's there.]

Vivi: &quot;Zidane! I'm so glad you're here!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Vivi, where's Uncle Cid?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;U-Um... He said, 'Gwok-gwok. Wait here,' and went away
      somewhere.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Where could he be...?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;!&quot;

[Regent Cid runs down the rail track to them.]

Regent Cid: &quot;&lt;Gwok!&gt; I did it! I stopped a trolley between here and
            the Serpent's Gate! &lt;Gwok-gwok!&gt; That'll show them not to
            fool around in my castle! Now, go. &lt;Gwok-gwok.&gt; The
            excavation site is like a maze. Be careful not to get
            lost. And... Take this with you!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It's a rag.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;You big dope! It's not just a rag! &lt;Gwok!&gt; That is a
            national treasure of Lindblum! That is an ancient map of
            the entire world!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wow. Thanks!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Now, go, before they find you! Zidane, Vivi. Please
            protect Princess Garnet.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Okay.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Uncle Cid...&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;&lt;Gwok!&gt; Don't worry about me. I'm stronger than I look!
            Now, go! They'll squeeze all the oglop oil out of my body
            if we're caught!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Let's go, Dagger.&quot;

[They get on the trolley and depart, while the ATE '&lt;Gwok-gwok!&gt; How
Infuriating!' plays. Afterwards, the party sets out and heads to Qu's
Marsh.]

===========================================================
23. Qu's Marsh (QU02)
===========================================================

[Zidane finds Quina near the pond.]

Zidane: &quot;Quina! You're safe!&quot;

Quina: &quot;Long time no see, Zidane. Much trouble, coming back from
       Cleyra alone.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Do you know a way to the Outer Continent? I heard there was
        an entrance somewhere around here...&quot;

Quina: &quot;Outer Continent... Maybe I find more delicious frogs. Sound
       interesting. I help you, and I eat more frogs. I come with
       you.&quot;

[On the path to the right of Quale's house, Quina starts to run
off on her own.]

Zidane: &quot;Quina! Where are you going!?&quot;

Quina: &quot;I smell! I smell frogs!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;No, we have to look for the entrance to the Outer Continent!&quot;

Quina: &quot;I smell frogs this way!&quot;
Zidane: &quot;Hey, Quina! Hold on! Darn it...&quot;

[Quina comes out of the brush near a railing.]

Quina: &quot;A-HA! Frogs!!! Hold!&quot;

[S/he chases a frog into a cement opening, then runs back.]

Quina: &quot;They run away again...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wait a minute, Quina. Check it out. This entrance... This
        must be the entrance to the excavation site!&quot;

Quina: &quot;First time I see this. Zidane, we going inside?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Of course we will. It might lead to the Outer Continent.
        Let's go!&quot;

[They enter, coming to Fossil Roo.]

===========================================================
24. Fossil Roo (FR01)
===========================================================

[Zidane walks into the tunnel, past a suspicious door. Once he's
walked a ways, the ground shakes...]

Zidane: &quot;Wh-What the--&quot;

[...and a large creature on wheels starts chasing him.]

Zidane: &quot;You've gotta be kidding!&quot;

[The Armodulluhan chases the party through a passageway of swinging
guillotine blades, and they all stumble out the other side when the
monster falls into a pit.]

Vivi: &quot;Yikes!&quot;
Garnet: &quot;Aah!&quot;

[They both get up.]

Garnet: &quot;Sorry, Vivi. Are you okay?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Yeah... Look out!&quot;

[Zidane and Quina run into each other.]

Quina: &quot;Aiya!&quot;
Zidane: &quot;Outta my way!&quot;

[The party regroups.]

Zidane: &quot;That was a close call.&quot;

Lani: &quot;Geez... That didn't do much good.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Who's there!?&quot;

[Lani walks up the stairway into sight.]

Lani: &quot;I've been looking for you, Princess Garnet.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;H-Have we met?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;(Quit flirting with her!)&quot;
Zidane: &quot;(Yes, ma'am...)&quot;

Lani: &quot;I'm Lani. I'm under order by the queen to find you, Princess.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;My mother? What does my mother want with me? I am not
        returning to Alexandria.&quot;

Lani: &quot;I've got bad news for you, Princess. It's not you I'm after.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

Lani: &quot;The pendant. Does this sound familiar?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;!&quot;

Lani: &quot;Let's have it back. It belongs to Queen Brahne.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Lani: &quot;Listen carefully, Princess. You escaped unscathed from the
      monster, but you're not gonna be so lucky with me. Hand over
      the pendant right this minute.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Are you the one who set that monster loose?&quot;

Lani: &quot;Retrieving the pendant far outweights the safety of the
      princess.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...What do you mean by that?&quot;

Lani: &quot;I meant exactly what I said. My orders don't include Princess
      Garnet's safe return.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What...? My mother would never order that.&quot;

Lani: &quot;That's enough! Give me the pendant! You're trying my patience!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hmph. What if we refuse?&quot;

Lani: &quot;Stubborn fools! Have it your way!&quot;

[The battle starts, but they beat Lani after awhile.]

Lani: &quot;What a drag. I'll let you guys go for now!&quot;

[She runs off the way the party entered; they head the opposite way.
Zidane sees a wild gargant on an overhead track.]

Zidane: &quot;An untamed gargant, huh? Maybe I can ride it.&quot;

[Zidane picks a flower and rides it into a room down the way. After
flipping a multitude of switches, the party finds the exit.]

Zidane: &quot;This light... There's no mist here.&quot;

[He runs out and finds a large turtle-shaped town spanning across
a ravine. They enter.]

===========================================================
25. Conde Petie (CP01)
===========================================================

Vivi: &quot;We came all this way and there's still no Mist at all...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, and what a weird-shaped...village? What is that thing?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Maybe it's a temple of some kind.&quot;

Quina: &quot;Is very delicious shape. Inside might have fine cuisine!&quot;

[Quina runs into the entrance.]

Zidane: &quot;Geez... All s/he ever thinks about is food.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Well, all you ever think about is girls...&quot;

[Dagger starts walking off, too.]

Zidane: &quot;Uh, that's right! My mind is filled with thoughts of...you!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...&quot;
Zidane: &quot;...&quot;

[Vivi runs off.]

Zidane: &quot;Maybe I'm trying too hard...&quot;

[Zidane arrives at the entrance, and a goblin-like guy is there.]

Goblin?: &quot;Rally-ho!&quot;
Goblin?: &quot;Rally-ho!&quot;
Goblin?: &quot;Rally-ho!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wh-What's up with these little guys?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Wr-Wraly-ho...?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Rh-Rhallie-who...?&quot;

Goblin?: &quot;Rally-ho!&quot;
Goblin?: &quot;Rally-ho!&quot;

[Dagger and Vivi get to enter, and walk off.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, hold up...&quot;

Goblin?: &quot;Rally-ho!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh, come on...&quot;

Villager: &quot;Rally-ho's oor sacred greetin'!&quot;

Villager: &quot;If ye dinnae say Rally-Ho, then ye cannae enter Conde
          Petie, hametoon o' the dwarves!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Now, wait just a minute here...&quot;

Villager: &quot;Rally-ho!&quot;
Villager: &quot;Rally-ho!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;... ...Rally-ho...&quot;

Dwarf: &quot;Rally-ho! Ye can pass!&quot;
Villager: &quot;Rally-ho!&quot;

[Zidane walks around and talks to Vivi in the upper shrine (CP05) and
then watches the ATE 'Hungry Bryan' to cue the events up. He heads
down into the grocery and sees a Black Mage there.]

Zidane: &quot;Hm?&quot;

Wendy Grocer: &quot;Plenty thanks. Yir goods are always welcome here.&quot;

Black Mage: &quot;...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey...&quot;

Black Mage: &quot;!!!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;What the--&quot;

Black Mage: &quot;...&quot;

[The black mage runs off.]

Vivi: &quot;W-Wait!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hang on, Vivi!&quot;

[They chase the mage to the exit.]

Vivi: &quot;Come back!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Vivi!&quot;

[Dagger runs over.]

Dagger: &quot;Zidane, what's going on?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I have no idea... But we gotta catch up with Vivi!&quot;

[They find Vivi at the exit.]

Zidane: &quot;Vivi, where's the black mage?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;He ran away.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Huh. Where the heck did he come from? Has Brahne found us?&quot;

Harold Pathknower: &quot;Do ye ken the Pyntie-Hats?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Huh? Did you just say Pointy-Hats!?&quot;

Harold Pathknower: &quot;Nay, Ah said Pyntie-Hats! They often come from
                   the Soothern Forest tae trade wi' us.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;They!? You mean there's lots of them? And...they live near here?&quot;

Harold Pathknower: &quot;Aye! But ye gots tae go all the way aroon' yon cliff
                   an' then go east tae find the Sootheast Forest! They
                   live sae deep in the forest, that even owls dinnae
                   live there!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What's that supposed to mean?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Zidane, I want to go to the Southeast Forest and find them!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, me too.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I think it's a good idea. We might find some clues.&quot;

Quina: &quot;If possible to try new food, anywhere fine.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright, let's head to the Southeast Forest.&quot;

[The party runs to the forest in question and enters the deepest part.]

===========================================================
26. Black Mage Village (BM01)
===========================================================

[The party follows the mage in but loses sight of him.]

Zidane: &quot;I think they live 'so deep in the forest tha owls don't
        even live there.'&quot;

[Using a sign as their guide, they follow the mage into the village
which was hidden behind an illusion of dead trees. The party runs to
the entrance.]

Black Mage: &quot;!&quot;

Black Mage: &quot;Ahh! H-H-Humans...&quot;

Black Mage: &quot;? What's wrong?&quot;

[He turns around.]

Black Mage: &quot;!&quot;

Black Mage: &quot;HUmans! Run!!!&quot;

[They scatter like the wind.]

Vivi: &quot;W-Wait... Did you see them!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Y-Yeah...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;They were talking! There ARE others like me!&quot;

[Vivi runs off.]

Dagger: &quot;Why would anyone build a village in the middle of a dying
        forest...?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Beats me...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Where's Vivi?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;He went that way...but I... Hey!&quot;

[Dagger runs off on her own, too.]

Quina: &quot;A village! Village always have good food. I go find!&quot;

[Quina bolts.]

Zidane: &quot;Geez, you people...&quot;

[Zidane heads towards the cemetery to the left of the synth shop, and
the ATE 'Different Language' plays (if not viewed). Afterwards, Vivi
flees past him.]

Zidane: &quot;! Hey, Vivi! What's up with him...?&quot;

[Zidane finds him in the inn.]

Zidane: &quot;...Vivi? What's wrong?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Huh? Oh, Zidane... It's... It's nothing.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Did something bad happen? All the black mages seem pretty nice.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Nothing happened...&quot;

[Quina enters the inn.]

Quina: &quot;Grr... I hungry! This village people eat terrible food.&quot;

[Dagger enters.]

Dagger: &quot;Oh, Vivi. You're back. Where were you? You look very...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You got tired, right, Vivi?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Y-Yeah...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I don't blame you. We've been walking around non-stop. We
        should call it a day.&quot;

Quina: &quot;I go to forest and look for food.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What about you, Zidane?&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Rest
        R2 --&gt; Not yet

        R1 (Zidane): &quot;Yeah, we'll call it a day.&quot;
        R2 (Zidane): &quot;I'm not tired yet.&quot;

[After choosing to rest, the party lazes around 'til nightfall. Vivi
talks with a mage, then walks out on his own; Garnet sees him.]

Dagger: &quot;Zidane... Vivi just walked out.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Maybe he's letting us have a little romantic quiet time.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I'm serious!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...I wouldn't worry too much.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;But...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;He's trying to figure something out for himself.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

[Zidane and Dagger's following words show up as Vivi walks alone in
the still of the night.]

Zidane: &quot;Think about it... Vivi's never met black mages like himself
        before.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;But what if they're being mean to him, or saying nasty things?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Do you really think the people of this village gathered to
        do something like that?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Maybe... Just maybe, he'll find what he's looking for.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;...Find what?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;A place to call home.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Home?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah... A place where he belongs...&quot;

[The screen shows Zidane and Dagger lying on some bunk beds.]

Dagger: &quot;Hey, Zidane... When you said home...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What's the matter? Can't fall asleep? How about a bedtime
        story? Let's see... Once upon a time...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;There you go again, teasing me...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Once upon a time... ...there was a man. There was a man who
        didn't know where he came from...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;...Zidane?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;This man had longed to find his birthplace ever since he was
        a small child. His birthplace. A place he only remembered in
        his dreams...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Why...?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;He wanted to know more about himself, maybe. About his place,
        the house where he was born... One day, the man left the home
        of his adoptive father and went on a quest to find the answer.
        His only clue was the blue light he saw in his dreams...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;A blue light?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah. He thought it might be a memory of his birthplace. An
        ocean, maybe...?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Did he find it?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, you're jumping ahead. A lot of things happened along the
        way. Alright, we can skip ahead... No, he never found it. How
        could he? His only clue was a colored light. So he went back
        to the home of his adoptive father... What do you think his
        father did when he came home?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;...Welcomed him home?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;No way! The father raised his fist and beat the son he had
        worked so hard to raise...&quot; &lt;Wham!&gt; &lt;Pow!&gt; &lt;Whack!&gt; &lt;Bam!&gt;

Dagger: &quot;Why?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I don't know... But you know what surprised him even more?
        The father smiled, after beating up his son! Can you believe
        that? He just gave his son a beating. But this is what the man
        thought when he saw his father smile... This is my home. This
        is the place I call home. The man is still searching for his
        birthplace. But he already has a home. Maybe... ...it's the
        same for Vivi. He's looking for a place to call home.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I wonder if Vivi will stay in the village?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Who knows... That's for him to decide.&quot;

[At the cemetery, Vivi finds Mr. 288.]
</pre><pre id="faqspan-7">
Black Mage No. 288: &quot;Hello. Nice to see you again.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Um... I wanted to ask you something.&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;What is it?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I was wondering how many people have...stopped...moving.&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;You're very kind to use our words. But you already
                    know what it means to live...and to die. You're
                    asking about our friends who have 'died,' not
                    'stopped.'&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Um...&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;Several of our friends stopped functioning
                    recently... I think our life span is limited...
                    I've suspected this ever since the first one came
                    to a stop. It varies a little, but most of us stop
                    moving one year after production.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;No...&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;I haven't told anyone else about this. If I did,
                    they'd feel the same way I do.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;What do you feel?&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;I don't know... Fear? I don't want to stop. And
                    maybe I want to run away from it all. But living
                    in the village with everyone fills me with joy.
                    The joy of living with them far outweighs the fear
                    of death. Isn't it the same with you? Traveling
                    with your friends gives your life meaning.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I...&quot;

[The next morning, Zidane walks to the town gates and finds Dagger
conversing with a mage.]

Dagger: &quot;Really?&quot;

Black Mage No. 144: &quot;Yeah, I think that's what you're looking for.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Thank you!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What's up, Dagger?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane! Someone saw a silver dragon in the northwest part of
        this continent. The people of Conde Petie said there was a
        place called Sanctuary, where entrance is restricted...&quot;

Black Mage No. 144: &quot;I think this 'Kuja' said something about a secret
                    being hidden on this continent.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You heard him say that?&quot;

Black Mage No. 144: &quot;Yeah. Something about the source of the Mist...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Maybe we can find our more if we go there. And maybe save my
        mother...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Right...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Oh, where's Vivi? If Vivi's says he's staying behind...&quot;

[Vivi runs to everyone.]

Vivi: &quot;Wait for me!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Vivi?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Everyone in the village asked me to see the outside world and
      tell them all about it.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I see...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh, man! I thought Dagger and I'd get to spend some quality
        time together.&quot;

Quina: &quot;What you say?&quot;

[Quina runs into town.]

Quina: &quot;You no can leave me here. I starve.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh yeah, I forgot about you...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Let's go, everyone! To Conde Petie! And to the Sanctuary,
        that lies beyond!&quot;

[The party rolls back to Conde Petie.]

===========================================================
27. Conde Petie (CP02)
===========================================================

[The party stops before the entrance.]

Zidane: &quot;So the Sanctuary is on the other side of that valley...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;But the exit leading there from the upper floor is guarded by
      a dwarf who won't let us through.&quot;

Quina: &quot;Twin dwarfes block way out from shop on right side. No can
       get through.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hmm... Well, let's just try to go as far as we can.&quot;

[The party tries to leave town and gets stiff-armed by Shanis or the
two watchmen by the shop. They tell Zidane to seek out 'His Holiness';
they find the person in question in a corridor.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, mister... Are you the holy guy?&quot;

David Heavenguard: &quot;Aye. Ah'm Father David.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What are you doing, hanging around this hallway?&quot;

David Heavenguard: &quot;Well...a priest has much tae worry aboot, ye see?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah...whatever. Look, we wanna get past this village.&quot;

David Heavenguard: &quot;Hmph! Tradition states that only those who undergo
                   the ceremony kin approach the Sanctuary.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So, what the heck is that ceremony about, anyway?&quot;

[Dagger walks into the hallway.]

David Heavenguard: &quot;Well, after a man an' a woman are blessed in holy
                   union, they leave oan holy pilgrimage tae the
                   Sanctuary.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So...basically it's a wedding...and a honeymoon, right?&quot;

David Heavenguard: &quot;Ah dinnae ken yir words, lad, but methinks ye
                   understan'.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;So we can go to the Sanctuary if we undergo that ceremony,
        right?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh, hey, Dagger! So yeah, that's the deal. Whaddya think?
        We can go if we get hitched. But there's no way we'd
        actually--&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Let's do it.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What!?&quot;

David Heavenguard: &quot;Sae ye wantae be joined, eh? The ceremony's only
                   fer dwarves, see... ...But we have sae few young
                   folk nowadays. We're doon tae ninety-nine couples.
                   Ah was worryin' aboot that very thin'... But where's
                   the harm? Now we can have oor hundredth ceremony!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;... Uhh... Dagger? Wh-What's going on?&quot;

[Later on, Dagger and Zidane stand on the Kirkboat and face the altar
where David Heavenguard stands preaching.]

David Heavenguard: &quot;Speerits o' the moontain, Speerits o' the wood...&quot;

Zidane: (Uh... Now, how did I get into this?)

David Heavenguard: &quot;Watch ower this man an' woman as they begin their
                   journey...&quot;

Zidane: (We gotta do this ceremony to get past this village... And
        only a guy and girl can have the ceremony...)

[Flashback to a few moments before the ceremony:]

Zidane: &quot;Now hold on a sec, Dagger! Don't you get it? This is marriage,
        m-a-r-r-a-i-g-e!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;No kidding... But we have to do it to go on, right?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, but... But that's not reason enough!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Oh, come on.&quot;

[Flashback: end.]

Zidane: (What is she thinking? She's supposed to get angry and say no way!)

David Heavenguard: &quot;...In sickness an' in health...&quot;

Zidane: (Of course we're just trying to get past this village...)

David Heavenguard: &quot;...Have the strength to carry ye through the trials...&quot;

Zidane: (Could it be that she...likes me?)

David Heavenguard: &quot;...An' the wisdom tae follow the path...&quot;

Zidane: (Gotta admit, I was pretty deep that night in the black mage
        village. Maybe that's when she fell for me? I'm such a stud!)

David Heavenguard: &quot;May the blessin's o' heaven be upon this man an'
                   woman!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dagger! Now we're man and wife! Time for the kiss...&quot;

[Zidane lunges and misses as Dagger walks away.]

Zidane: &quot;Playing hard to get, eh?&quot;

[Afterwards, near the gatekeeper's station:]

Shanis Gatekeeper: &quot;Happy fit! Now ye need anoonce yer joinin' tae
                   the twins at the other gate!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What!? You mean there's more?&quot;

Shanis Gatekeeper: &quot;We have tae follow tradition, lad!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Ah, well... Time for us newlyweds to make the rounds, Dagger.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Remember, we're only married while we're here.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Bliss is so fleeting.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Zidane... What are we supposed to do?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey! You guys tryin' to ruin our honeymoon?&quot;

Quina: &quot;But you no can just leave us here!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Don't worry. I'll figure something out. Hmm, let's see...&quot;
        R1 --&gt; First, let's go see the twins
        R2 --&gt; Why don't you guys get married, too?

        R1: &quot;I think we should all go see the twins first.&quot;

            {They go to see the watchmen; see below.]

        R2: &quot;Why don't you guys get married, too?&quot;

            Vivi: &quot;What!?&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;Yeah, that's it! In the meantime, Dagger and I
                    can go announce our marriage.&quot;

            Vivi: &quot;...&quot;
            Quina: &quot;...&quot;

            [The ATE 'Nuptial Joy' is automatically cued.]

[The party goes to see the watchmen regardless of the option.]

Zidane: &quot;Hi, guys! We're the newlyweds, Zidane and Dagger.&quot;

Richard Watchman: &quot;Rally-ho! Happy fit! Off tae the Sanctuary then,
                  are ye?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;That's right. Will you let us through now?&quot;

Matthew Watchman: &quot;Rally-ho! O' coorse! Safe journey tae both o' ye!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Let us be off, my darling!&quot;

Voice: &quot;Thief!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Huh?

[A little girl with purple hair runs by.]

Girl: &quot;Mog, hurry!&quot;

Mog: &quot;Kupo!&quot;

[They run off.]

Watchman: &quot;Stop, thief!&quot;

Watchman: &quot;Stop, thief!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Wh-What's going on?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I dunno. Let's go take a look.&quot;

[They find the watchmen near the town's edge.]

Richard Watchman: &quot;They got away...&quot;

Matthew Watchman: &quot;Feuch! An' we cannae go any farther...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Does anyone live out here?&quot;

Richard Watchman: &quot;O' course no! It's forbidden!&quot;

Matthew Watchman: &quot;Och! Yon two thieves are always snitchin' food!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh yeah?&quot;

Richard Watchman: &quot;Weel, Ah'd best go report the theft.

[The watchmen leave; Vivi and Quina walk over.]

Dagger: &quot;Oh, hi, guys...&quot;

[If Vivi/Quina didn't have a wedding, the scene'll be:]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, you guys snuck through during the commotion?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Y-Yeah...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I guess we didn't have to go through with that ceremony,
        after all.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What!? But it's the stuff memories are made out of!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;And we'll forget it all once we leave. Come, it's time to
        press on.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yes, dearest...&quot;

[If they did get married, the scene'll be:]

Zidane: &quot;So you've had your ceremony, right?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Y-Yeah...&quot;

Quina: &quot;They have nerve to steal food right in front of me.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Okay, time to press on.&quot;

===========================================================
28. Conde Petie Mountain Path (CM01)
===========================================================

[The party walks onto the mountain path and stops soon.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey...&quot;

[The little girl from before is suspended in the air, her shirt
caught on a branch.]

Mog: &quot;Kupopo!!!&quot;

Little Girl: &quot;Hurry, Mog! Before we get caught!&quot;

Mog: &quot;Kupo.&quot;

Little Girl: &quot;What's wrong, Mog?&quot;

Mog: &quot;K-Kupo!!!&quot;

[Mog flies off.]

Little Girl: &quot;W-Wait!!! Don't leave me here!!! Sigh... Stuck on a
             branch... Betrayed by my own trusted moogle... Is this
             how I meet my end? Mog... I'm gonna haunt you if I die
             here! Oh, am I hallucinating? That person has no horn.
             He has a tail, though. Huh!? AHHH!!! Help!!! Don't eat
             me! I won't taste good! It's true! I taste awful!!!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You heard her, Quina.&quot;

Quina: &quot;I see. Too bad. But moogle that ran away a very strange color.
       I go find and eat it.&quot;

Little Girl: &quot;No, don't!&quot;

[Quina jumps over the little girl and knocks her loose.]

Little Girl: &quot;Ahhh!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Gotcha...!&quot;

[Quina runs off.]

Little Girl: &quot;...... Th-Thanks...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Are you okay?&quot;

Little Girl: &quot;Yeah...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;You're not hurt?&quot;

Little Girl: &quot;I told you I'm okay! I'm not a child, like that kid in blue!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;But... You don't look any older than me.&quot;

Little Girl: &quot;Are you kidding!? And I do have a name, you know!&quot;

[Default: Eiko]

Eiko: &quot;The name's Eiko! Shouldn't you introduce yourself before
      addressing a lady?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;You introduced yourself first...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;You got a problem!?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;......&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I'm Dagger, and this is Vivi.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Yeah? What about you?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Me? I'm Zidane.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Zidane. Alright.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So, Miss Eiko, why did you steal from the village?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;I was hungry...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Ha ha ha... You sound just like Quina. Hey, did s/he really
        go chasing after that moogle?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Oh no... S/he's gonna eat Mog!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I don't think Quina would eat a moogle. Do you live nearby, Eiko?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Yeah, beyond this path. I'm sure Mog went home...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Why don't we take her home?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yes, yes... Anything for my lovely wife.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;You two are married!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yep, we're newlyweds.&quot;
Dagger: &quot;No, no. We're just friends.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Well, I guess that's better than nothing...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;I wanna be your friend, too!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright, then, let's go to our new friend's house.&quot;

[The party starts walking and Zidane stops when he sees a gigantic
tree in the distance, roots stretching everywhere.]

Zidane: &quot;What's that...?&quot;

[FMV. Zoomed-in picture of the tree.]

Zidane: &quot;Is that the Sanctuary?&quot;

[In the next screen, the ground shakes.]

Zidane: &quot;What the...!?&quot;

[The party engages the giant Hilgilgars in battle and gives it a
giant beating.]

Eiko: &quot;That big monster just shows up from time to time. I usually
      just run away.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;But you're a pretty good fighter, Eiko.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Tee-hee. Thanks. Hey, that's not the way to my house! That's
      the way to the Iifa Tree! This way to my place!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I was only looking at the mountains...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;The Iifa Tree? I thought it was called Sanctuary.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Huh? Oh, that's what the dwarves call it. Everyone else
      calls it the Iifa Tree.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;The Iifa Tree...?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Let's go!&quot;

[The party goes to the world map and heads to the ruins on the beach
of the peninsula.]

===========================================================
29. Madain Sari, Village of the Lost Summoners (MS01)
===========================================================

[They walk into the broken-down town.]

Eiko: &quot;Zidane! This is my home: Madain Sari, the village of summoners!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;The village of the summoners...? You live here...?&quot; (It's
        a pile of rubble.) &quot;Dagger?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What happened here...? This place is in ruins.

[Three moogles appear, all saying their &quot;Kupo!&quot;s.]

Eiko: &quot;Mocha! Moco! Chimomo!&quot;

[Two more poke up in some junk.]

Eiko: &quot;Momatose! Morrison! Where's Mog? No... Mog got eaten!? MOG!&quot;

[The little mog peeks out and flies over to Eiko.]

Mog: &quot;Kup! Kupo... Kupo?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;No, I'm not mad. But don't ever leave me behind again, okay?&quot;

Mog: &quot;Kupo! Kupo!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Good! Zidane! Follow me!&quot;

[The cloud of moogles hails Eiko into town, and the rest follow. At
the square (or what's left of it), Eiko talks to her fluffy friends.]

Eiko: &quot;Get to work, you guys!&quot;

Moogle: &quot;Kupo! Yes, ma'am.

Eiko: &quot;Mog, you stay here with me.&quot;

Mog: &quot;Kupo!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Okay, come on!

Mog: &quot;Kupo!&quot;

[Mog jumps inside Eiko's clothing.]

Zidane: &quot;Did that moogle just go inside your dress?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Yup! Mog always stays with me.&quot;

[Mog jumps out again.]

Mog: &quot;Kupo!&quot;

[...then jumps right back in.]

Eiko: &quot;Zidane, come sit over here!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;H-Hey!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Tell me more about yourself! Tell me!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Sure. I wanna know more about you, too, Eiko.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Really!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;For instance, this eidolon...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Where are you from? How old are you? What do you do? Where
      are you going?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;No, what I wanna know is...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;What kind of foods do you like? What kind of eidolons do you
      like? What type of moogles do you like? What type of girls do
      you like?

[The party converses for awhile.]

Eiko: &quot;I never met anyone like you before...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dagger? What's wrong? You look dazed.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Oh, it's nothing.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Do you have a fever?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Ahhh!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You're fine. Hey, are you jealous?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Why would I be jealous?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Are you and Dagger really just friends? Seems like...you guys
      are...something more.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Well... Yeah, we're more than friends.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;So? What are you guys?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We're a team.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;A team...?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah. Vivi's also part of the team. Hey... Where did he go?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Is it sort of like me and the moogles?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Something like that.&quot;

[A moogle runs over.]

Mocha: &quot;All clean! Kupo!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Thanks, Mocha! I'll be right there! I'm gonna start cooking!
      You have to come and eat at my place later, okay?&quot;

[She runs off.]

Zidane: &quot;There's still stuff I want to ask her. Let's accept her
        invitation.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Okay...&quot;

[Eiko runs back over.]

Eiko: &quot;I'll call you when the food's ready. Don't go to far!&quot;

[She runs off again. Zidane finds Vivi near the seaside balcony.]

Zidane: &quot;...Vivi? What's up? Is something wrong?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Oh, it's nothing. I was just thinking...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Well, ry not to think too much. Get some rest.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Okay. Thanks, Zidane.&quot;

[Vivi talks to Morrison by the kitchen entrance.]

Morrison: &quot;Thank you for waiting. Lady Eiko says the food will be
          ready soon. I'll take you to the Eidolon Wall in the
          meantime. Please follow me.&quot;

[He follows Morrison to the Eidolon Wall.]

Moco: &quot;!&quot;

[Moco flies away when Morrison talks to him.]

Morrison: &quot;Moco was very proud of his role as the Eidolon Wall guard.
          Eiko's decision to show the Eidolon Wall to outsiders upset
          him. But we moogles love Eiko. He'll understand, in time.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Why does the wall need protection?&quot;

Morrison: &quot;The Eidolon Wall has been protected by Eiko's summoner
          tribe for generations.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Summoner tribe? I'm gonna go get Dagger. She can use
        summon magic.&quot;

Morrison: &quot;Is that true?&quot;

[Zidane finds Dagger by the town entrance.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, Dagger. Come with me. I'll show you something big!
        Summon-magic stuff.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Summon magic?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, it's called the Eidolon Wall!&quot;

[They both go back to the Wall.]

Morrison: &quot;Please come in. The Eidolon Wall is this way.&quot;

[The three go inside. The Wall is actually a circular structure with
a large incense pile burning in the middle. Paintins are everywhere.]

Morrison: &quot;The Eidolon Wall is a collection of paintings. The summoner
          tribe painted all their eidolons they found during their
          research.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;These eidolons all exist?&quot;

Morrison: &quot;Kupo. This is a holy place for the summoner tribe. Lady
          Eiko comes here everyday to pray and burn incense for her
          ancestors.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What's this one...? There's Atomos. That's Bahamut.&quot;

[Dagger stoops down.]

Zidane: &quot;What's wrong, Dagger?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You'll get it back.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;...... I want to look at the murals some more.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Okay.&quot;

[Zidane goes back to the kitchen.]

Mog: &quot;Kupopo!

[The feast is set on the table. Zidane says one of these lines,
which are rather indictative of your meal's worth.]

Zidane: &quot;Wow, this looks great!&quot;
Zidane: &quot;Ah, so you finished.&quot;

Mog: &quot;Kupopopo!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Welcome, Zidane! Have a seat.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You made a lot!&quot;
Zidane: &quot;This food's gonna be gone so fast!&quot;

[If Eiko had Quina's help, she'll say:]

Eiko: &quot;What's his name? Quina? S/he helped me.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;S/he helped you without eating all the food? Amazing.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Vivi, too!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Hehehe.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Let's eat!&quot;

[If she had no help from Quina, she'll say:]

Eiko: &quot;I cooked it all for you, Zidane!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Let's eat!&quot;


[Everyone starts eating.]

Eiko: &quot;How is it?&quot;

[Zidane will say one of these lines:]

Zidane: &quot;Wow, this stew tastes amazing! You should start a restaurant.
        The fish is just right. Hey, Eiko, where are all the other
        summoners? Are they hiding underground or something?&quot;
Zidane: &quot;The stew tastes...interesting. The fish tastes better than
        it looks, but it doesn't have much meat on it. Hey, Eiko,
        where are all the other summoners? Are they hiding underground
        or something?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Underground? Yeah. They're all underground, sleeping the
      eternal sleep.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What...?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;I'm the last survivor of my tribe. I've been living with
      moogles ever since my grandpa died last year.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I'm sorry...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Oh, don't worry about me. I'm really happy here.&quot;

Moogle: &quot;Kupo!&quot;
Moogle: &quot;Kupo!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Ten years ago, which is four years before I was born... A
      natural disaster struck the village. Even the survivors
      suffered a great deal. But my mom and dad fell in love and had
      a family. Not that I remember what they look like, because they
      died when I was very young.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I see...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;I'm like a beautiful young heroine in turmoil, don't you think?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Huh?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;You know why I'm here in this village? It was to meet you,
      Zidane, my beautiful shooting star...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;That's a line from Lord Avon's play 'Wishing Upon A Star.'&quot;

Eiko: &quot;How did you know!? Darn it!&quot;

Zidane: (How does Eiko know about that play? This place is far from
        the Mist Continent.)

[Vivi can interrupt Eiko starting at her shooting star line (and
consequently skipping the above dialogue) if she added an oglop
into the stew. Like so:]

Vivi: &quot;Whoa!!! Ahhh!!!&quot;
Eiko: &quot;What is it? interrupt me!&quot;
Vivi: &quot;There's something in here with feelers...&quot;
Zidane: &quot;...An oglop?&quot;
Eiko: &quot;Don't you know that oglops are a Conde Petie delicacy?&quot;
Moogle: &quot;Kupo!&quot;
Vivi: &quot;......&quot;
Dagger: &quot;......&quot;
Zidane: &quot;L-Let's eat the fish. That should be okay.&quot;

[They finish their meal.]

Dagger: &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Thanks, Eiko!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That was really good!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;See? Don't you wanna eat my food everyday?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Maybe. Hey, there's some other stuff I wanna ask you.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Maybe!? That's soooo rude of you!!! Zidane, help me clear the
      table! Bring the pot over to the kitchen!&quot;

[Zidane gets the pot; meanwhile, Eiko is thinking to herself.]

Eiko: &quot;So it wasn't just Dagger... Zidane is really slow, too! Those
      two are going nowhere fast. Well, this is good news for me!&quot;

[Zidane comes in.]

Zidane: &quot;Is there something on my face?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Thanks, Zidane. Could you leave it there?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, Eiko, do you know anything about the Iifa Tree?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;What about the Iifa Tree?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We want to go there.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;It's sealed with an eidolon. You can't get in.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Sealed? Did you seal it, Eiko?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Well...&quot; (So he's sharp about certain things.) &quot;It all happened
      before I was born, but they sealed an eidolon that we failed to
      summon in the Iifa Tree. It's our custom to seal a failed
      eidolon where we summon it.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;An eidolon you failed to summon...?&quot;

[Zidane tries to leave the dining room, but Momatose barges in.]

Momatose: &quot;You should get some sleep before you go!&quot; {Sleep/Don't Sleep}

[In the middle of the night, Zidane finds Vivi by the balcony.]

Zidane: &quot;Vivi... You better get some sleep before we leave tomorrow.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I tried to stop worrying about things, but I just can't. I
      know you told me not to think too much, but...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That's because we're different, Vivi. You don't have to do
        everything my way, you know?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I want to stop... I don't wanna feel like this anymore. What
      if I keep feeling like this?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Vivi... Well...in the end, it boils down to two simple
        choices. Either you do or you don't. You'd think with all the
        problems in this world, there'd be more answers. It's not
        fair... ...but that's the way things are. The choice is yours.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Zidane...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I just wanna protect the people I'm with. Doesn't matter if I
        can or not. It's what I believe in.&quot;

[Eiko is sitting on the kitchen steps and can hear them, but not see
them on the other side of the building.]

Eiko: &quot;I knew it! I was right! Zidane is the man for me! He's right.
      Either you do, or you don't. My choice is clear! I wanna go with
      Zidane!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You wanna know a trick to get your mid off things?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Okay.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;This is an age-old ritual between male friends!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Uh-huh.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Come over here, Vivi. Let's go together. Doesn't it feel
        nice to let yourself go under the stars?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;......&quot;

Noise: &lt;Tinkle.&gt; &lt;Tinkle tinkle.&gt; &lt;Tinkle tinkle tinkle tinkle.&gt;
       &lt;Tinkle tinkle.&gt;

[Eiko runs inside. The next morning, the party gathers at the city
entrance, ready for departure.]

Dagger: &quot;Zidane, I want to come back here. When I first saw the
        Eidolon Wall, I was scared... But when I went inside and saw
        the murals, they calmed me. I want to see more.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Sure. We'll come back after we check out the Iifa Tree.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Thank you...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We gotta come back and get Quina, anyway. We can't just
        leave him here.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Are you coming back here for Eiko?&quot;

[A glob of purple hair listens to the conversation at this point.]

Zidane: &quot;Eiko is only six years old. She acts tough, but I think she's
        lonely.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I haven't seen her today.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You're right.&quot;

[Two moogles appear.]

Moogle: &quot;Kupo!&quot;
Moogle: &quot;Kupo!&quot;

[Two more poke up right by Eiko, giving her position away.]

Moogle: &quot;Kupo!&quot;
Moogle: &quot;Kupo!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Eiko!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Tee hee. You can't break the seal of the Iifa Tree without
      calling an eidolon.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You're coming with us?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Don't you want me to?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Of course I want you to come along!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;That's what I thought. Okay, I'll join your team for a while!
      Vivi, Dagger, let's have fun! The Iifa Tree is beyond the Conde
      Petie Mountain Path! Let's go!&quot;

[Eiko runs out of town, jumping over Vivi and knocking him over.]

Dagger: &quot;Why are you so nice to everyone, Zidane?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Huh? What do you mean by that?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Forget I asked...

[She leaves.]

Vivi: &quot;I think she was mad...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You think so, too?&quot;

[Morrison flitters down.]

Morrison: &quot;Please look after Lady Eiko. Come see us if there is any
          trouble.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Sure thing! Vivi, have you figured out a solution to your
        problem?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Not really. But I'm moving on.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Good!&quot;

===========================================================
30. Iifa, the Ancient Tree of Life (IT01)
===========================================================

[The party walks to a promontory near the tree roots.]

Dagger: &quot;There's Mist here...!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So this place really must be the source of the Mist.&quot;

[Vivi trips.]

Eiko: &quot;You okay?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...I-I'm fine.&quot;

[Zidane is repelled by a barrier as he advances.]

Zidane: &quot;Whoa! What was that?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;That was the seal. It shouldn't hurt you, but are you alright?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, it didn't hurt. Hmm...&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Poke again
        R2 --&gt; Body slam
        R3 --&gt; Ask Eiko

        R1: [Zidane pokes it.]
        R2: [Zidane kicks recklessly.] &quot;Graaagh!&quot;

            [He's repelled still (of course).]

            Zidane: &quot;Only you can break the seal? No wonder the
                    dwarves of Conde Petie call this place a
                    Sanctuary.&quot;

            [R3 segways after this.]

        R3: &quot;Did you say they used the power of an eidolon to seal
            this place? Amazing. How do you break it?&quot;

            Eiko: &quot;I'm going to ask the eidolon to come back. The
                  summoner's horn allows us to communicate with
                  eidolons and wild animals. I'll break the seal now.
                  Watch! Boom boom boom! Boom boom boom! By the light
                  of our spirits! I call upon thee! Answer my call!
                  Wherever your soul may be!&quot;

[The seal crackles in a few places and disappears. A Ruby remains.]

Eiko: &quot;Finished! We can go inside now.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Thanks!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Was that the spell to break the seal?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Nope. All I do is focus my thoughts into my horn.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Then why were you...?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;That was just for show! The spell is actually much longer, but
      the eidolon asked me to hurry it up.&quot;

Dagger: (I didn't hear anything...)

Zidane: &quot;Alright. Let's go!&quot;

[The party runs over the roots 'til they find a weird platform with
a circular indentation in the middle.]

Zidane: &quot;What's this...? Looks old. I wonder who built it?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;This way! Hey, are you alright?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;A-Aren't you guys scared of heights...?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Gosh, you look so helpless. Why don't you stay here and let
      us handle the rest?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;No, I'm going with you guys! I have to.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Then don't leave my side, okay?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;O-Okay. Thanks.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Eiko, do you know anything about this place?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Nope. This is my first time inside the Iifa Tree.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;This place looks ancient...&quot;

[Zidane taps on the indentation part, making it glow.]

Eiko: &quot;!&quot;
Vivi: &quot;!&quot;
Dagger: &quot;!&quot;
Zidane: &quot;!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What the...&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Touch it again
        R2 --&gt; Try standing on it
        R3 --&gt; Ask Eiko

        R1: [He touches it again and it glows for a moment.]

        R2: &quot;Alright, then!&quot;

            Dagger: &quot;Zidane...&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;I'll be fine. Don't worry!&quot;

        R3: &quot;What do you think, Eiko?&quot;

            Eiko: &quot;Maybe...try standing on it?&quot;

            [Option R2 plays, then.]

[Zidane gets on the indentation and it starts to move down; he makes
sure to jump back up before he leaves everyone behind.]

Zidane: &quot;......&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Here it comes again. It works. I'm gonna see where it takes
        me. I'll call you guys over if everything is alright.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;I'm coming with you!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Me, too.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;M-Me, too.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Okay, we'll all go.

[Everyone hops on the elevator and heads down, eventually coming to
a large pillar with briars wrapped around it. An unearthly green glow
comes from all over.]

Zidane: &quot;Everything up there looks withered. This place looks totally
        different. It's so bright I can't see the bottom... I guess we
        should try to get to the bottom of this!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Hey, Zidane. I found something here.&quot;

[She looks at a large leaf-shaped object connected to the pillar.]

Zidane: &quot;Hmm... Maybe it'll move like the last one...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;It didn't move when I got on...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You got on it!? Well...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Why don't we all try getting on?&quot;

[They all get on the 'leaf' and it glows.]

Zidane: &quot;When I got on, I felt it respond. I guess we're in luck!&quot;

[The leaf starts to head down the pillar, encircling it. There's no
backdraft or breeze knocking anyone around, though.]

Zidane: &quot;Whoa... It sure freaked me out at first, but there's no
        wind or anything... I guess that glowing powder is stopping
        the wind somehow. You okay, Dagger?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yes... I wonder where we're going?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah...me, too.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Maybe Mog can tell us something!&quot;

[Eiko lets Mog out.]

Eiko: &quot;What do you feel, here inside the Iifa Tree?&quot;

Mog: &quot;Kupo... ...Kupo? KUPO! POPO!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Really?&quot;

Mog: &quot;Kupo!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Alright... Thanks!&quot;

Mog: &quot;Kupopo!&quot;

[Mog goes back inside the dress.]

Zidane: &quot;Well? What's the word?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Um, Mog senses a lot of life beneath us. Moogles are faeries,
      so they sense life everywhere, but Mog says there's a whole lot
      here!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I wonder if agents of Kuja are down there...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;But what's the connection between Kuja and the Mist?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;!? Incoming!&quot;

[The party defeats some zombies that had attacked.]

Eiko: &quot;There are so many strange monsters here in the Iifa Tree!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Could the Mist be causing it?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Beats me... The Evil Forest and Gargan Roo had unique
        monsters, too.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;But if the Mist comes from this tree, how come it only appears
      on Zidane's continent?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I guess there has to be something that channels the Mist.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yes, but the question is, why?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;......&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hmm? What's the matter? ...Vivi? What's wrong, Vivi? You've
        been lost in thought for a while.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Oh, Zidane... I've been thinking about the Mist. Do you
      remember the...factory we saw in Dali?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yes, the factory where black mages were being made?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Huh? Black mages?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;They look a lot like Vivi.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dagger!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;It's okay. I'm not upset anymore...about being made and everything.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Vivi...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Anyway, that factory had a lot of Mist inside, right?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh, yeah... There was a huge machine filled with Mist.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;That's right. And there were those strange eggs we saw.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;There's gotta be a connection between the Mist, Kuja, and...
      the black mages.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Eiko: &quot;I'm so confused. !? Another one's headed this way!&quot;

[The party fends off a Dracozombie.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, I can finally see the bottom.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;It's so deep!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I don't know what's down there...but we'll soon find out!&quot;

[The leaf platform lands at the bottom.]

Eiko: &quot;Come with me! Are you gonna make a helpless little girl like
      me go all by herself!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wait! There might be some monsters lurking there!&quot;

[Vivi and Eiko go down anyway.]

Dagger: &quot;Say, Zidane... Mog said he sensed life down here. Do you
        sense anything?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, but you sense it, too, don't you? We don't even need
        Mog to tell us there's life down here.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;You're right. I can tell there's something down here.

[Zidane goes down and looks over one of the platform's bows:]

Zidane: &quot;Is it moving...? Just my imagination. So much for Kuja.
         None of his lackeys are here, either. Or maybe we have to
         go down there? I definitely sense something down there.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Zidane!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What's up?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;M-Mog's saying... Something coming from above!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;From above!? Dagger, come here! Now!&quot;

[Dagger heads down but the platform rumbles and she falls over.]

Dagger: &quot;Aaaa!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dagger!!!&quot;

[He runs up to her.]

Zidane: &quot;Are you alright!?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I'm sorry! I was just startled. Is something wrong?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Over there!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It's them! We'd better go, too! Can you stand?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yes, let's go.&quot;

[They run back down to Vivi and Eiko.]

Eiko: &quot;Look! The wall is moving!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;You're right... It's like it's alive!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Eiko! Vivi!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Zidane! The wall's shaking faster!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It's here!&quot;

[A large mass of something drops past.]

Dagger: &quot;What was that!?&quot;

[The mass pulls itself up and looks at the party. It speaks directly
into their minds, too.]

?????: So, it wasn't Kuja.

Vivi: &quot;Huh? What's going on? I can hear a voice inside my head!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You just said Kuja! Where is he!?&quot;

?????: I do not know.

Dagger: &quot;What are you doing here!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Are you the one who makes the Mist!?&quot;

?????: It is not produced... Mist is a by-product of the refining
       process. It is discharged through the roots.

Vivi: &quot;Discharged?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;So it's sent to other continents through the roots, right?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;But why!? Why would you do that!?&quot;

?????: I contaminate the other continents with Mist to stimulate the
       fighting instinct. This, in turn, leads to war among the leaders
       of nations, and then to the fall of civilization. Kuja merely
       puts the by-product to a different use.

Vivi: &quot;A different use!? What is Kuja trying to do!?&quot;

?????: I cannot lie. Kuja used the waste product to make weapons.
       Weapons...like yourself.

Vivi: &quot;!?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;He's really ticking me off! Can I kill him?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wait, Eiko! What kind of weapons did Kuja make?&quot;

?????: Kuja called them black mages, dark spawn of the Mist.

Zidane: &quot;!?&quot;
Dagger: &quot;So the factory in Dali was really...&quot;

?????: Defeat me, and no more Mist will flow. And then no more weapons
       like this puppet will be made. Answer me, puppet. Do you deny
       your very birth?

Zidane: &quot;Why, you--&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...... No more!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Vivi?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I won't let you make any more instruments of murder!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Way to go, Vivi! I know it must be hard for you. We can knock
      off this rat now, right?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright! Let's bust him up! Who knows, it might even lure
        Kuja here!&quot;

?????: I have seen the end of my thousand-year life, and it is not now.
       You cannot stop me. It is futile to even try.

[They give it a shot anyway and knock Soulcage's undead block off.
The bowels of the Iifa Tree shake afterwards.]

Zidane: &quot;Uh oh! Let's get outta here!&quot;

[FMV. Outside, the Mist from the roots blows away in the wind and
stops being produced. On the Mist Continent, the sky over Evil Forest
is de-Misted and sunshine finally shines through...everywhere, the
mist evaporates, actually. The party regroups at the Iifa Tree gate.]

Eiko: &quot;Wow, the air's so clean! The Iifa Tree looks so pretty now.
      Will this clear up your Mist Continent?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I think so. Now, let's see if Kuja shows up. ...Vivi?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Zidane... Did I do the right thing? It said that black mages
      are made from the Mist, right? When I thought about how other
      black mages were being made for war... I didn't want that to
      happen, no matter what. Now, there'll be no more new black
      mages. I think they'll all hate me.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;No way! Listen to me. You should never lie to yourself. After
      all, your brothers wouldn't want you to do that.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Do you really think so? Do you think...they'll understand?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Of course! They're your brothers. It'll be alright. Huh? What
      is it, Mog?&quot;

[Just then, Moco runs to the party.]

Eiko: &quot;Moco!?&quot;

Moco: &quot;Eiko!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;What's the matter? Why did you come all this way? No way!
      Okay, I'll be right back!&quot;

Moco: &quot;Alright, I'll go on ahead and tell the others.&quot;

[Moco leaves.]

Eiko: &quot;You guys are going ot wait hre for Kuja, right? I gotta go back
      to the village!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wait, Eiko! What's up?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Someone stole something precious from the village!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We'll go with you, Eiko!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Thanks, but what about Kuja!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Madain Sari isn't that far. He can wait.&quot;

===========================================================
31. Madain Sari (MS02)
===========================================================

[The party walks into Madain Sari.]

Eiko: &quot;I'm home! I'M HOME!!!&quot;

[The moogles all run to her.]

Eiko: &quot;Moco told me the news. Are you alright?&quot;

Morrison: &quot;Come now! Talk later, kupo!&quot;

Moogle: &quot;Kupo!&quot;
Morrison: &quot;Kupo!!!&quot;

[Eiko runs off after the moogles.]

Zidane: &quot;H-Hey, Eiko! We'd better follow her!&quot;

[They find her in a room below the kitchen.]

Zidane: &quot;What's going on, Eiko?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;It's... It's... The precious stone that has been passed down
      in this village for generations is gone! My grandparents said...
      They said that we should take care of it because it's a symbol
      of the summoners' heritage.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Well...how about crying for a change? It'll help.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;I'm not gonna cry! I'm a grown-up now, and crying won't help
      one bit!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright. How about we start looking for clues?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I'll help, too.&quot;

Eiko: &lt;Hiccup.&gt; &quot;Is it...&quot; &lt;Hiccup.&gt; &quot;Is it my fault?&quot; &lt;Hiccup.&gt; &quot;Is
      it 'cause I broke my promise and opened the Iifa Tree's seal?&quot;
      &lt;Hiccup.&gt; &quot;Everyone...everyone was watching over the stone.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Eiko? It just happened that way! It wasn't your fault.&quot;

Eiko: &lt;Hiccup.&gt;

Zidane: &quot;Besides, we're the ones who made you open the seal! You
        understand, right? The real villain is the one who stole it.
        So, let's look for some clues and get that stone back, okay?&quot;

Eiko: &lt;Hiccup.&gt; &quot;Okay! I wasn't going to cry, you know! After all,
      I'm a grown-up!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We know, Eiko. But if you feel like crying, just cry.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;I'm gonna go pray to my grandparents! I'll be right back.&quot;

[Eiko leaves.]

Zidane: &quot;If you need to, you can cry, too, Dagger. My shoulder's
        always available.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yeah, thanks. What about you, Zidane? What do you do when
        you need to cry?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh, I get really clingy when I'm sad!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Cut it out!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, I was serious.&quot;

[Someone screams.]

Dagger: &quot;!!!&quot;
Zidane: &quot;!!!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I heard a scream. It sounded like Eiko!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dammit! The thief was still here!&quot;

[Vivi runs in.]

Vivi: &quot;Zidane, I saw her! It's that girl from Fossil Roo! She took
      Eiko... They went to the Eidolon Wall!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Let's go!&quot;

[They run to the Eidolon Wall.]

Morrison: &quot;Look what happened to Eiko... The ancestors will be
          displeased. Tell us if there's anything we can do for you,
          kupo!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hmm...&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Peek inside
        R2 --&gt; Heal us
        R3 --&gt; Hold on a sec

        R1: [Inside, Lani holds a flailing Eiko by the back of her dress.]

            Eiko: &quot;This is no way to treat a lady!&quot;

            Lani: &quot;What's this ornament thing on your back? It makes
                  you so easy to pick up.&quot;

            Eiko: &quot;My grandpa gave it to me! Get your grubby hands off
                  of it!&quot;

            Lani: &quot;Oh, shut up. Just be still until he gets here.&quot;

        R2 (Narrative): HP and MP Restored! Status effects removed!

        R3 (Morrison): &quot;Tell us if there's anything we can do for
                       you, kupo!&quot; [Zidane can walk around again.]

[After peeking inside:]

Moco: &quot;I found a treasure, Kupo!&quot;

Chimomo: &quot;Use it for Eiko, kupo!&quot;

[Zidane gets an Exploda and Elixir.]

Morrison: &quot;Tell us if there's anything we can do for you, kupo!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hmm...&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Where's Mog?
        R2 --&gt; Heal us
        R3 --&gt; Hold on a sec

        R1: &quot;Was Mog captured, too?&quot;

            Morrison: Nope, Mog is right here behind me.&quot;

            Mog: &quot;Kupo...&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;Mog, I need your help to save Eiko.&quot;

            Mog: &quot;Ku-Kupo...&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;I got an idea. It's alright. You won't be in any
                    danger.&quot;

            Mog: &quot;Ku...po...&quot;

            Morrison: &quot;It's no use. Mog has always been a coward.&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;Yeah... Well, we gotta do something.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hmm...&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Go save her
        R2 --&gt; Heal us
        R3 --&gt; Hold on a sec

[By picking R1 (the other options are the same as listed above):]

Zidane: &quot;Alright, let's go!&quot;

[The party goes into the Eidolon Wall. Eiko is no longer moving.]

Lani: &quot;Well, so there's my good sir knight.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What have you done to Eiko!?

Lani: &quot;She was too rambunctious, so I put her to sleep with a sleeping
      weed.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Sleeping weed, eh? Then she's probably sleeping well.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;If it's my pendant you're after, then leave the others out of it!&quot;

Lani: &quot;No can do. This is way too convenient to pass up! Hand over your
      pendant, and I'll hand over the girl, capice? What happened to the
      pendant that you always have on!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I have it.&quot;

Lani: &quot;Oh, you really are a good knight. Now, cough it up already!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;First, tell me something. Was it you who stole the village stone?&quot;

Lani: &quot;Queen Brahne is after the royal pendant. I found another jewel just
      like it in this village! I'm glad I came all this way looking for it!
      Now, hand it over!&quot;

Zidane: (If only Eiko was conscious...)

Lani: &quot;Hold on! You're plotting something, aren't you? Stay right there!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Grr!&quot;

Lani: &quot;You, black mage!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Huh? M-Me?&quot;

Lani: &quot;Bring me the pendant! Remember, do as I say if you value this brat's
      life!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Zidane...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Do it, Vivi.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;O-Okay...&quot;

[Vivi takes the jewel to Lani.]

Lani: &quot;Hahaha...&quot;

Voice: &quot;Hold it!&quot;

[The red-haired man appears and jumps down at Lani, who drops Eiko
into Zidane's arms.]

Lani: &quot;Aaa!!!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I dunno who you are, but thanks!&quot;

Red-haired Man: &quot;......&quot;

Eiko: &lt;Yawn.&gt;

Zidane: &quot;Yo, can you stand?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Huh? What's going on? !!!  Where's that old hag?&quot;

Lani: &quot;Oh, that's it! Who are you calling a hag!?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;You!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So, the tables turn! Now, hand over the jewel you stole!&quot;

Lani: &quot;What are you tryin' to do, Red!? I thought you're supposed to
      be the number one bandit!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I've seen him before... He's the one with wanted posters all
        over Treno!&quot;

Red-haired Man: &quot;I'm not here to help. I just want it to be fair.&quot;

Lani: &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

Red-haired Man: &quot;Leave the jewel and get out of here.&quot;

Lani: &quot;What!? We're partners on this job!&quot;

Red-haired Man: &quot;I don't work with hostage-taking scumbags. Now, get lost.
                Or...would you rather fight me?&quot;

Lani: &quot;Mark my words! I'll collect the bounty on YOU someday!&quot;

[Lani jumps onto a pillar and runs away.]

Red-haired Man: &quot;Now, fight me!&quot;
</pre><pre id="faqspan-8">
Zidane: &quot;Just a second here. What's going on?&quot;

Red-haired Man: &quot;I told you. I'm not here to help. I just want to
                level the playing field.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Fair enough. Let's do it.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It's okay. I was just looking for more ways to impress you!&quot;

[Zidane defeats 'Scarlet Hair'.]

Red-haired Man: &quot;I...lost? Go on. Finish me!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Can you stand?&quot;

Red-haired Man: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Give back what you stole.&quot;

Red-haired Man: &quot;......&quot;

[He does the honorable thing and returns the stolen jewel.]

Zidane: &quot;Eiko, I got it back!&quot;

Red-haired Man: &quot;Now, finish me!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You wanna die that bad? I just spared your life.&quot;

Red-haired Man: &quot;So you want to banish me, then?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You can go if ya want. I won't follow you.&quot;

Red-haired Man: &quot;Aha! Trying to trick me, eh?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Trick you?&quot;

Red-haired Man: &quot;I tried to kill you. Why are you letting me go?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;The fight's over, and we're both still alive. Good enough,
        right? We got back what was stolen from us, after all.&quot;

Red-haired Man: &quot;Listen to you. I lost to some spineless thief.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;The sly eagle doesn't kill at whim.&quot;

Red-haired Man: &quot;......&quot;

[The man jumps on a pillar and then disappears over the wall.]

Zidane: &quot;Keep that in a safe place.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;I will! Thanks, Zidane!&quot;

[She starts to leave and turns to Vivi.]

Eiko: &quot;Well!? You're not going to leave me alone after what just
      happened, are you!?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Huh?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;I'm going!&quot;

[Vivi follows her.]

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Shall we?&quot;

[They find Eiko and Vivi in the room 'neath the kitchen, again.]

Vivi: &quot;She's been quiet the whole time.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Zidane, let me ask you something. My grandfather told me not to
      leave the village until my sixteenth birthday... But I want to go
      with you guys! I really do! Do you think it's okay if I leave the
      village?&quot;
      R1 --&gt; Yes
      R2 --&gt; No

      R1 (Zidane): &quot;                       'Eiko, come with us.
                   Forget what your grandpa said.'&quot;

         Eiko: &quot;......&quot;

      R2 (Zidane): &quot;You want me to stop you? Fine. 'Stay here 'til
                   you're sixteen. Keep the promise you made to your
                   grandpa.'

         Eiko: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It doesn't matter what I say. You've already made up your
        mind.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Don't you have something to say to her, Vivi?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Huh?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;......&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Remember what you taught me at the Iifa Tree? You said I
      shouldn't ever lie to myself. I'll try to be more honest with
      my own feelings... You should, too, Eiko...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Hmmm... I forgot my own advice, Vivi! Thanks! I'll wear the
      jewel as an earring. It'll be okay then, right, Zidane?&quot;

[Receive: Memory Earring]

Dagger: &quot;Eiko? I think Mog wants to talk to you.&quot;

[Mog comes in.]

Mog: &quot;Ku-Kupo.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;......&quot;

Mog: &quot;Kuuupoh!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;What? You think I'm mad at you? I'm furious! You went off
      without me again! You promised me you wouldn't! What would you
      do if you went off and got into trouble!?&quot;

Mog: &quot;Kupo...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Oh, well. Thank goodness we're both alright.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;You're always nice to Mog, aren't you, Eiko?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Well, yeah. We're best friends, after all! We were born on the
      same day, and we have always been together! This is our friendship
      ribbon! Mog gave it to me! Mog, do you have the ribbon I gave you?&quot;

Mog: &quot;Kupo!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;This is the one I gave to Mog! It's too big for her now, but
      once we're both sophisticated ladies, we'll wear them together!&quot;

Mog: &quot;Kupo!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Maybe then, Zidane, you'll dance with me? Zidane?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I didn't know Mog was a girl...&quot;

[Zidane walks out of the room.]

Zidane: &quot;I wonder where Dagger went...?&quot;

[Zidane finds a &quot;?&quot; up on the balcony.]

Zidane: &quot;I can hear a song... Dagger...? From down there? Dagger,
        you there?&quot;

[Zidane goes down to the dock somehow. Dagger's sitting in a boat.]

Dagger: &quot;Zidane...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It's okay. Keep singing. 'Cause it's our song, right? I'm
        surprised you found this place. You got the talent to be a
        bandit! How 'bout you and me team up? We'll call ourselves
        'The Betrothed.'&quot;

Dagger: &quot;My talent's up to snuff, but that name isn't.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hehehe. You're really something these days.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;If I am, I must've gotten it from you.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Naw... It's all because you made the effort to learn.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;No, it's because you stuck with me. Without you, I couldn't
        have made it to Lindblum, much less seen a whole new continent.
        Everything I tried to do on my own was a total failure. I couldn't
        stop my mother... At times I almost lost hope... You helped me so
        much... Not just you, either.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah... Vivi and Eiko helped out at the Iifa Tree. Quina was real
        helpful when we left the continent. Freya, Steiner...and even
        Beatrix, who I thought was our enemy.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I haven't forgotten... I want to believe everyone is alright, but
        sometimes I just can't. I hope I can live up to the hopes of
        everyone who has helped me.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You don't have to feel so responsible, Dagger.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;But I do!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Nobody wants you to feel that way. They didn't do it all for you,
        either. Each was following his own path.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;His own...path? Well, what about you?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Huh?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Why did you come with me?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, that's Ipsen's line.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Ipsen? Who's that?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Ipsen is a character from a play, but he's a real-life adventurer.
        I think the play is based on his adventures. It kind of goes like
        this... Ipsen and his good friend Colin worked at a tavern in Treno.
        One day Ipsen got a letter. The letter was so wet from rain that
        most of the writing was illegible. The only part he could read said
        'Come back home.' Nowadays, we have airships and stuff, but back
        then, it was really hard to travel. He didn't know why he had to go
        back, but he got some time off, gathered his things, and set out on
        his journey home. He walked a thousand leagues through the Mist.
        Sometimes he was attacked by vicious monsters, but he made it,
        because his friend Colin was by his side. And then, after much time
        on the road... He had to ask Colin something. 'Why did you come with
        me?'&quot;

Dagger: &quot;And? What was Colin's answer?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;'Only because I wanted to go with you.'&quot;

[The boat carries the two out to sea, slowly.]

Dagger: &quot;Zidane... I... ...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dagger?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Can't you... Can't you hear the song?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Huh!? Yeah... It's that song!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;How come... Who's singing it!? !!! The sun makes the Eidolon
        Wall look like it's on fire! I've seen this somewhere before...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What? Where?&quot;

[FMV. Garnet watches the Eidolon Wall and has a flashback of the past
when a large eye in the sky loomed over the flaming village. In a tiny
boat at sea, a toddler Garnet (!?) and her mother (?) were thrashed
around by the sea, away from Madain Sari. Zidane catches Dagger as she
collapses.]

Zidane: &quot;Dagger! Dagger!? Wake up!&quot;

[Later on, Dagger, Eiko, Mog, and Zidane sit around the kitchen table.]

Zidane: &quot;Where's Vivi?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;He's sleeping. I don't wanna wake him up.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Well?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I have no memory of my early childhood. I never really thought
        about it. Besides, nobody ever told me. I was raised in
        Alexandria...but only from the age of six or so.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Six!? So where you were you till then?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Until then... Until I turned six... I must have been here,
        in Madain Sari. I still can't remember everything. Some things
        are like they're shrouded in fog. But I do remember one thing...
        About ten years ago, an unbelievably huge hurricane hit this
        village. That's as far as I remember. That day, I...I was with
        my true mother on a little boat, far from the village. There's
        a cove behind Eiko's house, right? The boat I was on was just
        like the one there. It all came back to me when I heard that
        song on the boat.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That song is from Madain Sari. That's why nobody else knows it.&quot;

[The party walks to the Eidolon Wall.]

Eiko: &quot;How did you get to Alexandria? How come you got to be a princess?
      How come you don't have a summoner's horn?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I don't know. But maybe Doctor Tot can tell me. About the lady
        who protected me from the storm as the boat lurched about in the
        waves... My biological mother, who died on that boat.&quot;

Zidane: (The woman she thought was her mother was someone else, and her
        true mother was already dead... Dagger has lost two mothers...)

Dagger: &quot;I used to pray every day here, at the Eidolon Wall.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;You, too?

Dagger: &quot;You pray here, too, Eiko? I'm so happy I remembered.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Dagger! Welcome home!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;So glad to be back.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Ahaha.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;I just realized that I'm not alone anymore! Yep, I made up
      my mind! Zidane, Dagger, I'm going with you! I'll be breaking
      my promise to my grandpa, but I wanna go! Besides, grandpa
      always told me to be honest with myself!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I don't know what the future holds... But I want to finish
        what I came here for.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So do I! Let's all go together!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Come on, Dagger, let's go pray together!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Alright!

[The next day, at the town gates:]

Dagger: (I still don't know what I should do... By the time we defeat
        Kuja and return to Alexandria...)

Eiko: &quot;Grandpa, I'll be back soon!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Oh, you're coming with us!?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Hey! Why the long face!?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Oh, nothing... My face is always like this.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Mog's coming, too! Mog!!!&quot;

[Mog flies over. The other five moogles pop out, giving their &quot;Kupo!&quot;s
as they see fit.]

Morrison: &quot;Lady Eiko! Now, don't forget that you'll always have a home
          in Madain Sari. Don't let our memory become a burden. You
          must always be light-hearted and free. Thoughts of the Eidolon
          Wall will always lift your heart.&quot;

[Eiko nods and Mog jumps into her dress. Just then, the red-haired
man who fought Zidane walks over.]

Zidane: &quot;What now? You want some more, eh?&quot;

Red-headed Man: &quot;The victor lives, the defeated die. You know the rules.
                Your actions yesterday were incomprehensible to me. Tell
                me! Why didn't you kill me!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Well, that's a tough question... Are you really that unhappy that
        I let you live?&quot;

Red-headed Man: &quot;I'd rather die as a warrior than live as a beggar.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Then come with me.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane!?&quot;
Vivi: &quot;What!?&quot;

Red-headed Man: &quot;What are you after?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Follow me and maybe you'll understand. Besides, you're pretty
        good in a fight. We could use someone like you. We're hunting
        a man down.&quot;

Red-headed Man: (Hmph. His only constant is his unpredictability...)

Zidane: &quot;Huh? You say something'?&quot;

Red-headed Man: &quot;Very well. I'll find out what makes you so strong.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What's your name?&quot;

Red-headed Man: &quot;Call me what you will.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hmm... Lani called you 'Red,' right?&quot;

[His default name is 'Amarant'.]

Red-headed Man: &quot;Some call me the Flaming Amarant.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Fine. We'll call you Amarant. The more the merrier. Let's
        decide our marching order.&quot;

[Zidane picks the party.]

Zidane: &quot;Alright. We'll do fine. Just follow me! Next stop, the Iifa
        Tree!&quot;

===========================================================
32. Iifa Tree (IT02)
===========================================================

[The party walks to where they broke the seal.]

Zidane: &quot;There's still a little Mist, but at least there's no more
        coming out. That must mean Kuja isn't here yet.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;And what happened to the Mist?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;We beat the beast that breathes it. So much for the Mist
      Continent!&quot;

Amarant: &quot;No more Mist...?&quot; (They must possess incredible powers to
         accomplish such a feat.)&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane, there's a silver dragon!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It's him! He flew from the ruins of Burmecia riding a
        silver dragon! It's Kuja alright! And he's riding that
        dragon!&quot;

[Up in the air, Kuja stands atop his dragon.]

Kuja: &quot;Oh, how I've longed for this day. ...the day I might finally
      cast away this mask to reveal my true self. Now it no longer
      matters if the Iifa Tree is liberated! It means nothing to me!
      Mwahaha... The tree is so beautiful! Its beauty becomes the
      great mother tree that lives among the stars! Silver Dragon, let
      us watch the drama unfold from the trunk of Iifa. No one shall
      interrupt us there.&quot;

[Back down below...]

Zidane: &quot;Who do I wanna take with me to fight Kuja...?&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Change party members
        R2 --&gt; Go to menu
        R3 --&gt; Keep current members

        R1: [Zidane can change party members.]
        R2: [The menu opens.]
        R3: [The process is completed; Zidane can run in, now.]

[The party starts running along the roots.]

Zidane: &quot;We'll pass the trunk if we go any farther. Kuja went down
        that trunk.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Say, Zidane... How are we gonna get up there?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Can't we climb there?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Not me!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;M-Me neither.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I don't think I can, either.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We came all this way... Now what?&quot;

Amarant: &quot;What's the problem? You should just go by yourself!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We gotta go face Kuja together.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;How did this wimp end up beating me?&quot;

[He starts walking by the others.]

Vivi: &quot;Whoa!&quot;
Dagger: &quot;Hey!&quot;
Eiko: &quot;You almost knocked me down!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, Amarant! Watch where you're walking!&quot;

Amarant: &quot;'He who hesitates is lost.' You'd best remember that.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Well, I prefer 'My way or the highway.'&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Whatever. Like you actually have a plan.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Oh yeah, smarty-pants!? Don't forget you're the one who lost
      to Zidane.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Shut up, brat.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;A plan, huh? That's right, Amarant! You owe me one, rememer?
        It's payback time!&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Shoot.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;There's some gargant grass around here, so a gargant can't
        be far. I want you to catch one for me. Then we can all get
        on and ride it to the top.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Why should I do that when I can just take the kids up myself?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Huh...?&quot;

Amarant: &quot;How'd I ever let this dimwit beat me?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;H-Hey!&quot;
Vivi: &quot;Whoa!&quot;

[Amarant puts the two kids under his arms and jumps off the root,
heading for the trunk.]

Zidane: &quot;He sure has spirit. Alright, Dagger... I'll just carry you
        piggyback.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Huh? Hey! Zidane! Wait just a--&quot;

[Up on the trunk, Kuja and his dragon stand.]

Kuja: &quot;The weak lose their freedom to the strong. Such is the way of
      the strong. And it is the providence of nature that only the
      strong survive. That is why I needed strength. I learned of power
      that would daunt even him...over ten years ago. Such a long time...
      Now my forces are ready to strike! Ahh... The suspense is terrible!
      So they've come this far, have they? Perfect. I'll warm up to them
      until the elephant-lady shows up.&quot;

[The party regroups up on the trunk.]

Zidane: &quot;Thanks, Amarant!&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Now we're even. Show me what you guys can do.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;There's Kuja!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah. Get ready, guys!&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Organize party
        R2 --&gt; Menu
        R3 --&gt; Finished

        R1: [Party select screen opens.]
        R2: [Menu opens.]
        R3: [See below.]

[After R3:]

Vivi: &quot;Kuja... Maker of black mages...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Any enemy of Zidane is an enemy of mine!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Okay, let's go!&quot;

[The party sprints to a root near Kuja.]

Dagger: &quot;You are Kuja, correct? My name is... ...Princess Garnet Til
        Alexandros. I wish to ask you something. Was it really you who
        persuaded my mother to start the war--&quot;

Kuja: &quot;The war that threw the entire Mist Continent into chaos?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;And you made everyone...the black mages...into instruments of war!?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Oh, dear... The princess has such a bloodthirsty little puppet.
      I don't have the power to do such a thing. I just gave them a little
      recipe. Begin with broth of Mist, and fermented souls, and boil...
      Then, pour genuine black magic into a mixing bowl and heat to--&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Stop it!&quot;


Kuja: &quot;I'm not done telling how to make soulless toys out of the dregs
      of souls!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dregs of souls? You mean Mist!?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;First, you don't want to listen, now you start asking questions?
      Oh, brother... But you're not ready yet!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Why, you-- don't you feel anything!? Taking the lives of so
        many...&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Spare me the lecture. Lives come and go all the time. What's the
      big deal? Speaking of warmongers, why... what about that mother of
      yours, Princess? She said she won't feel alive until she has
      everything! It breaks my heart to see such greed! The war was my
      fault? No, no! Your mother wanted it! All I did was give her a little
      push!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Liar! My mother was sweet and kind. You changed her!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Mwahaha... So the curtain rises! Perfect, my canary. Let me show
      you the truth about your mother! First Act: The End of Ugly Desire.
      It's showtime!&quot;

[FMV. Brahne's fleet gathers near the Iifa Tree.]

Brahne: &quot;Bwahahaha! Kuja! So you finally decided to show your girly
        face here! You're all that stands between me and total domination!
        Gehehe! But I haven't forgotten all you've done for me! In return,
        I will show you the ultimate power! Attention, all hands! Order the
        black mages to focus all their magical energies into a single spell!
        Lay suppressing fire upon Kuja until the casting is finished! Fire!
        Fire at will!!!&quot;

[On one of other boats:]

Senior Officer: &quot;Orders from Her Majesty! Black mages, focus all your
                magical energies into a single spell!&quot;

[Back on the trunk, the party sees the fleet gathering around Iifa.]

Dagger: &quot;I...I can't believe it!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Your mother isn't satisfied with just one continent! Her ugliness
      and stupidity are truly impressive. Ahh... everything is proceeding
      as I have foreseen.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What are you talking about!?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;You're just the opening number. Time for the real show.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We won't let you get away!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;The Mist may be created no more, but it still lurks in the caves
      and forests, right?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Huh!?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;I can make monsters with magic! Come forth, spawn of the mist!&quot;

[Kuja sics two Mistodons on the party. When the party defeats them,
they find Kuja's flown the coop.]

Amarant: &quot;So, two of your enemies are dukin' it out? Why not leave 'em,
         and finish off the winner? My money's on Kuja.&quot;

[Kuja rides in the air on the dragon once more.]

Kuja: &quot;Hahaha! Foolish Brahne! Your cannons are useless against the
      spawn of the Mist! Mwahaha... but even a fool like you knows that
      there is only one path you can take, right? Stupid elephant-lady!
      Why do you hesitate? Very well... I'll make the first move. I'll
      give you a clean target. You can't miss! Silver Dragon, descend!&quot;

[Back on the trunk:]

Zidane: &quot;Amarant's right. Let's split before we get dragged in.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;No... I can't... I can't let anything happen to my mother.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dagger?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane, I... I have to save her!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Uhh, Dagger? She extracted eidolons from you and started a war!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I still don't want her to die!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;But she didn't care one bit whether you lived or died! You don't
        have to call her mother anymore!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;She's my only mother! I don't care if you don't understand!
        Eiko, you said that there was an eidolon imprisoned near here,
        right?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Uh, yeah.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Please! Tell me where!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;It's a long way down. You see the place with lots of roots?
      That's it.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;There. I see it.&quot;

[Dagger bolts.]

Eiko: &quot;Dagger, don't go alone!&quot;

[The party's attacked by another Mistodon, but they slice it up good.]

Amarant: &quot;Hehe... This is turning into quite a show.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Anyone can get emotional at a time like this! Give her a break!
      Zidane, let's go. Dagger's in danger all by herself.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah... Let's go after her.&quot;

[The party runs down a lower root; Dagger stands at an old shrine,
shaped like a serpent.]

Dagger: &quot;I sense the eidolon's power! Now... Now I can save my mother!&quot;
        (Please help me...)

[The statue lights up and two gigantic wings appear on its back. But,
only an Aquamarine falls into Dagger's hand.]

Dagger: &quot;...No! I can't save my mother with this eidolon!&quot;

[The party arrives.]

Eiko: &quot;Dagger! What's wrong? Can't you free it?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;No, I have it. I sense it's a great eidolon. But...but...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;I don't believe it! This is the legendary sea serpent, Leviathan!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Leviathan!?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;An eidolon who wipes out its enemies with a huge wave! I&quot;m sorry,
      Dagger!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;No, it's not your fault. But my mother's still in danger!&quot;

[On one of the boats with the mages:]

Cannoneer: &quot;Isn't Her Majesty ready yet!? All remaining ammunition was
           spent on that last wave of monsters! The next wave will chew
           us up unless we pull out now!&quot;

Senior Officer: &quot;That is not your decision! Get back to your post, soldier!&quot;

[On Brahne's ship:]

Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;Your Majesty, the black mages have completed their
                     preparations.&quot;

Brahne: &quot;That insolent whelp! Now I can finish him off! Come! Draconic
        Seedling! Bahamut, King of Dragons!&quot;

[FMV. Brahne summons Bahamut, which quickly shoots massive fireballs
at Kuja, destroying part of the seaboard in no time at all. Kuja flees
with ease, and the dragon only succeeds in making him bleed a little.]

Amarant: &quot;I've heard the stories, but I never thought summoning could
         be so powerful.&quot; (If Zidane is after their power, I'd better
         watch out...)

Dagger: &quot;Now... Now we can win! And Mother won't have to die! Eiko,
        don't you think... What's wrong?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Mog... She's terrified!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;How come? Don't you know? That's the last eidolon, Bahamut,
        the Dragon King! He'll win for sure!&quot;

[Up in the air:]

Kuja: &quot;Blood... Hahahaha... Excellent, Bahamut! Power, mobility...
      You truly are the best! You even hurt me...a little. And you,
      Brahne... Your tragic role in this drama now comes to an end!
      I'm sure you'll enjoy the second act from your soul's hellish
      prison, since the stage will be your former home! The final act
      will take us away from Gaia, and I will kill my nemesis...with
      my own hand! Hahaha! Everything is going according to plan.&quot;

[FMV. Kuja makes the clouds part and the giant eye in the sky appears.
Bahamut starts to go mad, and the black mages start to mess up. Bahamut
stands in front of Brahne's ship and blows a fireball,exploding it.
The other ships, too, suffer the same fate, and Bahamut flies out of
the area in a disappearing act. Kuja rides the clouds out of there as
well. Later on, Vivi narrates the party's finding at the beach in the
aftermath.]

Vivi: I don't know why Bahamut attacked the one who summoned him. But
      we found Queen Brahne on the beach, next to her escape pod. She
      could hardly move. And I thought she'd come to a stop any second.
      I hate Kuja a lot. But I hate Brahne a lot, too... ...so much that
      I wanted this to happen to her. I should be happy, but... Once I
      saw Dagger start to cry, I didn't know how I should feel. I kind of
      wanted to cry, too...

[Away from the others, Dagger kneels near her mother, who's lying on
her back.]

Brahne: &quot;I...I...can hear...my daughter's voice.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yes, Mother! I'm here! Right here...

Brahne: &quot;I...I am empty now... Free... Free...of that...terrible...
        greed...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Mother...&quot;

Brahne: &quot;I haven't...felt this way...since I saw that play...with
        you...and your father. I led...Alexandria...down...the path...
        of ruin... The people...will be...happier...with you...on the
        throne...&quot;

[Brahne dies. Vivi's words restart.]

Vivi: We went back to Alexandria on Queen Brahne's escape pod. We also
      brought... Dagger's mother with us...&quot;

[Somewhere in Alexandria, Tot walks into a gazebo-type area with a
shrine in the middle.]

Tot: &quot;This way, Princess.&quot;

[Dagger, Steiner, and Beatrix appear.]

Dagger: &quot;Steiner, Beatrix... How horrible that her life had to end
        this way. I still can't believe all that has happend...&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Princess, it was my...&quot;
Steiner: &quot;No! It was my fault!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Thank you, both of you... I must now carry the burden of
        ruling Alexandria alone. Will both of you please help me during
        this, my time of need?&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Certainly!&quot;
Steiner: &quot;Yes, Princess!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Thank you.&quot;

[Dagger walks to Tot, holding a wreath.]

Tot: &quot;Princess, here is a wreath of roses, your mother's favorite.
     The townspeople sent it as an offering for the queen's grave.
     True, Queen Brahne had been acting quite erratic before her
     death... ...but the people are still very fond of her, as you
     can see.&quot;

[Dagger puts it next to the memorial; Dagger and Beatrix salute it.]

Dagger: &quot;Mother... I shall become a great queen!&quot;

[FMV. Dagger walks down the memorial's steps to the lakeside overlooking
the castle. She gazes at the reflection and castle, then turns around with
a determination in her eyes.]

===========================================================
33. Alexandria Castle (AL03)
===========================================================

[Tot, Dagger, and her two guards arrive at the castle via a gondola.]

Tot: &quot;Princess, we have arrived at the castle.&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;She won't be a princess for much longer, Doctor Tot.&quot;

Tot: &quot;Ha ha ha... Indeed. I shall have to call you 'Queen Garnet'
     after the coronation. I must make preparations for the crowning
     of our new queen. General Beatrix, Master Steiner, will you help
     her? Princess, please watch your step.&quot;

[Dagger gets off the boat.]

Dagger: &quot;Doctor Tot...&quot;

Tot: &quot;Princess... I know how hard this must be. But I will be by your
     side. Please take the throne with full confidence.&quot;

[Everyone leaves except Steiner, who rowed the boat.]

Steiner: &quot;Three more days until the crowning of a new queen... What a day!&quot;

[In the pub, the Tantalus gang (sans Baku) is reunited with Ruby.]

Ruby: &quot;We ain't seen each other in ages! Why the sour puss, partner?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;What happened?&quot;

Blank: &quot;Maybe that Dagger chick dumped him.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;......&quot;

Cinna: &quot;Bingo...&quot;

Ruby: &quot;This ain't like you at all, Zidane!&quot;

Cinna: &quot;H-Hey, Ruby! I heard you started a mini-theater.&quot;

Ruby: &quot;That's right, darlin'! My plays are a hit!&quot;

Blank: &quot;Cool! Let's go watch!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Yeah!&quot;

Ruby: &quot;Alright, cowboys! Zidane... You ain't comin', are ya? That's
      awright, darlin'. Come on over whenever you want. Let's go,
      boys!&quot;

[Everyone but Zidane clears out of the bar, onto the street.]

Ruby: &quot;This way, everyone!&quot;

[Blank runs by Vivi and knocks him down.]

Blank: &quot;Oops! Sorry... Huh!? Hey, Vivi!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Hello...&quot;

Blank: &quot;I haven't seen ya since you left Alexandria Castle. How are ya?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Well, a lot of things happened, but I'm doing fine. How about
      you? What have you been doing since we left the castle?&quot;

Blank: &quot;Me? Let's see... Oh yeah, it's been crazy since you guys
       escaped! Rusty, that rat chick, Freya, and... ...what's her
       face, that girl general of Alexandria...&quot;

Voice: &quot;Beatrix.&quot;

[Marcus walks over.]

Blank: &quot;Yeah, the three of them got totally worked! Marcus and I had
       to carry 'em out on our backs! M-Marcus!?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;We gotta get goin' before Ruby gets mad at us again.&quot;

Blank: &quot;Oh yeah, she hates it when we're late... Sorry, Vivi. I'll
       see you later!&quot;

[Vivi walks around town and finds Blank and company outside the
theater. A few scenes where he talks to them and takes the brunt of
Ruby's anger plays (see: AL26 for all dialogue). Afterwards, a scene
with Dagger in her room plays.]

Dagger: &quot;Steiner?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Yes, Princess!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Um... I'd like to find Zidane and talk to him...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess, you have more important matters at hand! You live
         in a different world now!&quot;

[Just then, Tot walks in.]

Tot: &quot;O-Oh. What's happening here? Princess, it is time for you to
     get changed. General Beatrix, will you help her?&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Yes, sir!&quot;

Tot: &quot;Oh, there is something I must give you, Princess. Those stones
     contain your power, which Queen Brahne forcibly... Well, that is
     all in the past...&quot;

[He walks to the door.]

Tot: &quot;Master Steiner...? Master Steiner, do you intend to stay here
     and watch?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;N-No, I am not... E-Excuse me!&quot;

[The men leave.]

Dagger: &quot;Beatrix... I'd like to see Zidane... Please?&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Now may not be a good time.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Even you agree with Steiner.&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Your Highness...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I know... It's okay.&quot;

[Down near the guardhouse hallway, Eiko skips along.]

Eiko: &quot;With Dagger out of the picture, now's my chance to win
      Zidane's heart! First, I'll write him a love letter. I'm gonna
      make it the most romantic letter ever written!&quot;

[On the walkway above, Tot talks to himself like normal.]

Tot: &quot;Becoming a queen may place quite a burden on Princess Garnet...
     But she must persevere. The people of Alexandria are watching.&quot;

[Tot heads down the stairs and Eiko sees him.]

Eiko: &quot;He looks pretty smart! Hey, you look like the bookish type!&quot;

Tot: &quot;Ha ha ha... What gives you that impression?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;You really want me to explain?&quot;

Tot: &quot;Oh, yes. I'm very curious.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Where should I start...? First, your beard! Second, your
      nerdy hat! Third, your thick eyeglasses! All signs of a nerdy
      philosopher!&quot;

Tot: &quot;Ha ha... You don't hold back, do you?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Hey, are you a writer?&quot;

Tot: &quot;Well, yes. I did make my living as a writer for a while.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Will you help me write a letter?&quot;

Tot: &quot;A letter? Gladly, if you think I can be of assistance.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Okay, then. Follow me.&quot;

[Eiko walks away.]

Tot: &quot;That girl has a horn... That horn... I had completely forgotten
     about it until now... I'd never been as surprised as I was that
     day. A ship drifted ashore after a storm... Inside the ship were
     a woman and a baby girl... The woman was dead, but the girl was
     still breathing... Imagine my surprise as I looked into the
     girl's face! Because the girl... ...looked exactly like Princess
     Garnet, who had just passed away. With one exception... She had a
     horn! A human with a horn... Wher did she come from? The king
     ordered the girl's horn removed. The girl cried out in pain...
     He and his wife, Queen Brahne, decided to raise he girl as
     Princess Garnet... But that girl who spoke to me... Could she be
     related to Princess Garnet...?&quot;

[Eiko comes back over.]

Eiko: &quot;Hey, will you hurry up?&quot;

Tot: &quot;Oh, excuse me.&quot;

[Back in Garnet's room:]

Beatrix: &quot;Princess, you look splendid.&quot;

[Garnet's in her royal gown, now.]

Dagger: &quot;Thank you... By the way... There is something I must tell
        you, Beatrix.&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Yes, Princess?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I am not my mother's... I mean, Queen Brahne is not my real
        mother.&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Princess Garnet... Doctor Tot has already informed us.
         However... My alliegance to you remains the same, if not
         stronger.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Beatrix... Thank you...&quot;

[Inside the guardhouse:]

Eiko: &quot;It's finished! Zidane will fall in love with me the instant he
      reads this letter! Thanks, Mister!&quot;

Tot: &quot;Ha ha... It was my pleasure, my lady.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Oh, I forgot to tell you. My name is Eiko! I'm from Madain
      Sari! I hope to see you again! Buh-Bye!&quot;

[Eiko runs out with her letter.]

Tot: &quot;From Madain Sari...? Madain Sari is the village of the summoners...
     But I thought it was only a legend. What could this mean...?&quot;

[Eiko runs into the balcony screen.]

Eiko: &quot;Oh, I can't wait to hand this letter to Zidane! Where did he
      go, anyway?&quot;

[Eiko starts running along a balcony side, but Baku inadvertantly
belly-bumps her off.]

Eiko: &quot;Aaaah!&quot;

[She gets stuck on a jutting piece of architecture and dangles.]

Eiko: &quot;AHHH!!! HELP!!!&quot;

Baku: &quot;Hey, are you okay?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;C-C-Can't breathe...!!!&quot;

Baku: &quot;Sorry! I didn't see ya jump out. But yer too high up! I can't
      getcha down! Gwahahaha!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Stop laughing, you poop! Oh, shoot. My letter...&quot;

[The letter she dropped flitters down to Baku.]

Eiko: &quot;Hey, if you can't get me down... ...deliver that letter to
      Zidane! Alright!?&quot;

Baku: &quot;To Zidane? Yeah, no problem. Gwahahaha!&quot;

[Baku walks off with the letter.]

Eiko: &quot;What am I supposed to do now!?&quot;

[Baku walks out to the castle gondola dock.]

Baku: &quot;Hey, the boat ain't here!&quot;

[Steiner and two Pluto Knights run by.]

Steiner: &quot;Castle patrol, completed! Huh? Why, if it isn't Baku, the
         leader of Tantalus!&quot;

Baku: &quot;Who just called my name? Oh, it's you.&quot;

Laudo, Pluto Knight IV: &quot;Should we capture him?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;No, he saved my life. You may go. I will handle this.&quot;

Laudo, Pluto Knight IV: &quot;Yes, sir!&quot;
Other Pluto Knight: &quot;Yes, sir!&quot;

[The knights run off.]

Baku: &quot;Ain't such a knucklehead anymore, huh?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Silence! This is no place for thieves! You must leave, now.&quot;

Baku: &quot;So that's how it is, huh? Do I gotta remind you that one of my
      boys saved your kingdom? But I bet you ain't got no ears for
      listenin' to a lowlife like me.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Are you talking about Zidane? Yes, he did protect the
         princess and her kingdom... But that doesn't change the fact
         that you are all thieves! I cannot let your kind roam around
         the castle!&quot;

Baku: &quot;No appreciation whatsoever, eh? Well, I ain't got any reason to
      stay here, anyway. Hey, you know where Zidane might be?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;He hasn't visited the castle since we returned. Maybe he
         can teach you a thing or two about proper manners!

Baku: &quot;Okay, I get yer point! I've had enough of your self-righteousness!

[Baku drops the letter in his momentary furor. The boat approaches.]

Baku: &quot;Gwahahaha! Perfect timing! Take me into town!&quot;

[Steiner clenches his fists and runs off. Beatrix walks into the
screen and down to where Baku and Steiner were shouting.]

Beatrix: &quot;Ah, so it was Steiner... I thought I heard him yelling.
         Sigh... Alexandria is at peace again... Yet my heart is full
         of sorrow. Why...? Hmm? Steiner must've dropped this. Let's
         see...&quot;

[She reads the letter, which says: 'When the night sky wears the moon
as its pendant, I shall await you at the dock.']

Beatrix: &quot;Wh-What is this letter!? Did Steiner... ...write me a love
         letter? Steiner...&quot;

[The scene shifts to Zidane, still moping around the Morning Star Bar.]

Zidane: &quot;Dagger... Are you all cozy on your throne already!? No! No,
        no, no! I can't start my day without Dagger! Her smile! Her
        voice! Her voice is like a beautiful song... And her song makes
        me soar high into the sky! But now...&quot;

Voice: &quot;You can still fly high, darlin'!&quot;

[Ruby and the Tantalus brothers run in.]

Ruby: &quot;Zidane, you can do it!&quot;

Cinna: &quot;She's right!&quot;

Blank: &quot;Why are you still moping? This isn't like you at all!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Yeah!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Stop it! You don't understand how I feel! Whoa!&quot;

[As Zidane headed for the exit, Baku belly-bumped in him back in.]

Baku: &quot;Long time no see, Zidane! What happened? You look pathetic.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Boss! Let me join Tantalus again! We can steal treasure
        together, just like old times!&quot;

Baku: &quot;Treasure, eh? There ain't much treasure lyin' around this
      world, boy. Besides... A Tantalus always gets what he sets his
      eyes on! That's our number one rule, remember!? Now, you don't.
      You got no right to join us. You understand what I'm sayin'? If
      you can't even capture a canary, you ain't got what it takes to
      join Tantalus!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Boss...&quot;

[Vivi walks in.]

Vivi: &quot;Hey, Zidane, can we go see Dagger?&quot;

Baku: &quot;Gwahahaha! Why can't you be more honest, like this little guy?&quot;

[Baku, Ruby, and the Tantalus boys all walk out.]

Vivi: &quot;Can we? Can we? Please?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright. Let's cheer her on before she becomes a queen!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Yeah!&quot;

[Zidane and Vivi head toward the town gondola dock. Freya is there,
talking to herself.]

Freya: &quot;That Zidane... Doesn't even stop by to say hello!&quot;

[Amarant walks by and the two start at each other in passing.]

Freya: &quot;What are you staring at?&quot;

Amarant: &quot;...Are you really that tough?&quot;

[They get in battle stances.]

Freya: &quot;Try me!&quot;

Amarant: &quot;I don't go looking for trouble, but I'll fight back if
         trouble finds me. Why don't you apologize, and maybe I'll
         forgive you.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Ha!&quot;

[The two guards at the dock see the fight starting to heat up.]

Alexandrian Guard: &quot;!&quot;
Alexandrian Guard: &quot;!&quot;

Alexandrian Guard: &quot;Stop right now or I will charge both of you with
                   disorderly conduct!&quot;

[Zidane and Vivi finally arrive.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey! What's going on here?&quot;

Freya: &quot;Zidane! I'd love to stop and talk, but I'm busy right now.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Is she...a friend of yours? Then tell her who I am. Tell
         her I'm the Flaming Amarant.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Sorry, Amarant. She's just a little worked up about something.&quot;
        [He goes over to the nearest guard.] &quot;Sorry, babe. They're my
        friends.&quot; [He goes over to the nearest guard.] &quot;Will you let
        them go for my sake?&quot;

Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;S-Sure... Princess Garnet asked us to give special
                     treatment to you, Master Vivi, and Miss Freya.&quot;

Zidane: (Dagger...) &quot;I-I see. Thanks! Hey, Freya... Stop being so mad,
        alright?&quot;

Freya: &quot;Do you know why I'm really mad? It's because of you! Where have
       you been!? Dagger is about to become queen, and you're off
       wandering about! Have you found out anything more about Kuja!?
       Well? Answer me!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Um... Well, I tried to find more info, but...&quot;

Freya: &quot;Look, if Kuja was responsible for taking Dagger's eidolons...
       ...and killing Brahne, who was working with him... Don't you
       think he'd come after Dagger again!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I know... But what can I do? I couldn't even talk to her,
        remember? I don't even know if I can protect her... Besides,
        she's gonna be queen. She'll have all the guards she'll need.
        She won't need me.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;But Zidane... I think Dagger wants to see you. So... Let's go
      see her!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah... But we'll leave as soon as we're done.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Zidane... You're not gettin' away from me. You still owe
         me a rematch.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Suit yourself.&quot;

[The gondola arrives and they take it to the castle. As they arrive
at the main hallway, Steiner walks out carrying Eiko by her angel-
-wing ornament.]

Eiko: &quot;Aaahhh! Leggo!!!&quot;

[He throws her on her bottom.]

Eiko: &quot;Ouch! This is no way to treat a lady!?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Quit screaming, or I'll throw you into the dungeon!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;GAAAHHH!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What happened, Eiko?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Zidane! Oh, it was horrible! He called me a liar and a loudmouth
      and a brat!!!&quot;

Amarant: &quot;...He's right.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;What did you just say!? Do you want to repeat that!?&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Man, I hate kids...&quot;

Freya: &quot;Calm down a little. What's your name?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Me? I'm Eiko! Eiko from Madain Sari!&quot;

Freya: &quot;Madain Sari? Why, I've never heard of it.

Eiko: &quot;Don't you know anything? Madain Sari is a--&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Silence! What are you all doing here!? This is a royal
         castle! You do not belong here!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Hello, Master Steiner.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Master Vivi! A pleasure to see you again.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;We came here to see Dagger.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;The princess? Hmm... If that is Master Vivi's wish, I shall
         arrange a meeting.&quot;

[He takes them up to the hallway near the guardhouse.]

Steiner: &quot;You all wait right there! Princess, we are ready.&quot;

[A dressed-up Dagger comes out with Beatrix.]

Garnet: &quot;Thank you for coming, everyone.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;She looks beautiful...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Wow... You look beautiful!&quot;

Freya: &quot;Splendid! Zidane? Have you nothing to say?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...No.

Steiner: &quot;Princess, we must go now.&quot;

Garnet: (Zidane...) &quot;...Alright.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Dagger, wait!&quot;

[She runs up the stairs.]

Eiko: &quot;Dagger! Is this the last time we're ever gonna see each other?&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Oh, no. Of course not. I won't be able to wander around the
        world with you anymore... ...but I'll never forget our journey
        together.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Dagger... I wanted us to remain good rivals forever.&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Rivals? Eiko, you say funny things sometimes. Oh, there are
        some things I wanted to give you. Let's trade the jewels as
        a symbol of our friendship. Two of my jewels...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Two of my jewels...&quot;

Garnet: &quot;Goodbye, Eiko.&quot;

[Beatrix, Steiner, and Garnet leave.]

Vivi: &quot;Why didn't you say anything to her, Zidane?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I don't know... I tried...&quot;

Freya: &quot;And?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I couldn't say anything! I had a whole speech ready for her.
        But it would have been a lie! How could I lie to her!? 'Good
        luck, Dagger! I'll be watching you from afar. Come find me if
        you need someone to talk to.' It's a big fat lie! That's not
        how I feel at all! That's not how I feel...at all.&quot;

[Later on, when night hits the castle, Eiko hangs around near the
empty gondola dock.]

Eiko: &quot;So, there's only room for Dagger in Zidane's heart... I wish I
      hadn't written that stupid letter. Zidane looked so sad... Isn't
      there anything I can do for him? Aaahhhhhh! Zidane!!! I hate
      you!!! You insensitive fool!!! You don't even know how I feel...
      I feel bad about ditching him, but I really don't feel like
      seeing him tonight. I gotta hide before he shows up! Shoot!
      Someone's coming! Could it be Zidane!?&quot;

[Eiko finds a hiding place; Blank and Marcus sneak around.]

Marcus: &quot;There's no one here, Bro.&quot;

Blank: &quot;I guess I'm early...&quot;

Marcus: &quot;...Maybe. I wonder who wrote you that love letter?&quot;

Blank: &quot;Well... Just read the letter. I bet she's beautiful!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Really? Are you sure you didn't write it yourself? I mean,
        you caught the letter falling from the floor above you, right?&quot;

Blank: &quot;I'm telling you, she was too shy to hand me the letter herself!
       And if you don't think I'm a ladies' man, you're wrong. Chicks
       are intimidated by good-looking guys. That's why...&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Someone coming!&quot;

Blank: &quot;Marcus! Don't interrupt me while I'm talking!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Let's hide, Bro!&quot;

Blank: &quot;Alright, alright...&quot;

[The two run to hide and Blank drops the letter in the hustle.
Steiner appears and looks around.]

Steiner: &quot;I must tighten up security around the castle from now on!
         Dusk to dawn, rain to shine, I must patrol the castle! Right,
         clear! Left, clear! Huh? It's a piece of paper... This looks
         like a letter. Let's see...&quot;

Letter: When the night sky wears the moon as its pendant, I shall
        await you at the dock.

Steiner: &quot;M-M-My goodness! Th-This is a love letter! Who wrote it to
         whom!? Hmm... No address or addressee... Did someone drop it
         here, knowing that I would pass by? Who could it have been...?&quot;

[Beatrix walks by.]

Beatrix: &quot;Steiner...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Beatrix... Was it you...?&quot;

[Eiko watches from her hiding place.]

Eiko: &lt;Thump thump...&gt; (A-Are they in love?)

[Blank and Marcus watch, too.]

Marcus: &quot;(B-Bro...)&quot;

Blank: &quot;(Shh! Quiet!)&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Steiner...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Beatrix...&quot;

Eiko: (Ooo! What's gonna happen?)

Marcus: &quot;(M-My nose is bleeding...)&quot;

Blank: &quot;(Then stick your thump up it!)&quot;

[The three hiding move to a better position to watch. Beatrix and
Steiner move in for the kiss, but--]

Voice: &quot;AAA-CHOO! AAA-CHOO!&quot;

[Baku walks into view; Beatrix ducks out of sight.]

Blank: &quot;Boss!?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Oh, you totally ruined the scene!&quot;

[Eiko walks off and the scene ends. The next day, the party hangs
around the Morning Start Bar.]

Freya: &quot;That Zidane... Where did he go?&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Who knows...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I'll go look for him...&quot;

[Eiko knocks him over as he runs out and she walks in.]

Eiko: &quot;Ahh! Hey, watch it! I'm NOT in a good mood right now! Stay
      out of my way!&quot;

[Tot walks in.]

Tot: &quot;Excuse me. Have you seen a young lady named Eiko?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Oh! It's the nerdy guy!&quot;

Tot: &quot;Ha ha ha... You're as energetic as ever.&quot;
</pre><pre id="faqspan-9">
Eiko: &quot;Yup! I'm always energetic! (But I'm really hurting on the
      inside from being rejected by Zidane...)&quot;

Tot: &quot;Did you say something?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;No, I didn't! Didn't you come here to talk to me about something?&quot;

Tot: &quot;Oh, yes. I almost forgot... Your village... What was the name...?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Madain Sari.&quot;

Tot: &quot;Yes, I wanted to ask you a few questions about Madain Sari.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Sure, I'll tell you everything I know. You helped me out. But
      why don't we go to your place? We can relax there.&quot;

Tot: &quot;To my home? My home is located in Treno. It's a bit far from
     here...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Treno? Sounds like a cool place! I'm really interested in
      sightseeing! I wanna go there.&quot;

Voice: &quot;I'm coming with you!&quot;

[Zidane walks in.]

Zidane: &quot;There's a card game tournament going on in Treno right now.
        I wanna participate.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;A card game tournament? That sounds fun. I wanna go, too...&quot;

Freya: &quot;I'd like to go, as well.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Treno, huh...?&quot;

Tot: &quot;Ha ha ha... Quite a party this is becoming. It would be my
     pleasure. We shall all go to Treno.&quot;

[They all go down to the Alexandria gargant station.]

Zidane: &quot;There's still Mist here...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Kinds looks like the Iifa Tree before we got rid of the Mist.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I don't think the Mist is as dense as it was before.&quot;

Tot: &quot;Yes, I heard that you all stopped the Mist... The Mist permeated
     through the roots. That is probably why it still lingers here.&quot;

[The gargant comes around.]

Freya: &quot;...This is a gargant?&quot;

Tot: &quot;Yes. Shall we?&quot;

[The ATE 'Clowns on a Dark Night' plays. When it finishes, the party
has already arrived in Tot's abode.]

===========================================================
34. Dark City Treno (TR02)
===========================================================

Amarant: &quot;I never know about this secret passage...&quot;

Tot: &quot;I apologize for the lack of space.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;It's fine...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, Amarant, have you been here before?&quot;

Amarant: &quot;...What about you?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Me? I've been to every place where there are beautiful women!&quot;

Amarant: &quot;......&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Can we talk about Madain Sari later? I wanna go sightseeing.&quot;

Tot: &quot;Oh, of course. There's no hurry.

Eiko: &quot;What are you staring at? Let's go!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Wh-Who? Me?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Yes, you! This is my first time in Treno. Show me around.&quot;

[The two go off.]

Freya: &quot;Then I shall go, as well. I'll take this chance to relax.&quot;

[She leaves.]

Zidane: &quot;What about you, Amarant?&quot;

Amarant: &quot;......&quot;

[He walks off.]

Zidane: &quot;...I don't understand him.&quot;

Tot: &quot;You know, today is the last day for the card game tournament
     registration.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Well, then I better go register.&quot;

Tot: &quot;I'm a skilled card player. Let me know if you need assistance.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, I'm not so out of practice that I'd need your help.&quot;

Tot: &quot;I see. Good luck.&quot;

[Zidane goes down to the stadium.]

Card Seller: &quot;Registration for the card tournament is still open. You
             must win two games before you can challenge the champion.
             Fantastic prizes await the contestant who defeats the
             champion.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What's the champion like?&quot;

Card Seller: &quot;Lo and behold...!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Is he that amazing?&quot;

Card Seller: &quot;Oh, yes, very much so...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Just tell me what he's like!&quot;

Card Seller: &quot;Well...&quot; &lt;Whisper whisper...&gt;

Zidane: &quot;Wh-What!? She's a cutie in a sailor's uniform!? Wow, I'd
        love to challenge her!&quot;

Card Seller: &quot;See? Now, go ahead and register!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Sure, I'll register. Anything to meet this girl!&quot;

Card Seller: &quot;You're registered now. Please enter through the gate.
             The game will begin automatically.&quot;

[Zidane goes in to play. The contestants are announced in this
format:]

Card Game Tourament
    _____ Round
Opponent: ___________

[Zidane can play:]

R1 - Attic Man Wake
R2 - Cardona Bishop
R3 - Sailor Erin

[After entering to play the last round, Erin (the girl Zidane can
talk to in Lindblum Castle) and Regent Cid come alone.]

Erin: &quot;This way, Regent!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Yes, I know... But remember my condition...&quot;

Erin: &quot;Please, Regent! You must behave like a champion! Let's
      register!&quot;

Boy: &quot;It's the champion!&quot;
Father: &quot;Yeah, here she comes...

Erin: &quot;I'm the champion, Erin! I'd like to enter the tournament, please!&quot;

Card Seller: &quot;Ah, we've been waiting for you! Please go inside.&quot;

Erin: &quot;Thanks. Hey...&quot;

Boy: &quot;Ewww, Dad, it's an oglop!&quot;

Father: &quot;Shoo! Shoo! Go away you filthy oglop!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;......&quot;

Erin: &quot;Um... I'm sorry, but this oglop is my...&quot;

Boy: &quot;It's the champion's pet?&quot;

Father: &quot;I-I'm sorry!&quot;

Erin: &quot;It's okay...&quot;

[The two start walking inside the arena.]

Regent Cid: &quot;Since when am I your pet!? &lt;Gwok!&gt;&quot;

Erin: &quot;Well, you ARE an oglop right now, after all...&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Silence! &lt;Gwok!&gt; I'm the champion! &lt;Gwok-gwok...&gt; No
            one understands...&quot;

[They enter.]

Father: &quot;I heard the champion is a master of winning games with
        oglop cards... Her name is... 'Erin the Oglop Master'...&quot;

[After the game:]

Card Game Usher: &quot;Congratulations, you're the winner!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wow, I didn't know you were the champ, Erin.&quot;

Erin: &quot;Long time no see, Mr. Zidane!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Don't be ridiculous! I'm the champion!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, Regent Cid. Still an oglop, I see.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;And you still haven't learn any manners...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Cut me some slack, will ya? What are you doing here, anyway?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Mainly participating in the tournament, but there was
            something I wanted to test.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What are you testing?&quot;

Erin: &quot;Our new airship, Hilda Garde 2!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;The one that can fly without Mist?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Correct. We can't go very fast yet, but we made it to Treno.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Why now?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;I have a funny feeling there'll be more trouble on the
            horizon.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Don't you worry. I'm sure our almighty Queen Garnet will take
        care of everything.&quot;

[Eiko and Mog run over.]

Eiko: &quot;Oh no! This is horrible!!!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What's up, Eiko?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Oh, it's horrible! A moogle from Treno just told me--&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;What's wrong? &lt;Gwok!&gt;&quot;

Eiko: &quot;It's Alexandria! Something horrible is happening!&quot;

===========================================================
35. Alexandria Castle &amp; The Town (AC05)
===========================================================

[A scene happens in the vacant entrance plaza to Alexandria. Someone
stands behind a statue and speaks.]

Voice: &quot;Peace is but a shadow of death
       Desperate to forget its painful past...
       Though we hope for promising years
       After shedding a thousand tears,
       Yesterday's sorrow constantly nears.
       An while the moon still shines blue,
       By dawn, it will turn to scarlet hue.&quot;

[Kuja walks out from behind the statue.]

Kuja: &quot;What an auspicious day for Alexandria. Garnet's ascension to
      the throne has brought hope and peace to this kingdom. The
      people are overjoyed; they believe a wonderful future is ahead
      of them. ...But the celebration isn't over yet. It's time to
      really light things up! Your former master is here, Bahamut.
      Play a requiem for her and all of Alexandria!&quot;

[FMV. Bahamut rips through the clouds and starts blowing fireballs at
the houses nearby. Garnet sees the destruction happening and Bahamut
floats in the fire. Afterwards, a boy runs by the Morning Star Bar.]

Boy: &quot;This way! Hurry!&quot;

Girl: &quot;I don't wanna die!&quot;

[The local villagers all start heading towards the town entrance. Up
at the throne room, Beatrix runs to Dagger.]

Beatrix: &quot;Your Highness!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;That's Bahamut, isn't it...? Beatrix, please gather the
        soldiers.&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Yes, Your Highness! Our soldiers have already assembled and
         await your orders.&quot;

[At the main stairway, Steiner yells at his ramshackle crew.]

Steiner: &quot;HURRY UP, YOU FOOLS! This is an emergency! Get your act
         together before the princess arrives! Line up!!!&quot;

[Dagger and Beatrix walks to the balcony.]

Beatrix: &quot;Your Highness, as you can see, we are ready to act at any
         time. Please give your orders.&quot;

Narrative: Your orders?
           R1 --&gt; Gather information
           R2 --&gt; Protect the townspeople
           R3 --&gt; Contact Lindblum and request reinforcements
           R4 --&gt; Begin preparations to fire the cannons

[Zidane picks one of the options, then pairs it with these groups
of Pluto Knights:]

-Weimar &amp; Haagen
-Breireicht &amp; Laudo
-Blutzen &amp; Kohel
-Dojebon &amp; Mullenkedheim

[After they're picked and run off, Beatrix will say, from worst
to best:]

Beatrix: &quot;Trust your powers, Your Highness. I know you will succeed...&quot;
Beatrix: &quot;Well done, Your Highness.&quot;
Beatrix: &quot;You were splendid, Your Highness.&quot;

[Receive: Hi-Potion , Elixir, or Angel Earrings, respectfully.]

Steiner: &quot;Beatrix, let's go!&quot;

[They run off to fight.]

Dagger: &quot;...Everyone's gone. I don't know what to do... Mother...I
        need your help.&quot;

[A strange energy flows around her pendant(s) and she collapses. In
the town, Beatrix and Steiner arrive to find Mistodons wreaking havoc
in the square.]

Steiner: &quot;This is it, Beatrix.&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;I will give my all for Alexandria!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Well said! Let us march on to victory!

[They slay the nearest monster and run into the next screen.]

Steiner: &quot;Beware, Beatrix! The enemy is close!&quot;

[A mistodon jumps off a roof and attacks...and dies. They head to
the bar front and find another.]

Steiner: &quot;You wish to fight us!? You despicable beast!&quot;

[Another attacks from behind in a pincer.]

Beatrix: &quot;For Her Highness!&quot;
Steiner: &quot;For the princess!&quot;

[They slay them both together, finding another one soon.]

Steiner: &quot;Prepare to die!&quot;

[They kill it.]

Steiner: &quot;Beatrix, are you alright?&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;I'm fine. What about you? You're wounded!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;It's just a scratch.&quot;

[A monster attacks.]

Steiner: &quot;Persistent bastards!&quot;

[They kill it like the rest.]

Beatrix: &quot;This is futile! Let us return to the castle!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;No! I cannot face the princess until we destroy all these
         beasts. On my honor, I vow to protect the princess, the
         citizens of Alexandria, and... Beatrix! I...I shall protect
         you!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Steiner...&quot;

[A Mistodon nears.]

Steiner: &quot;Watch out!

[They make it go the way of the Mist.]

Steiner: &quot;...This might be it for us!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;I have no regrets!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Beatrix...there is something I must tell you!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;What is it?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I...&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Save your valediction, Steiner. We'll live to see another day.&quot;

[They defeat the monsters, and the view switches to Garnet, who is
just coming back into consciousness on the stair.]

Dagger: &quot;...? I hear music... Where is it coming from...? Is it
        coming from upstairs...?&quot;

[She runs upstairs to the castle roof. FMV. The castle builds itself
up around the large sword in the center, and a stairway platform rises
up for access. At the top:]

Dagger: &quot;What is this place...? I can still hear the music. Where is
        it coming from...? ...What am I doing here...? Mother...
        Zidane... No... I can't depend on them anymore! As the queen
        of Alexandria, I must protect my kingdom.&quot;

[Up in the sky, the party heads to Alexandria on the Hilda Garde 2.]

Freya: &quot;The ship is rocking pretty bad.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;It can't be helped. I designed this ship as an oglop,
            after all. So, I have no &lt;gwok&gt; idea what could happen.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Sounds like it might crash at any minute.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Perhaps... But I think we can at least make it to
            Alexandria.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh, man... I guess we'd better cross our fingers.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Zidane... ...I'm starting to feel sick...&quot;

Amarant: &quot;It's probably from the flight. Go inside and get some rest.
         Try to stay in the middle of the ship. You'll feel less
         movement.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Go on, Vivi.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Okay... Thanks...&quot;

[Vivi sees Eiko's pendant start to gather energy.]

Vivi: &quot;Eiko?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;What?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I saw something sparkle.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Huh?&quot;

[The burst of energy from the pendant knocks most everybody down.]

Eiko: &quot;Dagger...?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dagger!? Eiko, what's going on?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;I thought I just heard Dagger's voice.&quot;

[The ship rocks furiously again.]

Zidane: &quot;What? Geez, something's wrong with this ship...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;This light... Maybe it's the holy judgment!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Holy judgment? Hey, what are you doing!?&quot;

[Eiko stands on the ship's jutting bow.]

Eiko: &quot;The summoner is being called... Alexander's judgment has come!&quot;

[She jumps off the ship's bow. FMV. Eiko flies through the air and
heads straight for Dagger. Both pendants glow and Eiko lands safely
as a bright light comes from the palace.]

Dagger: &quot;Eiko! How--why are you here!?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;I heard your voice on the airship.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;No wonder... I felt your presence, too, and all of a sudden,
        I was covered in light. It's happening again!&quot;

[Both pendants start to gather energy again.]

Eiko: &quot;Dagger, this is the light of destiny.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;The light of destiny?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;A summoner's light of destiny, brought on by the hidden powers
      of the 4 jewels. This light appears when a holy eidolon calls
      for its summoner. Come on, Dagger! As summoners, we have to
      fulfill our destiny!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;But... I don't know what to do.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;It's okay. I'll show you. First, we have to put our hands
      together.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Like this?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Uh-huh. Now pray in your heart.&quot;

Narrative?: O holy guardian, hear our prayers. Darkness overshadows us
            once again. O holy guardian, hear our prayers. Deliver us
            out of darkness into light.&quot;

[The girls start to glow. FMV. A bright pillar of light shines on the
castle as two large angel's wings wrap around the castle entire. The
dragon king shoots fireballs at it, but Alexander shrugs them off with
ease. He then sends streams of light after Bahamut, which entangles
and disappears him(!?). Kuja stands in the square, watching.]

Kuja: &quot;It's so beautiful... Alexander...the legendary eidolon... So,
      you wish to defend the castle with your brilliant wings...? How
      admirable... Your powers even transcend Bahamut's... Alexander,
      I've been waiting for you. I've called a magic carriage for you.
      I'm sure you'll like it. Invincible, come forth! You're mine,
      Alexander!&quot;

[FMV. The giant eye in the sky opens up above Alexander. In the pilot
seat, an unfamiliar man stands back turned.]

Man: &quot;You have gone too far, Kuja. I granted you the freedom to do as
     you wish in Gaia for one purpose alone. Now that you have lost
     sight of your mission, I will no longer tolerate your actions.
     You have not the slightest idea whom you are defying. I will show
     you soon enough. You too, Zidane...&quot;

[The man gathers energy and the eye starts to glow. Below, Kuja stares
up, mystified.]

Kuja: &quot;!!!? What happened to the Invincible!? Enslave Alexander, as
      you enslaved Bahamut! !!! Could it be...Garland!? Impossible!
      Why would he come to Gaia!? If it is indeed Garland, he must
      know my plan! But why has he assumed control of the Invincible...?
      !!!? No! He can't be...&quot;

[In the castle, the party finally arrives.]

Regent Cid: &quot;Phew... That was quite a trip...&quot;

Amarant: &quot;You little bug. We could've been killed.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Amarant's right. It was a mistake to come here on that airship.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Well, we had to get here somehow.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Come on, guys. We made it here in one piece. That's all that
        matters.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;&lt;Gwok-gwok!&gt; That's right!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I'm never gonna ride on an airship again... Never ever...&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Sorry, Vivi.&quot;

[A Pluto Knight runs in.]

Haagen, Pluto Knight VIII: &quot;Captain!!! Where is Her Highness!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I don't know. We're looking for her, too.&quot;

Haagen, Pluto Knight VIII: &quot;Shoot! I must find the captain!&quot;

[Haagen runs off.]

Zidane: &quot;Alright, let's go find Dagger.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;We have to find Eiko, too.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;They're probably together.&quot;

[They go up the same way Dagger took, to the roof.]

Vivi: &quot;Gee... What is this?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;&lt;Gwok!&gt; So, this is the secret of Alexandria Castle...&quot;

Freya: &quot;Are Dagger and Eiko up there?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Maybe. Let's go see.&quot;

[Zidane runs up.]

Regent Cid: &quot;&lt;GWOK!&gt; What are you doing!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;There's no point in us all going. I'll take it from here.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Wh-Why? I wanna go with you. I wanna help Dagger and Eiko, too.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Kuja might destroy this castle at any minute. Get out of here
        while you can. Go on, Vivi. Don't worry about me. Someday,
        you'll probably do the same thing for someone who's really
        important to you. Dagger is more important to me than anything
        else.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Man, you make me sick. I'm outta here. Next time you wanna
         play hero, don't even bother calling me. Later...&quot;

[Amarant bails.]

Freya: &quot;I guess here's no way to stop you. But remember, this is not
       just your war, so don't even think about fighting Kuja now. As
       soon as you find Dagger, leave.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Come on, Vivi. Let's go.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Freya. Wait.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Let him go, Vivi. He'll be alright.&quot;

[Freya and Regent Cid leave.]

Zidane: &quot;Sorry I can't take you with me. But I have to go with my
        instincts on this one. I don't know what else to say...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Okay, Zidane... Good luck.&quot;

[Vivi leaves; Zidane heads up. The castle shakes as he runs, though.]

Zidane: &quot;Whooooa! What the heck was that!? GEEZ!&quot;

[It starts shaking again. FMV. The Invincible's &quot;eye&quot; shoots a large
beam down at Alexander, disintegrating it. A piece of the castle falls
and Dagger almost becomes squashed tomatoes...but Zidane jumps with a
banner cord in hand and rescues her, earning a warm hug from his trouble.
Eiko scowls, naturally. Back up where it's safe:]

Zidane: &quot;Dagger... I'm sorry... I don't know why I wasn't honest with
        you...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Zidane... We really made a big mess, didn't we?&quot;

[A tremor shakes the castle again.]

Zidane: &quot;We'll talk later! Let's get out of here!

[FMV. The Invincible fires a beam and the castle starts to explode,
with a devastating shockwave ripping through all sections of the
town... Up in the Invincible, Garland watches.]

Garland: &quot;More souls have returned... In microscopic proportions, the
         process still continues after thousands of years. Eventually,
         these circulating souls will no longer belong to Gaia. They
         must never be circulated back... Kuja did well. If only he
         had lasted longer... I never imagined he would choose to end
         his remaining days on Gaia... Perhaps, this was his fate, set
         in ages past. I, too, cannot escape my fate; someday, I must
         face your counterpart...&quot;

[He walks away. When the screen comes back into view, it's Lindblum.]

===========================================================
36. Lindblum (LB03)
===========================================================

[Artania and the Regent walk through the Business District.]

Minister Artania: &quot;As you can see, the reconstruction is moving right
                  along.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Good. We've started building airship No. 3. It's going
            well, too &lt;gwok&gt;. Many engineers from the Industrial
            District have volunteered. Our people are so strong. I
            never realized it until now...&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;They have faith in you, Regent. That is why they
                  can be strong. They are proud to be citizens of
                  Lindblum.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;......&quot;

Voice: &quot;AAH...ACHOOO!!!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Baku?&quot;

[Baku and Blank walk over.]

Baku: &quot;Hey, Regent. What's goin' on?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;I'm tired from working day and night on a new airship...
            Hey, why don't you come by the research center and give us
            a hand sometime?&quot;

Baku: &quot;......&quot;
Blank: &quot;......&quot;

Baku: &quot;You talkin' to both of us?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Heh, heh, heh. I'm just kidding. We already have enough
            people &lt;gwok&gt; working on it.&quot;

Baku: &quot;Oh... Do you know how Zidane's doing?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;He's fine. In fact, he's probably awake now.&quot;

Baku: &quot;Blank, go to the castle and see how he's doing.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Oh, and tell him to come to my room.&quot;

[Blank shrugs and walks off. In the castle guest room, Zidane wakes.]

Zidane: &quot;Dagger... Eiko... ...How did I get here?

Blank: &quot;Zidane.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;!?&quot;

[Blank runs in.]

Blank: &quot;So, how are you feelin'?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Okay, I guess... By the way...&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Where's Dagger?
        R2 --&gt; How did I get here?

        R1: &quot;Do you know where Dagger is?&quot;

            Blank: &quot;No, I haven't seen her. Maybe she's upstairs by
                   the telescope.&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;Oh yeah!&quot;

            Blank: &quot;Man, isn't there anything on his mind besides
                   girls...?&quot;

        R2: &quot;So what happened after that? How did I get here?&quot;

            Blank: &quot;Slow down. Geez... Things were so chaotic; it took
                   forever to find you guys. No one really got hurt
                   except you. I heard you pulled some crazy stunt.&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;Yeah... Eiko and Dagger were in trouble, so...&quot;

            Blank: &quot;Always showing off. You got hurt pretty bad
                   because of that. After we found you guys, we stole
                   a ship by the port and escaped.&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;Wow. I don't remember any of that.&quot;

            Blank: &quot;I didn't think so. You know, you slept three days
                   straight...&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;Really!?&quot;

            Blank: &quot;By the way, Cid said he wanted to talk to you in
                   the royal chamber.&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;Oh. Okay. I wonder what he wants...&quot;

[Zidane runs off. If you asked where Garnet was, you can go up and see
Garnet near the rooftop telescope:]

Zidane: &quot;Well, look who's here. Man, we went through some crazy stuff,
        huh? I honesty didn't think I was gonna make it this time. But
        as you can see, I'm alright now.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dagger... Is something wrong?&quot;

[Dagger shakes her head.]

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Ohhh, okay. You're so happy to see me, you don't know what to
        say. I didn't know you loved me so much.&quot; (Did I do something
        wrong...?) &quot;Alright, what did I do wrong?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: (...Maybe she's just tired. A lot has happened since Brahne's
        death... ...I'd better cheer her up.) &quot;Hey, remember that
        promise we made before the festival? You still owe me a date.
        Come on. Let's go.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: (...I think she's starting to get annoyed. Maybe I should
        leave her alone.) &quot;I guess you have a lot on your mind right
        now. Sorry to bother you. I'll see you later.&quot;

[Zidane runs off.]

Dagger: (Zidane... You're so sweet. Thank you.)

[If you asked Blank where Garnet was and saw her up at the telescope,
you can see the ATE 'My Bad' and Blank will be in the elevator hall,
and will say when you come back down:]

Blank: &quot;About time. Yo!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What, are you following me or something?&quot;

Blank: &quot;Hey, I don't have time to play around, like you. I forgot to
       tell you something earlier.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, what?&quot;

Blank: &quot;Sheez... What's with you?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;?&quot;

Blank: &quot;Ohhh... You had a fight with her, huh?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Shut up! None of your damn business!&quot;

Blank: &quot;Heh-heh-heh. Take it easy. Cid said he wants to see you. He's
       in the royal chamber.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What does he want?&quot;

Blank: &quot;I don't know.&quot;

[He leaves. Zidane heads for the royal chamber.]

Regent Cid: &quot;&lt;Gwok!&gt; At last, the hero has awakened.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I heard you wanted to see me. What's up?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;After reviewing the attack on Alexandria, we discovered
            some interesting facts... ...facts, I think, you all
            should know &lt;gwok&gt;.&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;The others are waiting in the conference room. We
                  can begin the meeting at any time.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Alright, let's begin.&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;Please, follow me.&quot;

[The two walk into the downstairs dining room; the throne plummets
on mechanic arms down, too.]

Freya: &quot;!!!&quot;
Steiner: &quot;!!!&quot;
Vivi: &quot;!!!&quot;
Eiko: &quot;!!!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Is that everyone?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;We are still missing the princess.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...She's probably upstairs, by the telescope.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;I'll go get her.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wait! ...Oh well.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Let's begin. Where should I start...?&quot;

[The ATE 'Self-reproach' plays. Afterwards...]

Steiner: &quot;...The town is now in shambles. Many innocent lives were
         lost.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;&lt;Gwok&gt; ...I can imagine.&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;Her Highness is probably beyond despair.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I have never witnessed such tragedy. There was nothing we
         could do. We fought with everything we had, but to no avail.
         Beatrix and I were prepared to give our lives. ...I don't
         know what happened to her.&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;We have spent much time and effort rebuilding
                  Lindblum. But I believe it will take much longer
                  for our people to overcome their losses. Those who
                  survived have a long, tough road ahead of them.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Burmecia, Cleyra, Lindblum and now Alexandria... Kuja has
       vanquished all four nations. What is he trying to accomplish?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Who knows!? Let's just go get him!&quot;

Amarant: &quot;It's not that easy. Kuja's powers are beyond ours. How do
         you plan to fight him?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;......&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Kuja is a man of many mysteries, indeed. I still can't
            believe what I saw when we were evacuating from Alexandria.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What!? What did you see?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;I saw him escape on my stolen airship, Hilda Garde 1
            &lt;gwok&gt;. There were black mages onboard, too.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;!!!&quot;
Zidane: &quot;!!!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;They weren't any old black mages! They were talking
            normally!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;NO!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;No way... Are you sure about this?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;There's no doubt.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;WHY!? Why are they with Kuja...?&quot;

[The ATE 'Deep Anger' plays. Afterwards...]

Zidane: &quot;...So basically, your wife got mad at you and used her magic
        to turn you into an oglop.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Sad sotry, isn't it? My lecherous character has led to
            my undoing.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;But how did Kuja get a hold of Lady Hilda's airship?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;&lt;Gwok!&gt; That's what I'd like to know. He probably
            commandeered it to further his mad schemes, whatever they
            may be. In any case, I must get Hilda and her airship back
            somehow &lt;gwok&gt;!&quot;

Freya: &quot;What a shame, for a ruler to end up like this... But we can't
       ignore this situation. Kuja must be stopped!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Indeed! We must deal with him before it is too late!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It's easier said than done. We don't know where he is. We
        don't even have an airship to look for him.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;He's right. No. 2 is still &lt;gwok&gt; out of commission. And
            I doubt I can oversee the construction of a new airship in
            my current form. If only I were &lt;gwok&gt; a man again...
            Artania, is there anything that can be done?&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;I have spoken to Doctor Tot regarding this matter
                  and asked him to join us. He should be here any
                  minute.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;That's wonderful! I'm certain Doctor Tot will be most helpful!&quot;

[Tot walks in.]

Tot: &quot;I'm sorry I'm late.&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;Please forgive me for calling you on such short
                  notice, Doctor. Thank you very much for giving up
                  your precious time to come here.&quot;

Tot: &quot;Please, Minister. You need not be so formal. I heard what happened
     in Alexandria. I am so relieved to see you all again. Hmm? Where is
     the princess? Eiko is missing, too. !!!? Are they alright!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Don't worry, Doc. They're alright. Eiko's out looking for Dagger
        right now.&quot;

Tot: &quot;Oh, I see. Well, that's a relief.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;So, Doctor Tot, I was wondering--&quot;

[Eiko runs in.]

Eiko: &quot;HEY, GUYS!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Geez, what's up?&quot;

Tot: &quot;Ho-ho-ho. I see you are as energetic as ever.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;It's Dagger. She's...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What!? What's wrong!?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;...I think she's lost her voice. She can't talk anymore.&quot;

Tot: &quot;!!!?&quot;
Vivi: &quot;!!!&quot;
Zidane: &quot;What!?&quot;
Steiner: &quot;WHAT!!!?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Just come with me! She's in the guest room.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wait! Hold on!&quot;

[Eiko runs off.]

Zidane: &quot;I'll be back in a minute! Come on, Doc!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I'm coming, too!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Let's postpone this meeting.&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;I agree, sire... We will resume this meeting later.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Zidane, report back to me after you find out more about
            her condition.&quot;

[They go to the guest room.]

Tot: &quot;Please wait! &lt;Huff-Huff-Heave-Heave.&gt;&quot;

Eiko: &quot;She's sitting on her bed.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Dagger?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Tot: &quot;Princess?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess, what is the matter...?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;This is a bad joke. Doctor, isn't there anything you can do?&quot;

Tot: &quot;What tragedy... The princess has indeed lost her voice. After
     all that she has gone through--the death of her mother, the
     destruction of her beloved kingdom... She has suffered so much
     pain.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;P-Princess...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Dagger...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So that's it!? There's no hope!?&quot;

Tot: &quot;I believe this is only temporary. But it may be months, even
     years before she can speak again... ...until she can overcome her
     grief.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So, all we can do is wait.&quot;

Tot: &quot;I'm afraid so... This is no ordinary illness. We must keep her
     heart at peace. That is all I can think of.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;......&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess, please forgive me!!!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Eiko, can you look after her for awhile?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;...Sure. What are you gonna do?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Find Kuja and beat the crap out of him! Doc, I need an airship
        to find Kuja. Tell me how to turn Cid back into a human! That's
        the only way!&quot;

Tot: &quot;Now, now. Calm down... Let's go see the regent.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Come on, Rusty. Get up.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess, &lt;sniffle-sniffle!&gt; Please... Say something!
         &lt;sniffle-sniffle!&gt;&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You're gonna have to baby-sit him, too...&quot;

[Zidane goes up to the royal chamber, where Tot inspects the regent.]

Tot: &quot;......&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;So... &lt;gwok&gt; is there any hope for me?&quot;

Tot: &quot;...I'm sorry, sire. We must find the person who cast the spell
     to reverse the effect.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dammit...&quot;

Tot: &quot;...Actually, there may be another way. Long ago, I read a book
     on metamorphosis that discussed methods to reverse the effect.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Is this true!?&quot;

Tot: &quot;Yes. However, I don't know if it is a reliable source. The book
     had a rather comical tone.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Is there a chance that I could die from it?&quot;

Tot: &quot;I doubt it would be lethal, sire. We will simply mix three
     ingredients and apply the formula to your body.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Let's just try it.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;&lt;Gwok!&gt; That's easy for you to say.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What are the three ingredients?&quot;

Tot: &quot;Unusual Potion, Beautiful Potion, and Strange Potion. They must
     be mixed in a 5:2:3 ratio.&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;Oh... Magicians of early times often used those
                  potions. They were all fairly common in the old
                  times.&quot;

Tot: &quot;Yes. I expected the ingredients to such a powerful cure to be
     more exotic, too. But as you mentioned, they are no longer
     popular, so I do not know if we can find them.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...I think Cinna has the Unusual Potion. I'll take care of
        this. I'm gonna go downtown and look for the ingredients.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;I'm counting on you &lt;gwok&gt;.&quot;

[Zidane wanders around and finds the Beautiful Potion in the Business
District and the Strange Potion in an artist's studio. He wanders down
to the hideout to find Cinna.]

Zidane: &quot;I thought you'd all be here.&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Zidane! Are you alright!?&quot;

Cinna: &quot;I heard you got injured pretty bad!&quot;

Zenero: &quot;You can walk. That's a good sign.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, looks like I'll live.&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Have you talked to Blank?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, I saw him at the castle.&quot;

Cinna: &quot;So what are you doing here? Just stopping by to say hi?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Actually, I came here for a favor. Do you happen to have the
        Unusual Potion?&quot;

Cinna: &quot;Yeah.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Nice! Can I borrow it?&quot;

Cinna: &quot;Yeah, sure. Hold on.&quot;

[Cinna goes inside.]

Marcus: &quot;So, Zidane, are you ever going to rejoin us?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I don't know... I'm gonna think about it after things settle
        down.&quot;

Zenero: &quot;It's boring without you.&quot;

[Cinna returns.]

Cinna: &quot;Here you go.&quot; [Receive: Unusual Potion]

[If that's the last potion he has to find:]

Zidane: (That's all of 'em. Finally, I can get back to the castle and
        see Cid.)

Cinna: &quot;What are you gonna use it for?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;To turn Cid back into a human.&quot;

Marcus: &quot;???&quot;
Cinna: &quot;???&quot;
Zenero: &quot;???&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Thanks a lot!&quot;

[Zidane runs back to the royal chamber.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, I got 'em! I mixed the 3 potions in this bottle, like
        you told me to.&quot;

Tot: &quot;Excellent. Let's test it right away. Sire, are you ready?&quot;

Regent: &quot;...Oh, what the hell. Go ahead.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;This better work.&quot;

Tot: &quot;Alright. Here we go.&quot;

[Tot pours the potion on the regent and he begins to change into
many different forms.]

Zidane: &quot;Whoa!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Did it work!? ...Hmmm? Something's wrong &lt;ribbit&gt;.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Ribbit?&quot;

Tot: &quot;...... It didn't work.&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;Good gracious! The regent has become a frog!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh, man... Now we'll never get a new airship.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;That's it &lt;ribbit&gt;!!! No more potions, no more medicine!
            We're gonna go find Hilda! Gather everyone in the conference
            room! &lt;Ribbit!&gt;&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Geez. This sucks...&quot;

[Everyone is soon gathered in the meeting room.]

Minister Artania: &quot;Thank you for coming. The regent has an important
                  announcement.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;!!!? Now he's a frog!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;I wanted to &lt;ribbit&gt; become a man again, but this is all
            I got. We all know that Kuja holds the key to our fate
            &lt;ribbit&gt;. We must find him at any cost!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;But we don't have an airship!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;We can use that &lt;ribbit&gt; ship we stole in Alexandria.
            Artania, order Zebolt to service that ship immediately.&quot;

Minister Artania: &quot;Yes, sire.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So, where exactly are we going?&quot;

[Artania leaves.]

Regent Cid: &quot;&lt;Ribbit&gt;... I'm still working on that.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...Um, you said earlier that there were black mages on Kuja's
      airship. So if we go to the Black Mage Village, maybe we can
      learn something.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Hmmm...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...I still can't believe it. Why were they on Kuja's ship!? WHY!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Well, I'm with Vivi. I think we should go to the Black Mage
        Village.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Yes. Brilliant idea, Master Vivi. Princess...will you be
         going as well?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Of course she will!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I don't know if that's a good idea.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Don't worry. I'll take care of her.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Alright then! &lt;Ribbit!&gt; Let's go to the Black Mage Village!
            We'll all meet onboard the ship at the harbor in the Base
            Level.&quot;

[Zidane gets on the ship docked at Serpent's Gate.]

Zidane: &quot;Man... I hope this thing can get us there.&quot;

Voice: &quot;Finally, I found you!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;?&quot;

[Quina's on the ship.]

Zidane: &quot;Quina! What are you doing here?&quot;

Quina: &quot;Where you go, Zidane!? I travel everywhere, look all over for you!&quot;

Blank: &quot;Who's this? Your new girlfriend? Heh-heh-heh.&quot;

Quina: &quot;I so tired. From Madain Sari, I climb mountains, cross ocean,
       fight monsters...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wow. You've been through one hell of a trip. So, Blank, you're
        coming, too?&quot;

Blank: &quot;Yeah, I was asked to.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;By whom?&quot;

Blank: &quot;The boss, of course. But it wasn't his idea.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;It was mine &lt;ribbit&gt;.&quot;
Quina: &quot;!?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;We need at least one person to look after the ship when
            we reach our destination.&quot;

Blank: &quot;Plus, I still owe you guys one, so I volunteered.&quot;
Quina: &quot;F-Frog...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...You don't owe us anything.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Okay, anchors aweigh!&quot;
Quina: &quot;Is talking...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey. Quina loves frogs, so you'd better watch out.&quot;

Quina: &quot;Maybe I eat it...?&quot;
Regent Cid: &quot;I'm not worried. I've had more enemies as an oglop.
            &lt;Ribbit!&gt; Oh, by the way, if you ever want to change your
            party members, talk to me.&quot;

Blank: &quot;Okay, where are we off to?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We're going to the Black Mage Village on the Outer Continent.&quot;

Blank: &quot;Alright. Press [SELECT] whenever you wanna verify your location!&quot;

===========================================================
37. Black Mage Village (BM02)
===========================================================

[The party runs in.]

Vivi: &quot;...Looks like nobody's here.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Where did they go?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I'm gonna go look around.&quot;

[Zidane finds Vivi talking to the last (?) black mage in the village,
at the cemetery. It's Mr. 288, of course.]

Vivi: &quot;Where is everyone!?&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;They went away with Kuja... Two other guys stayed
                    behind. They're probably at the chocobo shack.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Why!? Why did they go with him!?&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;They learned about our lifespan... We can only
                    live for a given amount of time. Kuja said he knew
                    how to extend our life spans, so everyone followed
                    him...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;He's lying! I bet he's lying! Look what he's done to us. He's
      been using us, treating us like puppets.&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;...Maybe we are just puppets, created to serve
                    humans.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Come on. That's nonsense.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...Where did they go?&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;...I can't tell you that. I can't betray them.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Then why didn't you go with them?&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;......&quot;

Vivi: &quot;You said the two other guys are in the chocobo shack, right?&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;......&quot;

[Vivi runs off.]

Zidane: &quot;Vivi!&quot;

[Zidane finds him at the stable door.]

Vivi: &quot;Hello. Is anyone there?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Vivi...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Please! Open the door!&quot;

[A 'kweh' is heard.]

Zidane: &quot;?&quot;

[The door opens.]

Black Mage: &quot;It's born!!!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;!?&quot;

Black Mage: &quot;Oh...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Wait!&quot;

[Inside, the mages look at a baby chocobo.]

Black Mage No. 111: &quot;Finally...&quot;

Black Mage No. 33: &quot;Finally...&quot;

Black Mage No. 111: &quot;Hurray!!!&quot;

Black Mage No. 33: &quot;Hurray!!!&quot;

Black Mage No. 111: &quot;I still can't believe it...&quot;

Black Mage No. 33: &quot;Yeah...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I don't understand. Why are you here?&quot;

Black Mage No. 33: &quot;We're here to look after the chocobo.&quot;

Black Mage No. 111: &quot;At first, we were gonna go with everyone, but
                    someone had to stay behind to look after the
                    chocobo egg, so we stayed.&quot;

Black Mage No. 33; &quot;We kept the egg nice and warm by ptuting a lot of
                   hay over it.&quot;

Black Mage No. 111: &quot;I can't wait to show him to everyone.&quot;

Black Mage No. 33: &quot;They're gonna be so happy.&quot;

Black Mage No. 111: &quot;We have to come up with a name.&quot;

Black Mage No. 33: &quot;Hey... What's happening to me? I feel strange...&quot;

Black Mage No. 111: &quot;M-Me, too...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;......&quot;

[Vivi walks outside and finds Mr. 288 standing at the gate.]

Vivi: &quot;...You stayed behind because you were worried about the chocobo egg.&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;...I don't know. I wanted to follow Kuja because I was
                    so scared of dying. But I couldn't... I felt like I was
                    leaving something important behind.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...... I wanna ask you something.&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;What is it?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;A-Am I gonna stop pretty soon, too?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;!&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;I don't know... Kuja said the prototype built
                    before us would last longer.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;But...I am gonna stop eventually.&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;......&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...I was really confused when my grandpa died. He told me,
      'Vivi, no need be sad.' So I told myself, I can't be sad. That's
      why I felt confused again when I heard that everyone was stopping
      around him. I don't know what to do or what to feel... But when I
      saw Dagger crying when her mom died, I wasn't confused anymore. I
      was sad... If I were just a puppet, I never would have felt that
      way. Mr. 288...we aren't puppets. I know we aren't. ...I hate him.
      I hate Kuja!!! He's turning everyone into puppets just to kill
      people!!! If it weren't for him, I know everyone would understand
      someday. It's not fair...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Vivi...&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;...Kuja's secret palace is on the eastern side
                    of this continent.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;!&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;It's buried under quicksand. You'll need a ship
                    to get there.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Thanks...&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;I hope we can become strong like you someday...&quot;

[He walks away. Dagger walks alone in town.]

Dagger: (Vivi has so much on his mind... Unlike me, he's fighting so
        hard... ...I thought I would change after I met Zidane.
        ...Once I acceded tothe throne, I knew I had to change. But
        nothing has changed...! I'm so helpless...)

[Eiko walks by.]

Eiko: &quot;Wow... Dagger, were you listening, too? That crybaby sure has
      come a long way, don't you think?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Dagger? Are you alright? ...Don't worry too much. Vivi has his
      own way of dealing with things, and you have yours. Come on,
      cheer up! We'll beat up Kuja, and you'll get your voice back in
      no time.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

[Zidane walks over.]

Eiko: &quot;Zidane.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Is something wrong? Okay. Let's get going.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Mr. 288 said Kuja's palace is buried under quicksand, right?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah. We're taking the ship to the eastern side of the
        continent to get there.&quot;

[The party heads to the eastern desert and drops down into the
northernmost quicksand pit, disappearing instantly...]

===========================================================
38. Desert Palace (DP01)
===========================================================

[On the blacked-out screen:]

Kuja: &quot;Huhaha... I knew you'd come. Everything is going according to
      plan...&quot;

[Zidane wakes up in a circular room with the regent.]

Regent Cid: &quot;Zidane! &lt;Ribbit&gt;, wake up!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;U-Ungh... Cid... Where the heck are we?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Good question &lt;ribbit&gt;! I wish I knew!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;After I fell into the quicksand, everything went dark...
        That's all I can remember.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Me, too &lt;ribbit&gt;! When I woke up, &lt;ribbit&gt; I was in
            this room.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh yeah! Where is everyone?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;I don't know &lt;ribbit&gt;. I hope they're alright.&quot;

[Kuja's voice rings out.]

Kuja: &quot;So you're finally awake...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That voice...it's Kuja!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;I'm so happy to see you again.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You rat bastard! Where're my friends?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;My, my... Aren't we feisty today? No need to worry about them.
      They're in rooms not unlike yours. Oh, yes... I should probably
      enlighten you as to your current situation.&quot;

[The floor spirals out a little, revealing a lava-pool bottom.]

Zidane: &quot;Yikes!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;I'm sure that even your feeble mind can grasp what would happen
      if you were to take that plunge. Ahahahahahahaha!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Kuja! You're dead!!!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Oh, dear. Was it something I said? Either way, now that you're
      aware of your predicament, I'd like you to do a tiny little favor
      for me. I'll let your friends live if you say yes.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dammit...&quot;
        R1 --&gt; I have no choice
        R2 --&gt; Never!
</pre><pre id="faqspan-10">
        R2: &quot;Never!&quot;

            Kuja: &quot;You still don't get it, do you? Do you still refuse?&quot;

            [The floor spirals in a little more.]

            Zidane: &quot;Yikes! ...... Dammit, I don't have a choice!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Very good. You've chosen wisely. First, step outside.&quot;

[Zidane and the regent get the heck out of the lava room.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, Cid. I need you to look after the others.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Fine &lt;ribbit&gt;! I won't let you down! And you &lt;ribbit&gt;!
            You come back safe!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, I will. See ya.&quot;

[Zidane walks down the hall and sees the branching paths blocked by mages.]

Zidane: &quot;Not these guys again...&quot;

Black Mage: &quot;......&quot;

Black Mage: &quot;......&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Stand between the two black mages.&quot;

[The black mages warp Zidane off. He appears in a room somewhere.]

Kuja: &quot;Welcome to my humble abode.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Just cut to the chase and tell me what the hell you want!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;My, we're upset, aren't we? Well, this is your errand... I
      want you to go somewhere and bring something back for me.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So tell me what it is already, you demon!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;I'd watch my mouth if I were you. Surely, you haven't forgotten
      that I hold your friends' lives in my hands.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Grr!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;I'm going to send you to a place called Oeilvert.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Where's that?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Oeilvert is south of the Seaways Canyon on the Forgotten
      Continent. It really isn't my kind of place.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What do you mean by that?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;You see, there's an anti-magic barrier around the place. And I
      want to send you because you're too stupid to use magic. Once
      there, I want you to retrieve the Gulug Stone for me. What do
      you say? Isn't it a simple task? I'll even send you on my luxury
      cruise ship, so you won't have to worry about transportation.
      Perhaps it's too much for you. I'd better send you with three of
      your friends just to be safe. Besides, nobody likes to fight
      against himself.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;???&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Heheh, nevermind. Speak their names when you've chosen your
      partners.&quot;

[Zidane selects his party.]

Zidane: &quot;I want _____, _____, and ______.&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Fine. I shall summon them. ________... ________... and
      ______... Step through the door.&quot;

[The three chosen party members walk out.]

Kuja: &quot;Proceed to the center of the platform.&quot;

Black Mage: &quot;......&quot;

Black Mage: &quot;......&quot;

[They teleport the party members to Kuja's room.]

Zidane: &quot;!!!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Spare me the emotional reunion scene, please. Now, go stand
      with your friends.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You'd better keep your promise, Kuja!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Of course. You needn't worry one bit.&quot;

[The four teleport out.]

Kuja: &quot;Khehehe... What a bunch of idiots.&quot;

[Zidane's party warps to the hangar shown in the &quot;Deep Anger' ATE. He
goes around the bend and sees the ship.]

Zidane: &quot;Whoa! That must be the Hilda Garde 1!&quot;

[Zidane's party gets on and it takes off on the world map, airborne
faster than greased lightning. As it soars over the waves, Zidane
makes his way to the cockpit to find some black mages.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, can we really trust Kuja?&quot;

Black Mage: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, can we really trust Kuja?&quot;

Black Mage 2: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey! Say something!&quot;

Black Mage 2: &quot;......&quot;

[Zorn walks into the screen.]

Zorn: &quot;They will not answer to you.&quot;

[Thorn appears.]

Thorn: &quot;Respond to our orders only, they do.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Why, y-you backstabbing bozos!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Those are slanderous words!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Worse lies, I have never heard.&quot;

Zorn: &quot;You needn't concern yourself with such things.&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Or an end to your friends' lives, we shall bring.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dammit!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;The black mages were originally designed just to oppress.&quot;

Thorn: &quot;But a strong sense of self, the Black Waltzes came to possess.
       Always obey us, these mages do, because a strong ego, they have
       not.&quot;

Zorn: &quot;These mass-produced ones are to break once we're through with
      their lot.&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Other purpose than war they have not!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;They have grown attached to life, yet they'll soon disappear!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Hilarious! Nothing but toys are they here!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I don't think you guys are any different.&quot;

Thorn: &quot;What!?&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Rubbish!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You say that the black mages have no souls, but you guys are
        pawns, just like them! Am I right, or what?&quot;

Zorn: &quot;You won't be talking so big once we're done with you!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Regret those words, you will!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Well, let's just take it easy until we arrive. Drive safe,
        alright?&quot;

[On the world map, the majestic HG1 flies over the Shimmering Island
and lands on the Forgotten Continent, where it lands. Zidane's crew
is kicked out. Down the Seaways Canyon, the party stumbles upon their
destination: Oeilvert.]

===========================================================
39. Oeilvert (OV01)
===========================================================

[The party walks up to the spooky place's gigantic locked gate.]

Zidane: &quot;This must be the entrance. Mph! Open up! No way I can open
        a door this big!

Party Member #1: &quot;!!!&quot;
Party Member #2: &quot;!!!&quot;
Party Member #3: &quot;!!!&quot;

[The door opens by itself.]

Zidane: &quot;!!! ...... I dunno what's going on, but I guess we gotta go
        inside. It's an honor to be here, hehe.&quot;

[The party walks in and Zidane touches some orb, making it light up.
In the next room, a planet hologram surprises everyone.]

Zidane: &quot;Is this...a planet?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Was that writing that just appeared?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Mother...Terra...?&quot;

Party Member #1: &quot;!!!&quot;
Party Member #2: &quot;!!!&quot;
Party Member #3: &quot;!!!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Aww...I can't make it out...&quot;

Freya: &quot;Zidane, can you really read it?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It's not that I can read it... It's more like the words are
        talking to me. I don't even know why...&quot;

[The party moves on and comes to a room with four pods. Zidane starts
to figure out the order and gets the first to work.]

Zidane: &quot;Aha, it worked! Ancient...ship... Oldest...in history... I
        knew you just had to do it in the right order!&quot;

[Zidane goes to the next one.]

Zidane: &quot;The ship...for war... Shipbuilding...technology...primitive...&quot;

[He goes to the next and reads.]

Zidane: &quot;Battleship...Invincible...prototype... Prototype...failure...&quot;

[At the last one:]

Zidane: &quot;The first...battleship...Invincible... Improved version...
        currently...in use...&quot;

[Zidane goes back to the globe that didn't glow in the Grand Hall.]

Zidane: &quot;Huh? It's gone. Whoa! Beginning...of the city... ...? Huh?
        Now it's gone again. Whoa! At first...the city...flourished...
        Soon...began to decline... At its peak...cities...all over...
        Terra... Then...the decline...began... So what the heck is all
        this?&quot;

[Zidane heads back to the room with the planet and finds a door able
to be opened. Inside is a room with many stone faces carved into wall
'sockets'.]

Zidane: &quot;What is this place?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Wh-What a disturbing room!&quot;

[One of the faces lights up.]

Voice: &quot;%/\[]oo#+x...&quot;

Freya: &quot;Friend or foe!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wait! It's saying something...&quot;

Voice: &quot;Visitors... Climb atop the stone...&quot;

Quina: &quot;I hear it say!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Huh. I guess it's speaking directly into our minds. Well,
        let's go!&quot;

[They climb onto the stone and it rises up.]

Voice: &quot;Visitors, listen well... This is the record of our civilization...
       The seeds' decline was not our fault... All vegetation and...
       vessels...died out... The decay of our Terra...triggered it all...
       In order to stop the decay, many methods were considered...
       Ultimately, the best minds of Terra's civilization gathered... Then,
       a final resuscitation was attempted on the mother continent...
       Unfortunately, it ended in failure... It was later discovered to have
       been the catalyst... Subjects were selected... After four tremendous
       sacrifices, eternal prosperity seemed within reach... Flora and fauna
       were revived, but...is still in stasis. Final results...are still
       pending... In order that our glorious history not die with us, we
       were constructed...&quot;

[The faces quit lighting up and the stone descends.]

Steiner: &quot;Zidane, what could this possibly be!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I wanna know, too...but our friends are in danger! So let's
        save them first!&quot;

[Zidane runs into the room with the moogle (Stiltzkin is now gone) and
stops when a display starts to light up before him.]

Zidane: &quot;? Hmm... It looks different than before. It looks like that
        other planet.&quot;

[Another planet appears beside the other hologram.]

Zidane: &quot;Wh-What's this? Another planet?&quot;

[The two planets merge into one.]

Zidane: &quot;What the heck could this mean?&quot;

[In the next room, a plate takes them to the bottom of a long tunnel.
Zidane goes up to a tombstone and a stone drops down from above.]

Zidane: &quot;!!! So this is what Kuja was harping about. Time to head back.
        Whoa! ...? Something's coming!&quot;

[The party squares off with Ark and defeats it, taking the Gulug
Stone.]

Zidane: &quot;We gotta get back to the others!&quot;

[The view switches back to Desert Palace again.]

===========================================================
40. Desert Palace (DP02)
===========================================================

Eiko: &quot;Why am I trapped in here!? Hey! Someone lemme out! This is no
      way to treat a lady! Aww... I hope Zidane and the others are
      alright... I'm sure they'll come back for me.&quot;

[Kuja's voice rings.]

Kuja: &quot;So, how do you like the special suites I reserved for each of you?
      By the way, Zidane is out running an errand for me in return for
      your safety. But I hate keeping promises... And I so love deceit.
      So, I thought I would give you a special death to remember me by.
      My palace is home to a magnificent hourglass. As its sands fall,
      the floors of your rooms slowly open. Well? Isn't it a fabulous
      idea? Your lives will be spared if the hourglass is reset. If
      Zidane comes back in time, that is. Oops, just ten more minutes.
      Better start praying. Farewell... My sweet, lovable morons.
      Ahahahahahahaha!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;What!? Somebody help me!&quot;

[Outside, Cid listens to Kuja speak.]

Kuja: &quot;Farewell... My sweet, lovable morons. Ahahahahahahaha!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;That bastard Kuja! That does it &lt;ribbit&gt;! If I don't
            save them, no one will!&quot;

[Two black mages walk by.]

Black Mage No. 69: &quot;Say... I reset the hourglass and locked it because
                   I was ordered to. What we're doing is wrong, isn't
                   it?&quot;

Black Mage No. 12: &quot;Wait. Isn't that better than to stop functioning?&quot;

Black Mage No. 69: &quot;......&quot;

Black Mage No. 12: &quot;C-Come on, let's go back.&quot;

Black Mage No. 69: &quot;Turning off that trap again? I still don't
                   understand how you do it.&quot;

Black Mage No. 12: &quot;You basically have to turn them all on. You're
                   just thinking too hard. Let's go.&quot;

[Regent Cid watches them walk off, then enters the room they left.]

Regent Cid: &quot;That must be the key they were talking about &lt;ribbit&gt;!&quot;

Narrative: Get the key! Press the (O) button to go forward.

[Cid gets the key and does the minigame (see DP03 for full details)
and gets up to the hourglass.]

Regent Cid: &quot;Just have to turn this upside-down &lt;ribbit&gt;! &lt;Ribbit!&gt;
            Now, everyone should be alright &lt;ribbit&gt;!&quot;

[In the cells, the party that was left behind walks out.]

Eiko: &quot;I thought I was a goner! Thank goodness we made it!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Aha! You all made it &lt;ribbit&gt;!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;!? Huh? You saved us?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;And it wasn't easy, mind you... But we've no time to
            celebrate &lt;ribbit&gt;! I heard from two black mages that
            there's some kind of trap up ahead. They said you basically
            just have to turn them all on, whatever that means &lt;ribbit&gt;.
            Let's hurry!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;That's right! We can't just rely on Zidane! We have to work
      together until Zidane gets back! We can do it if we stick
      together!&quot;

[The party runs through the palace corridors, lighting candles and
removing bloodstones. At the last candle:]

Voice: Intruder alert. Defense system activated. Initializing automatic
       countermeasures. Transferring from observation to attack mode.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Huh? That's not Kuja's voice! Who's there!? Come out and show
      yourself!&quot;

[A battle begins with Valia Pira, and ends with its destruction. The
party lights the last candle, and hops on the new teleportation pad.]

Narrative: Meanwhile...

[Zidane is just arriving back in the place on the Hilda Garde 1.]

Zidane: &quot;Finally made it back. Well, no rest for the wicked! I gotta
        get movin'!

[The party gets on a teleport pad and ends up somewhere unfamiliar.]

Zidane: &quot;What the... Where are we now? Did I take a wrong turn?&quot;

[Kuja's voice rings out.]

Kuja: &quot;Welcome back... I'm inside the room past the stairs. But I want
      you to come alone, Zidane. Alone.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;It is surely a trap! Proceed with caution!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, tell me about it. I'll be okay! You guys just wait here.&quot;

[The door opens for Zidane in the next screen.]

Kuja: &quot;Come inside...&quot;

[Kuja's there.]

Kuja: &quot;I'm so happy to see you again, Zidane.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;My friends better be alright!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Oh my! Blunt as always, I see... Take a look in there.&quot;

[In the hole in the floor, four &quot;party members&quot; lie unconscious.]

Zidane: &quot;!!!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;No need to worry. They just needed some rest, that's all. Now,
      give me the Gulug Stone...&quot;

[Outside, in the teleportation room, the three party members pace the
halls.]

Steiner: &quot;...... I wonder how the others are doing... Why, if something
         happened to the princess, I don't know what I would do!&quot;

Freya: &quot;!!!&quot;
Steiner: &quot;!!!&quot;

[The rest of the party members come in on a teleportation device.]

Eiko: &quot;Huh? Where's Zidane?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;He went alone to Kuja's chamber. But how did you escape?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Actually...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;There's no time! We gotta go stop Zidane!

[Everyone races into the room, with Eiko bringing up the tail-end. The
door closes as she tries to enter, though, and she runs into it.]

Eiko: &quot;Aaa! What the heck!?&quot;

[Zorn and Thorn sneak up behind her... Inside Kuja's Room:]

Kuja: &quot;Now, give me the Gulug Stone...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You bastard! You're the worst scum alive!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;&lt;Yawn&gt; I grow weary of your tantrums. Well, will you hand it
      over or not?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Don't give it to him, Zidane!&quot;

[The party runs in.]

Zidane: &quot;Huh!? So, who's inside this cage?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Oh dear, I wasn't expecting this. That's right, the ones inside
      are fake! But don't think you've won yet.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What do you mean by that?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Hehehe...&quot;

[Eiko yells from the hall.]

Eiko: &quot;Aaa! Leave me alone!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Eiko!&quot;

[Regent Cid yells, too.]

Regent Cid: &quot;&lt;Rrrrribbit!&gt; I'll protect you!&quot;

[One of the jesters says:]

Jester: &quot;What a freak! This frog can speak!&quot;

Jester 2: &quot;Frog that goes squish, you'll make a fine dish!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;...Ungph!... ...... ...&lt;R-Ribbit&gt;...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Aw, man... Hey!!&quot;

[Kuja uses his magicks to take the Gulug Stone from across the room.]

Kuja: &quot;I wanted to finish you off after getting the Gulug Stone and
      killing all your friends... Instead, I'll just take the girl.
      I hope we meet again.&quot;

[Kuja teleports out of the room.]

Zidane: &quot;Arrg! It won't respond.&quot;

Freya: &quot;He plans to flee in the Hilda Garde!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Let's get him!&quot;

[Zidane selects his party and runs after Kuja, finding the hangar
empty. He runs to the path previously blocked by a black mage.]

Zidane: &quot;Dammit! He got away!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;We can still follow him in the Blue Narciss!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Great minds think alike! Let's go, people!&quot;

[The Hilda Garde cruises to the Lost Continent, with the Blue Narciss
hanging out of sight in its wake. Onboard:]

Blank: &quot;He headed toward some weird-looking structure.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Is there anything beyond there?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What the hell is Kuja up to...? Why did he take Eiko?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;His motives are unclear &lt;ribbit&gt;... That girl can summon
            eidolons, too &lt;ribbit&gt;?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah. That's it! He's probably after her for the same reason
        he was after Dagger!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Don't worry, Dagger... We're not gonna let him have his way.
        Kuja's got a lot to answer for.&quot;

===========================================================
41. Mount Gulug (MG01)
===========================================================

[The party runs into Esto Gaza, which is at the foot of the mountain.
The town, which was fairly full before, is now deserted for the most
part.]

Bishop: &quot;What do you beggars want? You are in a holy place. Keep the
        noise down. Hmph! Just like all the other pointy-hats! No
        manners at all.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, mister, what did you just say? Have you seen some guys
        that look like my friend here?&quot;

Bishop: &quot;How dare you address me so! I am the priest of Esto Gaza, the
        holy place in which you stand. Mind your tongue, child. Are
        you in league with that brazen crew?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Tell me where they went! Was there a little girl with them?
        My friend's life is in danger! Tell me what you know, now!&quot;

Bishop: &quot;All life is equal. The living will return to the stars.
        Through the Path of Souls of the Shimmering Island.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What are you talking about? Didn't the black mages have a
        girl with them?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;How dare a man of the cloth turn a blind eye to evil!&quot;

Bishop: &quot;I just watched them. Besides, they didn't do anything wrong.
        They barged in, hundreds of them! So, that was the dreaded
        black mage army... They headed straight for Mount Gulug without
        even looking at me.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Mount Gulug?&quot;

Bishop: &quot;An enormous volcano that went extinct in the days of old.
        Legend has it that a race of great moles once lived within the
        caverns. But that was a very long time ago. No mortal has entered
        those depths ever since the entrance was mysteriously sealed. They
        passed through here and went straight for Mount Gulug.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;And? What about the girl?&quot;

===========================================================
41. Mount Gulug (MG01)
===========================================================

[The party descends into the depths, and eventually finds a path
that overlooks a would-be extraction ceremony about to take place.]

Vivi: &quot;Zidane, it's Eiko! Kuja and the black mages are there, too!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Eiko! That must be the extraction spell!&quot;

[Down below, Zorn and Thorn start up their chant.]

Zorn: &quot;Eidolon of eternal life!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;Eidolon of infinite powers!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Arise from they eternal slumber!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;Depart after thy endless wait!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Let there be light!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;Let there be life!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;The time has come!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;The time is now!&quot;

[Up above, Dagger runs in and sees the scene.]

Dagger: &quot;!!! ...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wait, Dagger!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;!!!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We all know how you feel, Dagger, so leave this to us...
        Okay?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;...&quot;

Zidane &quot;C'mon, let's do it!

[The party runs off and Dagger just watches. Back below, Zorn and
Thorn look at Eiko.]

Zorn: &quot;That was odd.&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Odd, that was.&quot;

Zorn: &quot;We failed again!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;Again we have failed!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Did you make some mistake?&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Make mistake, I did not! Yours, the mistake must be!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;I made no mistake at all!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;The truth, do you speak?&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Of course, I speak the truth!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Will you two just shut up!?&quot;

Zorn: &quot;I-It's his fault!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;H-His fault, it is!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;The one who messed up is you!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;You're the one who messed up!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;I said shut up! I don't want to hear excuses! I sense power
      from within her. Continue the extraction!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Continuing further will endanger the subject's life!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Only at the age of sixteen can eidolons be extracted!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;You two just don't get it! I need an eidolon more powerful than
      Alexander! An eidolon with the power to bury Garland! His powers
      are so incredible; I cannot even come close. I must destroy him
      before Terra's plan is activated, or my soul will no longer be
      my own! Who cares if she lives? I want that eidolon!&quot;

[Zorn and Thorn watch Kuja walk away, then approach Eiko. Mog hops
out and knocks 'em back.]

Mog: &quot;Kupo!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Where did that come from?&quot;

Thorn: &quot;You, get out of our way!

[The moogle persists.]

Zorn: &quot;Master!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;Master!&quot;

Mog: &quot;Kupo...!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Well!?&quot;

Zorn: &quot;Her pet moogle is interfering with the extraction process!&quot;

Thorn: &quot;Certain are we that it caused the failure!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Kill the runt! We're running out of time!&quot;

Mog: &quot;Kupo...!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Mog... No, Mog. Hide behind me... Mog? What is it?&quot;

[Mog starts to float.]

Mog: &quot;Eiko, thank you for everything.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Mog, what are you saying?&quot;

Mog: &quot;Don't worry, kupo. I will always be with you, kupo.&quot;

[A bright light ensues. From the passageway, Zidane hears Eiko yelling.]

Eiko: &quot;Mog!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;This way!? Whoa!&quot;

[The light stops Zidane from entering. Eiko watches Mog start to glow.]

Eiko: &quot;Mog!&quot;

Zorn: &quot;We will put you to death!&quot;
Thorn: &quot;Put you to death, we will!&quot;

[Zorn and Thorn attack Eiko and the Trance (!?) Mog.]

Mog: &quot;Eiko! Use Terra Homing, kupo!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Okay!&quot;

[Eiko blows Zorn and Thorn away with her most powerful (and new) summon.]

Mog: &quot;I wanted to be by your side, Eiko...so I became Mog. Don't worry.
     I'll always watch over you, kupo.&quot;

[Mog disappears and Zidane runs over to Zorn and Thorn's silent bodies.]

Zidane: &quot;!!! Eiko, are you okay?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;I'm alright. Mog saved me... I never knew that Mog was an eidolon.
      She always looked after me...disguised as a moogle. Even though...
      even though she was weak... She fought her best to protect me.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So that's what happened...&quot;

[Eiko looks up and catches Mog's ribbon.]

Eiko: &quot;Mog's ribbon... Mog...&quot; [Receive: Ribbon]

Zidane: &quot;It's alright, Eiko. Mog'll always watch over you.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;You're right...&quot;

[Kuja walks into the screen.]

Kuja: &quot;How can that--That moogle went into a Trance!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Kuja!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;So...an eruption of anger against one's surroundings induces a
      complete Trance! It's not the will to live, nor is it the desire
      to protect another!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Man, you're really goin' off! Hello!?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;That means...I simply need a powerful soul, even if that soul
      is not my own! No, wait... And it can be found there! Hahahaha!!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Kuja! What are you plotting?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;I am done with you!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;W-Wait a minute!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Vivi! Look out!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Don't worry, I hear these twins put on quite a good show. Of
      course, they're really not twins at all...&quot;

[Kuja leaves.]

Vivi: &quot;Wait! What about the black mages?&quot;

[Vivi runs off.]

Zidane: &quot;No, Vivi! It's too dangerous!&quot;

[Zidane attempts to run after, but Zorn and Thorn's lifeless bodies
thump the ground and startle him.]

Zidane: &quot;Whoa!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Zidane, something's wrong.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I thought we defeated them!&quot;

[The two rise up and mesh, becoming Meltigemini; the party defeats
them anyway. Vivi walks over with some mages afterwards.]

Zidane: &quot;Vivi, where's Kuja? Did he get away!? Vivi?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Everyone knew he was lying...but they still followed him. He
      said that our life spans can't be extended, and that we were
      fools for believing him.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What!? Kuja said that?&quot;

Black Mage No. 78: &quot;I-I'm so sorry...for all I've done...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You guys don't have to apologize. Where are the others?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;They were so shocked to hear it, they're all sitting down over
      there. Zidane! What am I supposed to tell them!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Vivi... Hey, Vivi, where're you going?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;All I can do...is just sit with them.&quot;

[Vivi leaves with the mages.]

Zidane: &quot;That bastard! When I get my hands on him--&quot;

Woman: &quot;Pardon me, but is someone there?&quot;

[Zidane runs into a room where a woman is.]

Woman: &quot;Who might you be? Where has that...Kuja gone?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh, him. He split, lady.&quot;

Woman: &quot;What? You chased him away? I know not who you are, but you
       have my sincere gratitude.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;...&quot;

Woman: &quot;Could this be...Princess Garnet? Why is it! It is you!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;...&quot;

Woman: &quot;Oh, how long has it been! I haven't seen Your Highness for
       ages! Why, look how you've grown... So, whatever brought you
       to this dreadful place?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Who is this lady? What's a friend of yours doing here, anyway?&quot;

[The frog regent runs in.]

Regent Cid: &quot;Oh! My darling &lt;ribbit&gt; Hilda! I finally found you
            &lt;ribbit&gt;!&quot;

Hilda: &quot;I do not remember ever marrying a toad.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;I-It's me &lt;ribbit&gt;! Cid!&quot;

Hilda: &quot;Of course, that mustache... It really is you!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Hilda, come back to the castle &lt;ribbit&gt; and return me to
            my former self &lt;ribbit&gt;!&quot;

Hilda: &quot;Dreadfully sorry, my sugar cup, but I surrendered your favorite
       airship to a man named Kuja.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Forget about it &lt;ribbit&gt;! As long as you're alright &lt;ribbit&gt;!&quot;

Hilda: &quot;Oh, my sweet froggy-woggy!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;So, uhh... You know Kuja? I'm gonna make him pay! Please tell me
      all about him!&quot;

Hilda: &quot;Very well, my dear. I shall tell you everything once we reach
       Lindblum.&quot;

===========================================================
42. Lindblum (LB04)
===========================================================

[The party goes back to Lindblum, and the regent and Hilda talk in
private in the royal chamber.]

Regent Cid: &quot;&lt;Ribbit!&gt; Kuja didn't touch you, did he?&quot;

Hilda: &quot;His soul was filled with hate, but he was polite to me. He
       just talked an awful lot.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;What about? &lt;Ribbit!&gt;&quot;

Hilda: &quot;Well, he divulged his master plan to me. I didn't even have
       to ask. It was tiresome. But what he spoke of... It was truly a
       scene from a nightmare.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;What did he say?&quot;

Hilda: &quot;That he was not of this world. He said his aim was to use this
       world to acquire an even more destructive power... The taking
       of Hilda Garde 1 was a part of this process.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;We must tell Zidane about this! &lt;Ribbit!&gt; You have
            valuable information!&quot;

Hilda: &quot;Which lead me to believe that my abduction wasn't a part of his
       plan. He was a hopeless narcissist, but... But at least he wasn't
       a skirt-chaser, like you.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;...Ugh! You just hit me where it hurts most. &lt;Ribbit!&gt; I'm
            sorry about that! That's why I risked my life to rescue you!&quot;

Hilda: &quot;Oh, really? Are you sure you weren't there to take back Hilda
       Garde 1?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;I'm not lying! &lt;Ribbit!&gt; I apologize! So please turn me
            back! &lt;Ribbit!&gt; I'm sick of being an oglop or a frog! I'll
            never cheat on you again! &lt;Ribbit!&gt; I promise!&quot;

Hilda: &quot;...Can your words be trusted?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;I don't lie! &lt;Ribbit!&gt; I swear on my father's name!&quot;

Hilda: &quot;Alright. I'll turn you back. But it's going to be much worse
       if you ever cheat on me again!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;I...I understand. Now turn me back!&quot;

Hilda: &quot;Maybe I'll turn you into a hedgehog pie.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Erk... P-Please, no! &lt;Ribbit!&gt; Now turn me back!&quot;

Hilda: &quot;Alright, alright.&quot;

[She gives him a kiss and the Regent is back to his old mustache'd
self.]

Regent Cid: &quot;Finally... Ribbit! I'm human again! Gwok! Now I can
            concentrate on building Hilda Garde 3! ......&quot;

Hilda: &quot;......&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;...D-Darn it! I must stop that.&quot;

Hilda: &quot;Dear...

Regent Cid: &quot;I'm sorry about everything, Hilda.&quot;

[Cue the embrace!]

Dagger: &quot;Zidane...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hmm...? Dagger?&quot;

Voice: Mr. Zidane...

[A guard wakes Zidane up from a Dagger dream.]

Zidane: &quot;Why are you calling me 'Mister' Zidane...?&quot;

Soldier: &quot;Mr. Zidane! Please get up!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;! Oh, it was just a dream... What's up?&quot;

Soldier: &quot;Lady Hilda is calling a meeting. Please go to the conference
         room.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Okay. I just wish I could've dreamt a bit longer...&quot;

Soldier: &quot;Huh?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.

[Zidane walks to the conference room upstairs. Everyone is there
except Dagger. Zidane looks at the mustached man on the throne.]

Zidane: &quot;Who's that guy?&quot;

Freya: &quot;...It's Regent Cid.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;WHAAAT!?&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;...Still hasn't got any manners. Ribb-- ...... Ahem!
            Still haven't learned your manners!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You can stop the frog-talk now.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;S-Silence! Ribbit!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Oh well.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Ugh... I didn't gather you all to talk about that.&quot;

Hilda: &quot;I called for this meeting to tell you about what I learned
       while in Kuja's captivity.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;It may provide a hint about where he may be. Listen
            carefully.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;...I don't see the princess. I shall look for her.&quot;

[Steiner retreats.]

Regent Cid: &quot;I will begin constructing Hilda Garde 3. The Blue Narciss
            will be used for its construction. Now, Hilda will tell you
            the rest. Hilda?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So? What did Kuja discuss with you?&quot;

[Cid leaves.]

Hilda: &quot;Some parts of the story may be hard to believe, but please hear
       me out. ...Kuja plans to use this world as a means of acquiring
       an even greater power.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Greater power? What would he do with it?&quot;

Hilda: &quot;I don't know... He indicated that he wasn't of this world.&quot;

Quina: &quot;!!!&quot;
Vivi: &quot;!!!&quot;
Eiko: &quot;!!!&quot;
Freya: &quot;!!!&quot;
Amarant: &quot;!!!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What?&quot;

Hilda: &quot;We call our world Gaia. But he called his birthplace Terra.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Terra, huh...?&quot;

[The ATE 'Team' plays.]

Hilda: &quot;This Terra seems to be connected with a place called the
       Shimmering Island.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I don't know where Kuja went, but maybe we can find him if
        we go there...&quot;

Hilda: &quot;...Unfortunately, you can't get directly to Terra from the
       Shimmering Island.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Of course you can't. Everyone would've discovered this
         'other world' by now if it were that easy.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So, what do we do?&quot;

Hilda: &quot;...I'll tell you. The gateway that connects the two worlds is
       sealed, but Kuja said there is a place where the seal can be
       broken.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Where's that?&quot;

Hilda: &quot;He said it's an old castle located in the northern area of the
       Forgotten Continent. An explorer left a record of his trip to
       this particular castle on the Forgotten Continent. If I remember
       correctly, he wrote that the cliffs were too steep to explore.
       Other than that, very little is known about the Forgotten
       Continent... Well, since this castle doesn't have a name, let's
       call it Ipsen's Castle.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Ipsen's Castle, huh...? Yeah, we don't know anything about
        the world beyond our continent.&quot;

[The ATE 'Recovery' plays.]

Hilda: &quot;...That's all I heard. You may find a clue if you go to Ipsen's
       Castle.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Did you ask Kuja about all of this?&quot;

Hilda: &quot;These are things he discussed voluntarily. He became very
       impassioned as he spoke... And he volunteered information without
       even my asking. He probably thought telling me his plans wouldn't
       affect his grand scheme.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;He's right. His power is great, but we're at a disadvantage.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;But I can't forgive Kuja! He toyed with my friends' lives!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Now we know where we need to go. The problem is getting there.
        I guess we'll have to wait until Cid finishes building Hilda Garde
        3...&quot;

[Steiner runs in.]

Steiner: &quot;Zidane! I bring troubling news!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What? What now?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I cannot find the princess! I've looked all over Lindblum!
         The members of Tantalus aided me in my search, but...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;She's not in Lindblum? ...Then there's only one place.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Do you know where she is?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I think so... You guys wait here in Lindblum. I'll be right
        back.&quot;

[Zidane runs off to...Alexandria!? Members of Tantalus are also there,
running around the streets.]

Cinna: &quot;Ahhh! Where are you guys going!?&quot;

Zenero: &quot;We're gonna look for Dagger!&quot;

Benero: &quot;Is there anyone else we need to look for?&quot;

Cinna: &quot;No! But we looked there already! Go someplace where we haven't
       already looked!&quot;

[Cinna runs off.]

Zenero: &quot;Cinna's so demanding...&quot;

Benero: &quot;True, true...&quot;

[They follow him. By the mini-theater, Blank and Marcus see Ruby.]

Blank: &quot;Hey, Ruby!&quot;

Ruby: &quot;Blank! Marcus! How y'all doin'?&quot;

Blank: &quot;We're doing alright. How's show business, Ruby?&quot;

Ruby: &quot;Well, the money ain't no good, but I'm havin' fun. I like it.&quot;

Blank: &quot;That's great! Our hideout in Lindblum got completely destroyed.
       It's gonna take a miracle to fix the place.&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Bro, we better...&quot;

Blank: &quot;Oh! Sorry! We came to Alexandria for a reason. Have you seen
       Dagger?&quot;

Ruby: &quot;Dagger...? Naw, I ain't seen her. What about her? You fixin'
      to kidnap her again?&quot;

Marcus: &quot;No, we're just looking for her this time.&quot;

Ruby: &quot;I was only kiddin', Marcus. I'll ask the patrons to be on the
      lookout.&quot;

Blank: &quot;Thanks, Ruby!&quot;

[They run off.]

Ruby: &quot;I wonder if Zidane is here with these good ol' boys...?&quot;

[At the castle, Zidane sits by the empty gondola dock.]

Zidane: &quot;This is strange... I was sure that she'd be back in Alexandria...
        Where else can I look?&quot;

[Baku appears.]

Baku: &quot;Hey, Zidane! I've been lookin' for ya!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Boss! Have you found Dagger?&quot;

Baku: &quot;Nah... Can't find her anywhere! I didn't find Dagger, but... I
      think I saw that chick...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That chick?&quot;

Baku: &quot;Yeah, you know, that chick! I'm gonna check again.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, wait! Who is she? What are you talking about!?&quot;

[Zidane follows Baku down to the harbor.]

Zidane: &quot;Where are you going, Boss? Is she here?&quot;

Baku: &quot;She was standin' over there just a second ago...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Over there...? !&quot;

[Beatrix walks into sight on a pier below.]

Zidane: &quot;Is that who I think it is?&quot;

[Zidane runs down there, but Beatrix isn't there anymore.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey!&quot;

[He runs to a different place and sees her back in the same spot.]

Zidane: &quot;Ah, over there!&quot;

[He runs down there and she's gone...]

Zidane: &quot;Where did she go...?&quot;

[Beatrix walks up by Baku.]

Baku: &quot;Still alive, eh?&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;You are...Baku?&quot;

Baku: &quot;Yup, I'm the man who abducted yer princess!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Let us forget about that. It happened a long time ago...&quot;

Baku: &quot;You got a big heart, unlike that knucklehead, Steiner. No wonder
      the women are runnin' the show here. Gwahahaha!&quot;

[Zidane runs up.]

Zidane: &quot;Boss! You must've seen Beatrix! Hey!&quot;

[They all talk by the gondola dock later.]

Beatrix: &quot;As you can see, Alexandria was completely destroyed...
         Steiner and I did our best to protect Alexandria... ...but
         our efforts were in vain.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Steiner was worried about you. Why haven't you contacted him?
        Dagger's still in shock. She's been mute ever since the attack.&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;She is...? Then it is better for her not to return to this
         city for a while... It won't do her any good to see Alexandria
         like this...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Well, here's the thing... We can't find her. I thought she'd
        be back here, but I can't find her anywhere.&quot;

Alexandria: &quot;She is back in Alexandria? But she's nowhere to be found...?
            Have you looked in the resting place?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;'Resting place'?&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Yes, if she is back in Alexandria, I am certain that she will
         be there. ...There are a couple of favors I'd like to ask you...
         If you see Princess Garnet, please tell her not to worry about
         Alexandria... She must take care of herself first.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Sure. What else?&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;I'd like you to give something to her.&quot; [Receive: Garnet]
         &quot;Maybe it will help the princess get through this time of
         uncertainty...&quot;

[Zidane walks up the stairs to the resting place later on, and finds
Dagger standing in front of her mother's memorial.]

Zidane: &quot;I've been looking for you, Dagger.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You can talk again!?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I... I've been thinking since...the disaster. I've been thinking
        that I have to become a queen and bring back peace to Alexandria.
        That's why I came back here, but... Can I stay with you guys for
        a while longer?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Can I ask why?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;When my mother was still alive... My primary concern was how
        to talk and look like a princess. Those were the only things
        on my mind... That didn't change when my mother died and I was
        about to become a queen... I only thought about how to look and
        act like a queen. I don't think the people will accept me as
        their queen the way I am right now.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I don't know about that.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I have no right to rule over this country...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hmm... Oh, I almost forgot! Beatrix wanted me to give this
        to you.&quot;

[He tosses it to Dagger.]

Dagger: &quot;Is this...a garnet?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That's right... Isn't it pretty?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;It's beautiful...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That gem used to be just another ordinary stone... The stone
        made a wish... 'I want to shine!' The stone traveled from person
        to person, in keeping with its wish... And now, it's shining in
        your hand, Dagger. If you're willing to make an effort... You'll
        shine, too, someday! The day will come when Alexandria needs you!
        There's no rush. The important thing is to have the desire.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Thanks... I have to apologize for using you guys as an excuse
        to run away from my responsibilities...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, what's important is that you honestly want to stay with us...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane...? Can I borrow that knife again...?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Which one?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;The one that helped me make my last big decision...&quot;

[She snatches it from him and tosses up in the air like pro.]

Dagger: &quot;I'm borrowing this! Zidane... Remember the way I was...for me.&quot;

[Dagger runs down the steps, leaving Zidane behind. FMV. Dagger uses
the knife to cut her hair short, kinda like a right of passage into
womanhood. In Lindblum, the Hilda Garde 3 lifts off from the dock and
flies out into the sky successfully. Dagger and Zidane get onboard
eventually.]

Eiko: &quot;Wh-Wh-Wh-What happened!? What happened to your hair!?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;P-P-Princess!!! What have you done!?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;I know! Zidane broke your heart, didn't he!? How dare he--&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I-I-Is that true!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Whoa, hold on. Don't jump to conclusions!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane's right, Eiko.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;!?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Dagger! You can talk again?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yes... I'm sorry I made you all worry.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;It's okay, but your hair... It was so beautiful.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Short hair doesn't suit me?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Oh, no. You look great!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Thanks, Eiko.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It's still too early to celebrate... Erin! You know our
        destination.&quot;

Erin: &quot;Yes, Ipsen's Castle on the Forgotten Continent!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That's right. We'll go there to find out how to enter Terra
        through the 'Shimmering Island.'&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I'm sure we'll find out more about what's going on once we
        reach Terra.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah... And hopefully, we'll learn about what Kuja wants to
        achieve...&quot;

Erin: &quot;The location of Ipsen's Castle has been marked on a map based
      on Lady Hilda's information. Please check by pressing [SELECT]
      after we depart! You can also press (&gt;&lt;) on the bright spots on
      the map, and the ship will take you to those locations automatically.
      You can check how to maneuver the hsip automatically by pressing (/\)
      while the large map is open!&quot;

[A sailor walks up.]

Crew Member: &quot;Excuse me! Please let me know if you'd like to switch
             out your party members! I shall assist you in any way
             that I can during your journey.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You don't have to be so formal. Let's just relax and enjoy
        our flight.&quot;

[On the world map, the navigation screen opens:]

-Airship Navigation-

(&gt;&lt;)       : Forward
(/\)       : To the deck
([])       : Reverse
(O)        : Disembark

[The party heads to the castle in question, on the continent far away.]

===========================================================
43. Ipsen's Castle (IC01)
===========================================================

[The party walks to the old castle which, strangely, is built like a
mirror image of itself across a horizontal axis -- in other words, the
bottom looks like the top...]

Zidane: &quot;Is this the old castle Hilda told us about? What a strange-
        -looking place... Like it's upside-down or something...
        Alright, I'll take 3 of you with me. The rest of you secure
        this spot.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;...Hey, Zidane.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...? What's up, Amarant?&quot;

Amarant: &quot;I work alone. Always have, always will. I don't know why you
         bother carryin' dead weight all the time.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What's your point?&quot;

Amarant: &quot;I'm sayin' working alone beats working in a team any day,
         and I'm gonna prove it. Hilda said there's some key here to
         break the seal, am I right?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Let's see who finds it first. I'll be going by myself, of
         course.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Amarant! You selfish, ignorant fool!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Calm down, Rusty.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;B-But...!&quot;

Zidane: (What should I do?)
        R1 --&gt; Let him go
        R2 --&gt; Don't let him go

        R1: &quot;...Okay. I don't know what you're thinking, but if
            that's what you want, it's okay by me.&quot;

            Amarant: &quot;Well, aren't you an agreeable fellow?&quot;

        R2: &quot;...Sorry, I can't let you do that.&quot;

            Amarant: &quot;That's too bad. I'm going anyway.&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;......&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Well, see you later.&quot;

[Amarant leaves.]

Freya: &quot;...Are you sure about this, Zidane?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What can I do? I can't change the way he thinks. Let's get
        going, everyone! We'll beat Amarant at his own game!&quot;

[Zidane forms his party and sets inside. They finally get to the
mural room, but Amarant has beat them to the punch.]

Zidane: &quot;!&quot;

Amarant: &quot;You're late, Zidane, and I'm the winner. See how much you
         lose by working with others?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Have you figured out how to break the seal?&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Take a look at that wall. Maybe you can figure it out. But
         it's no longer my concern.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

Amarant: &quot;I proved myself right. I don't need to follow you around
         anymore. We may be enemies next time we meet... See ya.&quot;

[Amarant walks out.]

Eiko: &quot;Ugh! Who does he think he is!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...It's his way. We can't change him.&quot;

[Zidane goes up to the mural and finds four mirrors on it.]

Zidane: &quot;Let's see... ...? There's something written on it. 'My power
        is protected underwater, surrounded by the earth.'&quot; [Receive:
        Water Mirror]

[Zidane goes to the next one.]

Zidane: &quot;Let's see... ...This one, too. 'My power is protected high
        atop a fiery mountain.'&quot; [Receive: Fire Mirror]

[Zidane goes to the next one.]

Zidane: &quot;Let's see... And this one... 'My power is protected behind
        a tornado.'&quot; [Receive: Wind Mirror]

[Zidane goes to the next one.]

Zidane: &quot;Let's see... That means... This one, too. 'My power is
        protected under the shaking ground.'&quot; [Receive: Earth Mirror]

[Zidane runs back to his party.]

Zidane: &quot;Well, looks like we got what we came for. Let's go.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Were those writings in a language only you can read?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, they were the same as the ones I saw at Oeilvert...
        Like Hilda said, those things on the wall must have something
        to do with the seal. Let's think about that later. We need to
        get out.&quot;

Voice: &quot;M-Mirror... Return...to me...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Who's there?&quot;

[A large clawed monster appears.]

Monster: &quot;Energy flow...interrupted... Energy to...Terra... You dare
         get in the way of Terra's master plan...?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wh-What is this!?&quot;

Monster: &quot;My name...is Taharka. Return...my mirrors...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You should say please when you ask for things.&quot;

Taharka: &quot;Fool! You'll regret this...&quot;

[Taharka attacks but, for a guardian, is repelled like an insect.]

Taharka: &quot;One is all, all is one... You'll never break the seal...&quot;

[Taharka's dying body disappears. The party heads back to the court
with the moogle. Eiko almost steps in a trapdoor.]

Eiko: &quot;Ahhh!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey! Are you okay?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;O-Of course I'm okay!&quot;
</pre><pre id="faqspan-11">
Freya: &quot;How clever. We must have activated a trap when we reached the top.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Well, I'm glad you're okay. Let's go. They're waiting for us
        outside.&quot;

[They run back to the outside screen.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, sorry to keep you all waiting.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;You win, Zidane. You came out first!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What? What happened to Amarant? He was waiting for us at the
        top and left as soon as we got there! I thought he took off!
        Is he still inside...? You guys wait here. I'm gonna go look
        for him.&quot;

[Zidane heads inside and soon hears a--]

Voice: &quot;Uh...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Who's there!?&quot;

Voice: &quot;Uh...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Who's there?&quot;

[Amarant is lying on his back near a drop-off.]

Amarant: &quot;Zidane...? Why did you come back...?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Amarant? What happened to you?&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Answer my question... I told you we might be enemies next
         time we met... Or did you come back to mock me?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You say some strange things. The guys outside told me that
        you hadn't come out yet. That's why I came here looking for
        you.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;We don't have anything to do with each other anymore... You
         don't have anything to gain from this. Or do you? I don't
         understand you. I don't understand the way you think...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Who cares about what I have to gain? You need help right now.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;You don't care...? You're willing to put yourself at risk
         to save me?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Come on. We've helped each other many times since we joined
        forces. You're a part of the team. That's all that matters. I
        don't know why I'm doing this, but I can't just walk away. It
        goes against my nature.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;And that's what being part of the team means...?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Isn't it? Come on, that's enough talk. Let's get outta here!&quot;

[They head back to the entrance.]

Zidane: &quot;Listen up, everyone. Let's sort out what we found in the
        castle. On top of this castle is a mural, a map of the world.
        There were 4 mirrors on the mural. The writing on the mirrors
        was in the language only I can read. 'My power is protected
        under the shaking ground.' 'My power is protected behind a
        tornado.' 'My power is protected high atop a fiery mountain.'
        'My power is protected underwater, surrounded by the earth.'
        I'm sure the mirrors are pointing us to the locations that
        help us break the seal. What the monster said before he perished
        was a clue about the seal... 'One is all. All is one.' Meaning,
        there is a connection between these 4 seals...&quot;

[The party gets back on the Hilda Garde.]

Dagger: &quot;So, what do we do? Are we going to take each location one by one?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;'One is all, all are one'... We're going to conquer all 4
        locations at once.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;We're not going together like we always do?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;No. I'm going to drop off two of us in each location.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;I see... Hey, I'll go with Dagger!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What? Why...?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;It's called 'ladies first,' Zidane! And we girls have things
      to talk about!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Uh-huh. Is that okay with you, Dagger?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Sure, but... Where are we going first?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Well... The nearest location would be...&quot;

Crew Member: &quot;One of the locations you mentioned is just south of us!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh, you were listening to us?&quot;

Crew Member: &quot;I've been a sailor for a long time! I'm confident in my
             sense of direction. 'My power is protected underwater,
             surrounded by the earth.' The location must have something
             to dowith water; why not go there first?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright... Thanks for your help.&quot;

Crew Member: &quot;Please don't hesistate to ask me if you forget your
             destination! And please remember to equip yourselves
             properly while we are onboard!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You can relax, buddy. You're beginning to sound like someone I
        know.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright, Erin! Let's go!&quot;

Erin: &quot;Yes, sir! Now departing!&quot;

[The party flies south to the nearest shrine, that of water.]

===========================================================
44. The Four Shrines
===========================================================

[Zidane, Eiko, and Dagger drop down onto the temple in the whirlpool.]

Zidane: &quot;Are you gonna be okay by yourselves?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;You're the one who suggested we split up.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;What? Don't you trust me and Dagger?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It's not that I don't trust you...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Hmph! You just wanted to pair up with Dagger!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;You better get going. We need to take all points simultaneously.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You're right...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Where are you going next, and who are you going to drop off?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;'My power is protected atop a fiery mountain.' I think I'll
        ask Freya and Amarant to take that location.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Alright, now, get going! Don't make us ladies wait!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I'll be back to get you guys soon!&quot;

[Zidane leaves.]

Eiko: &quot;Well, now that the men are gone, we can do all the girl talk we
      want!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;...Girl talk?&quot;

[Zidane's team flies to the volcano on the Lost Continent, and the
two to depart meet with Zidane in the engine room.]

Crew Member: &quot;We're going to overheat!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Just a little closer!&quot;

Freya: &quot;Zidane! The heat is going to kill the engine if we get any closer!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Okay... When we get closer to the volcano, you two head to the
        shrine's entrance.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;...Why do I have to go with her?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh, sorry. Did you want to go with Eiko?&quot;

Amarant: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Good luck!&quot;

[The two depart.]

Zidane: &quot;Alright, the next destination is...'protected behind a tornado.'
        Pairing up Steiner and Quina seems like a bad idea... I think I'll
        ask Vivi to babysit Steiner.&quot;

[The party flies to the Wind Shrine on the Forgotten Continent.]

Vivi: &quot;W-Wow, the wind is strong...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It's the wind shrine, so it's protected by strong gusts...
        Be careful not to get blown away!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;There is no need to worry! Master Vivi, just follow me.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;O-Okay...&quot;

[Vivi stands behind the armor-heavy Steiner.]

Steiner: &quot;See? There is nothing to fear!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Really?&quot;

[Vivi steps out from behind the lee side of Steiner and almost blows
off of the ship. Steiner runs to him.]

Steiner: &quot;Master Vivi!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You're okay because you're wearing armor.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Let us move forward, Master Vivi!&quot;

[They leave.]

Zidane: &quot;Are they gonna be okay...? But I'm with Quina. I should worry
        more about myself. We should check our equipment and see what
        blue magic Quina can use... 'My power is protected under the
        shaking ground,' huh...?&quot;

[Zidane and Quina go down to the Earth Shrine, near the Kiera Desert.]

Zidane: &quot;Let's get going...&quot;

Quina: &quot;Ah, Zidane. You want go with me!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Well... I sort of got stuck with the leftovers...&quot;

Quina: &quot;You no have to explain! I so happy.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Huh?&quot;

Quina: &quot;There old saying in my tribe... 'Leftovers good!'&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Let's hope we find good things in this cave.&quot;

Quina: &quot;Is probably full of good food!&quot;

[They walk in a ways.]

Quina: &quot;Is no one here... Is empty.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah... Huh?&quot;

Quina: &quot;What wrong?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Did the ground just shake...?&quot;

[The floor panels start moving up to trap the party, but they jump
over them. The view switches to Eiko and Dagger.]

Eiko: &quot;This place is creepy...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;It's too quiet...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;They probably got scared of us and ran away!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I hope so...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Aaargh! I hate it when you fret like that! That's why I always
      worry about you!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Wh-What are you talking about?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Oh, nothing. I just have a lot of things on my mind...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;...... !? Look out!&quot;

[Dagger dive-tackles Eiko so she doesn't get crushed by a large chunk
of ice. The view switches back to Zidane and the Qu.]

Quina: &quot;Aiyaaa! We almost flat like pancake!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I hope there aren't too many more of those. Dagger... Please
        be safe...&quot;

[View switch to Eiko/Dagger, again.]

Eiko: &quot;W-What the--&quot;

Dagger: &quot;It's a trap! Be careful...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Aaah!&quot;

[She dodges another one.]

Dagger: &quot;Let's go, Eiko!&quot;

[The view changes back to the Earth Shrine party.]

Quina: &quot;Aha! Is place to put mirror.&quot;

[Zidane approaches the indentation.]

Zidane: &quot;I'll place the mirror right here...&quot;

Voice: &quot;I've been waiting for you...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;!?&quot;

[The view switches to the Fire Shrine party.]

Freya: &quot;That was too easy... It must have been disappointing for you.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;......&quot;

Freya: &quot;Now, I'll place the mirror here...&quot;

Amarant: &quot;!? Freya, stand back!&quot;

[A large monster pops up where she was just standing.]

Freya: &quot;!?&quot;

Fire Guard: &quot;It's just as Kuja said... He said I should expect intruders.&quot;

[At the Earth Shrine party, a large skull-faced monster descends.]

Zidane: &quot;Are you under Kuja's command!?&quot;

Quina: &quot;He not good person! Why you work for him?&quot;

Earth Guard: &quot;No... We are the guardians of Terra...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Guardians of Terra...?&quot;

[At the fire shrine:]

Fire Guard: &quot;Yes, we are the guardians of Terra. Filled with the power
            of Terra itself...&quot;

Freya: &quot;What is Terra!?&quot;

Fire Guard: &quot;We did not become guardians to chat with mortals... We
            derive pleasure from ending your worthless lives...&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Just to prove how powerful you are...&quot;

Fire Guard: &quot;So you understand. But will that knowledge help you?&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Foolish.&quot;

Fire Guard: &quot;What?&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Picking fights with strangers in a place like this... I used
         to know someone like that. He was a loser... He refused to
         find beneficial ways to use his power. Instead, he'd seek out
         people to fight...&quot;

Freya: &quot;Amarant...&quot;

Fire Guard: &quot;What...are you talking about?&quot;

Frea: &quot;We'll show you what he means!&quot;

Fire Guard: &quot;Interesting...but you'll regret this!&quot;

[In the Wind Shrine, Vivi and Steiner are fleeing from a dragon boss.]

Vivi: &quot;Ahhh!!!&quot;
Steiner: &quot;Grahhh!!!&quot;

Wind Guard: &quot;Finished already? Such weaklings.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;You...!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;He's too fast! I can't target him with my magic. We can't take
      him on with just the two of us...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Master Vivi! A true man never gives up in a fight!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;But...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;We can defeat this monster if we work together!&quot;

Wind Guard: &quot;So? Which one of you will perish first?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Silence! I shall vanquish you!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;What!?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;...Master Vivi, I shall attempt to hold him down. You attack
         him with your magic while I hold him down!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;But...what if I miss the target...?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I trust you, Vivi.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...Okay.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;AAAAAAAAARGH!!!&quot;

[The two lunge into the fray; meanwhile, Zidane and Quina speak to the
skull-faced freak.]

Earth Guard: &quot;Kuja told us there'd be eight rats...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Sorry, it's just the two of us. Did you have a feast prepared?&quot;

Quina: &quot;You no worry! We eat everything.&quot;

Earth Guard: &quot;Ah, so you're attempting to conquer all 4 shrines at
             once... How futile.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We'll see about that!&quot;

Quina: &quot;Must try eating before we give up!&quot;

Earth Guard: &quot;What will you lower life-forms do on Terra?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We won't know until we get there!&quot;

Quina: &quot;Must eat to find out what taste good! Is my lesson from
       traveling around world.&quot;

Earth Guard: &quot;Good... I shall show you the true meaning of fear!&quot;

[The party kills the Earth Guard. Zidane places the mirror.]

Zidane: &quot;All done!&quot;

Quina: &quot;I wonder if everything okay?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're waiting for us by now.&quot;

Quina: &quot;Right! We go back to airship now.&quot;

[They leave the shrine. The view switches to Eiko and Garnet.]

Eiko: &quot;Fresh air! Finally! Zidane is unbelievable... Asking us ladies
      to fight a monster like that... Oh my gosh!!!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What's wrong, Eiko?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Oh, I completely forgot! And we're all alone, too!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Wh-What is it?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;There's a question I need to ask you! I've been waiting for a
      chance to ask you for longest time! Give me an honest answer,
      okay?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Well, you have to ask the question before I can answer...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;...Do you love...Zidane...?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Wh-What? Why...?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;You have to answer me! Do you love him or not? Hey, it's the
      airship! Zidane's back!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Did you just say something, Dagger?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Let's go, Eiko!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;H-Hey, wait! That's not fair!&quot;

[Everyone is on the airship now.]

Zidane: &quot;Well, now that we've got everyone, we can head to Shimmering
        Island... Hey, Amarant. I didn't know you were here.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;So we'll go to Shimmering Island, then to Terra?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah. It's near Esto Gaza. It won't take long.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;...... Tell me something... What motivates you to do this?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What motivates me...?&quot;
        R1 --&gt; I do everything for Dagger
        R2 --&gt; To find out what Kuja is after
        R3 --&gt; I don't know

        R1: &quot;I do everything for Dagger! Why would I be doing this if
            not for her?&quot;

            Amarant: &quot;...Too embarrassed to answer the question seriously?&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;But I AM serious! It's true, man. What's the deal?
                    Why so serious all of a sudden?&quot;

            Amarant: &quot;I don't understand you...&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;There's no fun in figuring things out right away!&quot;

        R2: &quot;I want to find out what Kuja is after. I also want to know
            more about the planet Terra...&quot;

            Amarant: &quot;Can't resist the urge to step into an unknown
                     world, huh...?&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;What, you think I'm going there just to satisfy
                    my curiosity?&quot;

            Amarant: &quot;Am I wrong?&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;No, I guess you're right.&quot;

        R3: &quot;I really don't know.&quot;

            Amarant: &quot;You don't even know why you do the things you do?&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;I didn't say that. Maybe I do it because I don't
                    know what motivates me. To understand something is
                    interesting, but what's already understood is boring.
                    I'm sure we'll understand something when we go to
                    Shimmering Island and go to Terra.&quot;

[Zidane leaves.]

Amarant: &quot;I'm beginning to understand why he won and I lost... I lost
         against his way of thinking...&quot;

[The party heads to the Shimmering Island.]

===========================================================
45. Shimmering Island (SI01)
===========================================================

[The party rides the Hilda Garde above the island.]

Crew Member: &quot;Master Zidane! I'm showing abnormal readings!&quot;

Erin: &quot;It feels like the ship's getting sucked in!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Zidane! It might be dangerous to keep going!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Are we gonna bust in on the airship!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;All we know is that this is the entrance...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I heard the people of Esto Gaza call it the 'Spirit Road'...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;The path that leads the souls to Terra...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Maybe it's a teleportation gate, like the one in Kuja's
        hideout...&quot;

Erin: &quot;Mister Zidane! We're going to get sucked in! What shall I do!?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;What now, Zidane? We may not be able to turn back!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright, then...&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Keep moving forward!
        R2 --&gt; Let's pull back for now!

        R1: &quot;Keep moving forward! We're going out on the deck!&quot;

            Eiko: &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;If Dagger is right, we can jump into the teleporter!&quot;

            Dagger: &quot;From this height!?&quot;

            Zidane: &quot;We'll be fine! Considering all that we've been
                    through, this is nothing!&quot;

        R2: &quot;Let's pull back! We need to get equipped before we go.&quot;

[After seeing R1, an FMV plays. The Hilda Garde rides into the soul's
gate and the party floats off the deck into the gate. It's kinda
reminiscent of some 2001: A Space Odyssey scenes, actually... After
that, they end up in a strange place...]

Zidane: &quot;Could this be...Terra? What's this light? Could it be... !?&quot;

[The man in black last scene on the Invincible (Garland) appears near
where Zidane stands.]

Old Man: &quot;So you finally came. The time has come at last... The one
         who folds time is here.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Who the heck are you!?&quot;

Old Man: &quot;Ask my name, will you? Then let us ask... What is your name?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Me!? My name is--&quot;

Old Man: &quot;What is your name?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, what's your problem!? I'm trying to tell you my name.&quot;

Old Man: &quot;So you believe a given name has meaning... Boy, you have
         been bewitched by the light of the blue moon.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What do you know? You must be from Terra.&quot;

Garland: &quot;You know nothing, and that is all. Come and see for yourself...
         See what Terra is, and what you are...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;H-Hey, hang on!&quot;

[Garland disappears.]

Zidane: &quot;He's gone...&quot;

Voice: &quot;Zidane!&quot;

[Dagger appears.]

Zidane: &quot;Dagger! Are you alright?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yes. Everyone's fine. Come, let's hurry...&quot;

[Zidane picks his party and sets down the road. He spies a girl.]

Zidane: &quot;!? Hey...!&quot;

[She flees; he follows. In the next screen he finds her...]

Zidane: &quot;!? Hey, wait up!&quot;

[...but she runs off again. In the next screen:]

Zidane: &quot;...? What's your problem...?&quot;

[He gives chase again.]

Zidane: &quot;Where'd she go?&quot;

[He finds her after climbing down some webs.]

Zidane: &quot;Who are you?&quot;

Mysterious Girl: &quot;You don't remember anything, do you?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;!?&quot;

Mysterious Girl: &quot;Follow me, and you will understand us. ...and
                 maybe your own heritage as well.&quot;

[She runs off.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey, wait! Hold on a sec!

[Zidane runs ahead, and the girl beckons him to go on and see Terra
for himself. The party walks up some steps.]

Zidane: &quot;What the heck...? What is this place?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;It looks so artificial. So different than before.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah... But it doesn't seem very lively.&quot;

Mysterious Girl: &quot;Welcome home.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;!?&quot;

Mysterious Girl: &quot;This is where you belong. The place to which you
                 shall offer yourself... ...is here.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hold on a second! What the heck are you talking about!?
        Wh-What the--&quot;

[FMV. The Invincible rises up near the two. Dagger stares up at the
hideous eye that destroyed Alexandria and Madain Sari and faints.]

Zidane: &quot;Dagger! Wake up! Dagger! Dammit! What the heck is going on!?&quot;

[On a blacked-out screen, the mysterious girl says:]

Mysterious Girl: &quot;You are completely oblivious. Just like a newborn
                 child. You don't know why you were given life, or
                 for what purpose you exist... You simply shout to
                 emphasize your life...your own existence. You are
                 completely oblivious.&quot;

[The screen opens again and Zidane runs up the steps.]

Zidane: &quot;We gotta find a place for her to rest!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Zidane! Leave the princess to me. You must go reconnoiter
         at once!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, you're right. There's gotta be some place around here...
        Watch over her, Steiner! I'll be right back!

===========================================================
46. Bran Bal (BB01)
===========================================================

[Zidane runs into town and sees a lot of monkey-tailed people like him.]

Zidane &quot;!? Wh-What's going on? Everyone has a tail...and their hair is
       just like mine!&quot;

[Zidane goes into an inn nearby.]

Zidane: &quot;This looks like a good place for Dagger to get some rest.
        But...what's up with everyone here? They're all so...stiff. I
        dunno why...but I have a bad feeling about this place. Well,
        first things first. I gotta bring Dagger back here!&quot;

[Meanwhile, Eiko is running around town, talking to monkey-tails who are
ignoring her.]

Eiko: &quot;'Scuse me... Do you have any medicine...? ... Hello... Is there
      a place I can buy some medicine around here?&quot;

Person: &quot;...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Hello!? I'm asking if you have any medicine! Ngaaa! How come
      this place is full of weirdos? Everyone has a tail like Zidane...
      Aww, if I could only find some Pimo-pimo herbs, I could make some
      wake-up powder for her... But is this my lucky day? No! Huh!?&quot;

[Eiko looks at the girl who led Zidane into Terra.]

Eiko: &quot;Found ya! You're that girl, right? It's your fault Dagger
      collapsed, you know... Oh, never mind. Say! Do you have any
      medicine at all?&quot;

Girl: &quot;She will soon awaken.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;How do you know?&quot;

Girl: &quot;Where is your man?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;M-My man? MY man!? Are you talking about Zidane!? Even I never
      called him that! But too bad for you! He and Dagger are super
      hot for each other! You don't have a chance with him.&quot;

Girl: &quot;Tell him I am waiting in the underground laboratory.&quot;

[She walks away.]

Eiko: &quot;Oh, the nerve! What makes you think I'd tell him that!? Hey,
      where do you think you're going!? What a bimbo! Uh-oh! I don't
      have time for this!&quot;

[She runs into the inn. Meanwhile, the party's already inside, waiting
on Dagger to wake up.]

Zidane: &quot;Dagger...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess... Why must you suffer more...?

Zidane: &quot;Dammit!&quot;

Freya: &quot;What is the matter, Zidane? You haven't been yourself at all.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What the heck do you mean, I haven't been myself...?&quot;

Freya: &quot;...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I'm sorry... I don't even know what's wrong with me. I
        just...I just can't concentrate with this blue light...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Ah... Uhhh...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess! You have awoken!&quot;

Freya: &quot;What made you lose consciousness so suddenly?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I remembered.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Remembered what?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;It wasn't a storm that destroyed Madain Sari. It was...it was
        the eye on that airship that destroyed Madain Sari. You
        remember, don't you? The eye was also there when Alexandria
        was leveled.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Yes, there was a large eye in the sky above from which light
       emanated.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Now that you mention it... It was there when Bahamut went
        wild at the Iifa Tree.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yes... It was there in the sky. It must be the same airship.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;WHAT!? Then that must be the ship that slew Her Majesty...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Rusty!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Oh... I-I'm sorry, Princess!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Don't worry about it! I've already come to terms with that.
        That ship took everything from me... It took away my parents,
        my homeland, Alexandria...everything.&quot;

Freya: &quot;How terrible...&quot;

[Eiko runs in.]

Eiko: &quot;Dagger! Are you alright?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yes, I'm fine...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;No, you're not! You're still pale! You gotta rest! Hmm? How
      come everyone looks so pale? What's wrong?&quot;

Freya: &quot;No need to be concerned. A strange place such as this is cause
       enough for exhaustion.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Oh... Hey! Where are you going, Zidane? Oh, that's right! That
      weird girl! The girl that led us here said something strange
      again! She said she was waiting for you in some underground
      laboratory! What a pervert!&quot;

[Zidane walks off.]

Eiko: &quot;Zidane?&quot;

[Zidane goes down to the laboratory.]

Zidane &quot;...&quot;

[He sees people similar to him in test tube stasis.]

Zidane: &quot;Oh, so that's what's going on... Geez, I should've guessed...
        So, that is what you wanted to show me?&quot;

Girl: &quot;Yes. I am glad you understand.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I don't wanna understand! Sorry, but I'm not like that. I
        mean all these guys with tails, who look just like me...
        They're a bunch of zombies.&quot;

Girl: &quot;They are my peers. We are Genomes. We live in this village.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Genomes? Is that what they're called?&quot;

Girl: &quot;Not just them, but you and me, too. It is the name of the seed
      given to all of us. Its name is Genome.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Talk about a let-down. Who would've guessed that the home
        I've yearned for would be a dump like this. No wonder I never
        found it. It's not even on Gaia!&quot;

Girl: &quot;Why are you not happy? You have returned to the place of your
      birth.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Happy? You guys can process that emotion? Look at 'em! Look
        at all their blank faces!&quot;

Girl: &quot;What can we do? After all, we are made that way. And we are
      built to watch over each other and work together as soulless
      Genomes.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What's it all for!? Get to the point already! How come I grew
        up on Gaia if I was born here!? I'm alive! I have a soul! Why
        is everyone here so...&quot;

Girl: &quot;Because you are...special.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What!?&quot;

Girl: &quot;We are mere vessels. You have been given a greater purpose. The
      will of Garland is absolute...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Garland? Who's that?&quot;

[Zidane follows her up to the meeting room.]

Girl: &quot;Garland watches over this planet. His mission is to restore the
      people of Terra.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;R-Restore the people of Terra? You mean people besides these
        guys here?&quot;

Girl: &quot;They are merely vessels. So am I, and so are you. But the true
      people of Terra have been asleep for ages, waiting for their
      time to come. When the time is right, the light of this planet
      will change from blue to red, and Gaia will become Terra.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wait a sec! So the people of Terra are out to take over Gaia!?&quot;

Girl: &quot;What else can there be? Terra has always absorbed new planets
      to survive. And when the time comes, the souls of the people of
      Terra will occupy the Genomes. Such is the restoration of the
      people of Terra.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Why do they have to be so tedious!? Why don't they just wipe
        us out with magic like they did Alexandria!?&quot;

Girl: &quot;Once, Garland tried to use a more forceful method, but failed.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Then he should just quit and leave Gaia alone!&quot;

Girl: &quot;Because of his failure, he was forced to wait a long time.
      ...To wait until Gaia's civilizations gained tremendous power:
      The power to use eidolons.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So that's why you attacked the summoner's village and
        destroyed Alexandria.&quot;

Girl: &quot;Planets have a cycle of souls. Souls are born from the planet,
      and then return to it. Garland planned to gain control of that
      very cycle... ...and you were supposed to help him achieve that.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What!?&quot;

Girl: &quot;Garland is waiting for you. Come...&quot;

[She walks off.]

Zidane: &quot;What do you think you're doing!? I don't care about all this
        Terra and Gaia stuff!&quot;

[The view changes to Eiko inside the inn.]

Eiko: &quot;Zidane isn't back yet. And with Dagger not feeling well... I
      wonder where he is.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Eiko...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;No, Dagger! You can't get up yet!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I'm alright. Listen, I want to ask you a favor.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Oh? Just tell me, and I'll get right on it!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I want you to go find Zidane.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Huh? Oh, sure. Okay. Oh, I get it! You're getting jealous!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;No, I'm not... I just have a feeling something terrible is
        going to happen.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Alright! I'll go get him. So you just stay here and rest!&quot;

[Eiko runs around town and goes to the hilltop past the green aura,
finding the 'Girl' with Zidane.]

Eiko: &quot;Now, you listen to me! Where did you take Zidane?&quot;

Girl: &quot;He went on his own to see Garland.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Garland!? Oooo, THAT's a sinister name! But Zidane wouldn't
      just leave us hanging!&quot;

Girl: &quot;He went... Yes, he went to find out the reason for his existence.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Liar! That's a terrible lie!&quot;

Girl: &quot;'I am an enemy of the people of Gaia,' he said as he walked
      through the gate to Pandemonium.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;! We-We gotta tell the others!&quot;

[Eiko runs off.]

Girl: &quot;Heaven grant the wandering souls eternal repose...&quot;

[At the gate to Pandemonium, Zidane appears.]

Zidane: &quot;So, this must be Garland's haunted mansion... Talk about bad
        taste in interior decorating. Alright... Time to teach this
        tyrant a thing or two...&quot;

[Zidane enters the 'haunted mansion.']

Voice: &quot;So, we meet again.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;!?&quot;

[Garland appears.]

Zidane: &quot;Who are you!?&quot;

Old Man: &quot;Twelve years ago, I lost one of my most prized Genomes. I
         created him and sent him to Gaia to disrupt the cycle of
         souls there. You are that Genome... I am glad you have returned.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Shut up! Nobody tells me what to do! And I didn't come here
        to answer to you! Lemme guess... You must be Garland!&quot;

Garland: &quot;And what if I am?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Then you're goin' down! But first, you're gonna tell me
        everything! Like, why did I grow up on Gaia, and why do you
        want to destroy it!?&quot;

Garland: &quot;I have no intention of destroying Gaia. I only wish to make
         Gaia into Terra.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What did you just say!?&quot;

Garland: &quot;Of course, not everything went as planned. You growing up on
         Gaia, for example. There is another one built as you were. He
         may be the one who threw a wrench into my gears.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;He!? Who the heck are you talking about!?&quot;

Garland: &quot;Someone you know quite well. Follow me... The time when the
         aura of Gaia will turn to the crimson glow of Terra has not
         yet come. I may need your help anyway.&quot;

[Zidane follows him into the next screen.]

Zidane: &quot;Stop! Now, tell me everything!&quot;

Garland: &quot;I constructed the Genomes to be vessels for the souls of the
         people of Terra when they awaken. But 24 years ago, I gave
         life to a Genome that was very much like you. His will was too
         strong to make him into a proper vessel, and I even considered
         discarding him. But then I thought that I should put his
         strength to use. I sent that Genome as my servant, to disrupt
         the cycle of souls on Gaia.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, so tell me who he is already.&quot;

Garland: &quot;Do you not yet know? You and he are so very much alike.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alike? I've never met anyone like me...&quot;

Garland: &quot;You judge only be appearances. I mean someone with a soul
         similar to yours. The one I sent to Gaia might also be called
         your brother... And his name is Kuja.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Kuja!? He's a Genome!? Impossible! He doesn't even have a
        tail...&quot;

Garland: &quot;He is only hiding it. He denies his own identity. He rejects
         the meaning of his own existence and tries to assert his own
         individuality. Don't you see the resemblance?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Shut up! I'm not like him at all!&quot;

Garland: &quot;He said the same thing when speaking about the other Genomes:
         'I'm not like these guys.'&quot;

[In the next screen:]

Garland: &quot;His ambition was unbecoming of a Genome, but it was perfect
         for the mission I gave him. To bring war and chaos to Gaia...
         That was what I sent him to do. To induce an unnaturally
         chaotic flow.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So then, why--&quot;

Garland: &quot;The disruption of the flow of souls is best brought about
         by war. And what he did for me far exceeded my greatest
         expectations.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What about me!? How did I end up on Gaia?&quot;

Garland: &quot;When you received the gift of life in Bran Bal, Kuja could
         not bear it. He could not bear to see a Genome with more
         power than his own; he felt threatened. Kuja discarded you.
         He dropped you onto Gaia, the world he would destroy.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So I was to be slave, just like Kuja, to start a war on Gaia?&quot;

Garland: &quot;That is correct. I did not expect Kuja to abandon you, but I
         believed it was his nature. And to him, bringing war to Gaia
         would prove his victory over you. Perhaps it is because of
         his desire to justify his existence that he let you live as
         well.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So, that is why the blood of thousands had to be spilled?&quot;

Garland: &quot;Are you referring to Kuja's ambition? Or to our plan to
         disrupt the cycle of souls?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Both! And what exactly do you gain by disrupting that cycle
        of souls, or whatever...&quot;

Garland: &quot;We must sort the souls. I want to disrupt Gaia's cycle and
         drain its souls, filling the void with the souls of Terra. To
         speed the cycle of souls is to speed the work as a whole. Thus,
         war... And in time... Gaia's souls are gone, and Gaia becomes
         Terra.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;But...how!?&quot;

Garland: &quot;You saw it with your own eyes. You saw the Iifa Tree and
         the Mist it emits. The role of the Iifa Tree is that of Soul
         Divider. The Mist you see comprises the stagnant souls of
         Gaia...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh yeah? But we stopped the Mist! So much for that!&quot;

Garland: &quot;All you saw was the back of the tree... Even now, the Iifa
         Tree blocks the flow of Gaia's souls, while it lets those of
         Terra flow freely. Come and see for yourself. See the true
         form of this planet.&quot;

[In the next screen, Zidane sees a picture of Gaia starting to redden.]

Zidane: &quot;What is this?&quot;

Garland: &quot;Think of it as an observatory. A place to measure the radiance
         of Gaia and Terra.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What are you talking about? And what is this weird light?&quot;

Garland: &quot;That is the center of the planet. The end and the beginning
         of the cycle of souls. The light remains Gaia's for now, but
         when the blue changes to crimson, all will belong to Terra,
         and its restoration will be complete. That is why I wrapped
         up the light in the Iifa Tree, to prevent the cycle of the
         judgment of souls on Gaia from inside the planet. Such is the
         Iifa Tree's true purpose, its true form. All you saw was its
         material form. The flow of Gaia's souls cannot be changed by
         stopping the disposal of the Mist.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So...Kuja is just an angel of death who sends souls to the
        Tree of Iifa.&quot;

Garland: &quot;Yes, my angel of death. But only until you came of age.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What do you mean!?&quot;

Garland: &quot;His soul is not eternal... I was going to create you next,
         after all.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You mean you won't need Kuja's soul once I grow stronger than
        him?&quot;

Garland: &quot;Precisely... Soon, that time will come.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...&quot;

Garland: &quot;Well...now you should be fully aware of the meaning of your
         existence... !?&quot;

[Zidane has jumped towards Garland's position, and is advancing to
him by way of the stairs.]

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, I'm aware of all the laughter, all the tears I've shared
        with the people I grew up with on Gaia.&quot;

Garland: &quot;Forget all that. You are destined to live among the stars
         for all eternity. You have the power, the position, and the
         motive to do it.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I wouldn't want that kind of power...if I only had a place to
        call home... My brothers in Tantalus, Vivi, Freya, Amarant,
        Quina, Steiner, Eiko, and...Dagger... My home is with them in
        Gaia! If you say I have a motive, then it's to punish all of
        you who brought pain to my friends! I'll destroy Terra! That's
        reason enough for my birth here as a Genome!&quot;

Garland: &quot;Regrettable... I thought your soul would be perfect for a
         new angel of death...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I AM the new angel of death! Yours!!!&quot;

Garland: &quot;Don't you know what it means to meet your maker?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Shut up! I've heard enough of your crap! I'm taking you out,
        right here, right now!&quot;

Garland: &quot;Foolishness...&quot;

[Garland speaks, but only in Zidane's head (?):]

Voice: The body becomes a vessel, which greets a new soul...

[Zidane holds his head.]

Zidane: &quot;What's happening!?&quot;

[He collapses.]

Garland: &quot;He's too good to make into a regular Genome... But I have
         no choice.&quot;

[Elsewhere in Terra, Kuja walks by a cliff.]

Kuja: &quot;Ungh... ...... I can't believe I actually returned to this
      place, but... Soon... Soon, the power will be mine alone.
      Mhwahahah... Just you wait, Garland! And you too, Zidane! I'll
      exact sweet revenge upon you both for insulting me! I'll make
      the people of both Gaia and Terra know who rules over all of
      them! Ha-Haha... Ahahahahahaha...&quot;

[Below, the Invincible starts to activate. Somewhere else, Zidane sits
in a chair all alone in a dark room, in a subsconscious identity fight.
A blacked-out screen denotes the nature.]

Zidane: &quot;Who am I? I don't know anything. I cannot think at all.&quot;

Voice: &quot;Zidane!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah... I was called that once. Many people called me that.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;You always have to show off, don't you?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, maybe I do.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Why, you worthless mendicant!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yep... Sounds about right.&quot;

Freya: &quot;How very becoming of you.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Becoming of me...?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I really learned a lot by traveling with you, Zidane.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, right. I have nothing to teach...&quot;

Quina: &quot;You teach me many things more important than tasty munchies.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;No! I don't know anything!&quot;

Amarant: &quot;You call that friendship?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Friendship... Friendship...?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I don't know...who I am...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;You were always there for me, Zidane...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I'm so... tired...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;How come you're always so...?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I... I am...an...empty...vessel...&quot;

Voice: &quot;Zidane!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Who?&quot;

Voice: &quot;Wake up, Zidane!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Who...?&quot;

Voice: &quot;Come on, Zidane, wake up!

[The blacked-out screen fades and Eiko and Vivi are by Zidane.]

Zidane: &quot;Ow...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Zidane!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Vivi... Eiko...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Thank goodness, you're alive! We thought you were dead!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh... I...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;We were so worried! Why did you come here all by yourself?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What...are you doing here?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Huh? We came to save you, of course...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;And it wasn't easy! You went off all alone!&quot;

[Zidane starts to walk past them.]

Zidane: &quot;Leave me alone...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Huh?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;This has nothing to do with you.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Oh, come on!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;There he goes, being the tough guy... Look, Zidane... It's not
      just about you.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Come on, Zidane... Don't be like that. Let's--&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Shut up! Just shut up, you stupid brat!&quot;

[Zidane walks through the door, but a portcullis prevents the other
two from following after.]

Vivi: &quot;Zidane!?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Zidane...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Zidane, wait up!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;You need rest, Zidane!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Will you little twits just shut up! There are some things
        kids can't understand.&quot;

[Zidane is attacked by an Amdusias, but defeats it. Amarant and Freya
arrive mid-battle.]

Freya: &quot;How foolish of you to go alone.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Damn hypocrite. Always talking about friendship, when you're
         nothing but a selfish loner.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I can take care of myself.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Come back, Zidane!&quot;

Amarant: &quot;...&quot;

[Zidane walks into the next room.]

Zidane: &quot;!?&quot;

[Steiner's blown back by something.]

Steiner: &quot;Ngwah!&quot;

[Quina is, too.]

Quina: &quot;Aiya!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;I will not be defeated so easily!&quot;

Quina: &quot;Now I mad! I cook you good!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Steiner...Quina... What are you doing...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Have at thee!!!&quot;
Quina: &quot;Taste this!!!&quot;

[The battle begins against an Abadon, which gets defeated, too. Zidane
fights with them halfway through.]

Steiner: &quot;Hmph! What an unworthy opponent!&quot;

Quina: &quot;Zidane, you no can leave us! I still want you take me place
       have lots good food!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;And I have not yet concluded whether or not you are the
         right man for Her Highness, mind you!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Just...leave me alone. I don't want to trouble you anymore.&quot;

Quina: &quot;...&quot;
Steiner: &quot;...&quot;

[In the next room:]

Zidane: &quot;You're all a bunch of babysitting bastards! But trust me, I
        know that I'm the worst bastard here.&quot;

[A Shell Dragon attacks, but is defeated with some help from Garnet.]

Zidane: &quot;Dagger...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;You try to do everything yourself, don't you?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Try to understand... I don't want to cause trouble to anyone.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Aren't we your friends!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I want to think so! That's why I always... Look, I'm not from
        Gaia! I was just a hairbreadth from becoming the destroyer of
        Alexandria! I can't accept your friendship so easily!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;You've always protected us. But you still don't understand
        that we looked out for you, too! We watched your back while
        you watched ours. And we believed in you the same way you
        believed in us! Just like you protected us... We want to
        protect you.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dagger...&quot;

[The party starts to come in.]

Quina: &quot;You say it! My master tell me, somebody give you tasties, you
       give them tasties, too. Is good manners! I still not cook you
       succulent frog yet, Zidane.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Quina...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Chivalry requires a knight to look after his comrades-in-arms.
         I will not abandon you! And I shall follow you to kingdom come
         if I must. You remember that!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Steiner... Ha... What am I gonna do with you guys?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;The feeling is mutual!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Alright, let's go! Wait... Where are the four others?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You don't think...they've been trapped?&quot;

Quina: &quot;Is possible...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;You should not have left them!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;That's right! I mean, really...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Aww... I'm sorry. Let's head back... Together, this time!&quot;

[The party walks back to that first room.]

Freya: &quot;!?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Zidane!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Zidane! Why did you leave us!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I'm sorry... You were right... I need everyone's help.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Don't leave us again, okay?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Never...&quot;

Freya: &quot;So, you've had a change of heart.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;What a busy guy, coming and going all the time...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, but not anymore. We have to stop Garland...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Oh yeah, that's right! A moogle followed me all the way from
      Bran Bal!&quot;

Moorock: &quot;Just tell me if you need to rest, kupo!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright! Now we can work our way out of this depressing castle!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;'Cause we're all together now!&quot;

[The party regroups and sets off to the elevator. The ATE 'The Elevator'
may or may not play during this. Eventually, the party will be asked--]

Narrative: Go up one floor? {Y/N}

[The party soon passes by a moogle who yells at them when they try
to exit the area:]

Mozme: &quot;Danger ahead, kupo! Do you still want to go on, kupo?&quot; {Y/N}

[The party enters the next area and finds Garland.]

Garland: &quot;There's the observatory... You told me you'd become my angel
         of death... But think for a moment... Isn't life death itself?
         It must kill other life-forms to survive... Sometimes it even
         kills those with whom it shares blood... To live is to give
         life meaning, yet one must take others' lives to survive... A
         mature civilization becomes aware of this paradox... Terra's
         souls will sleep until they forget such nonsense. They will
         begin a new life in a new dimension. It's a world in which
         life and death become one... That is the dimension in which
         we are meant to live, as beings that transcend life and death!
         Zidane... I'll ask you one more time. Who are you!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You're a sad man, Garland... We know more than you... We're
        not perfect, but we have friends who help us. That is reason
        enough for us to live!&quot;

[The three other party members give their say:]

Eiko: &quot;We live to protect the ones we love!&quot;
Quina: &quot;I exist to eat, but also exist to live!&quot;
Amarant: &quot;Blind pursuit of power is a meaningless vice.&quot;
Vivi: &quot;It took us a long time, but we've all found our way.&quot;
Freya: &quot;We live not to forget our past, but to learn from it!&quot;
Steiner: &quot;I may not know who I really am, but that is my question
         alone to answer!&quot;
Dagger: &quot;We may be weak, but that's what makes us work together and
        help one another!&quot;

Garland: &quot;...Then show me! Lecture me again when you are on the verge
         of death!&quot;

[A Silver Dragon drops down and attacks, but gets smoked soon after.]

Zidane: &quot;Garland, tell me... What is it that you want to accomplish?&quot;

Garland: &quot;The restoration of Terra! Isn't it obvious!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;No! That's what the people of Terra want. Why aren't you
        asleep with the rest of them?&quot;

Garland: &quot;I was created to oversee Terra... I exist to wait for a time
         when this world is without life or death... I am the absolute
         controller of this planet!&quot;

[Garland attacks, but is rebuffed.]

Garland: &quot;You fight well...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Give it up, Garland!&quot;

[A weird red aura appears around Garland.]

Garland: &quot;!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What the--&quot;

[FMV. The Invincible flies overhead, its red eye above Garland. You
can guess who's piloting the thing...]

Kuja: &quot;Hahahahaha! This is too easy! The Invincible is mine! Now, I
      have the power to control all souls! Garland gave me everything
      without a fight. The old fool was too busy dealing with him.
      Now, only death awaits him. Poor Garland... Bitten by his own
      dog... This is no accident. Fate has chosen me to become the new
      ruler of Terra! Time for me to put on the finishing touches.&quot;
</pre><pre id="faqspan-12">
[Kuja comes down from the ship to where Garland and Zidane are.]

Kuja: &quot;I must say... I truly love you all. You not only broke the seal
      to Terra, but did me the favor of defeating Garland! Zidane...
      You are truly an extraordinary Genome, deserving of my love!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What are you doing here, Kuja!?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;That's not a very nice way to greet your brother.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Shut up! You're not brother of mine!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Oh, such ferocity... Master Garland, he intends to fight Terra.&quot;

Garland: &quot;Kuja... What are you scheming?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Scheming? Me? Watch me as I defeat these enemies of Terra! Come
      on, now! You may sleep alongside the souls of Terra. For all
      eternity!&quot;

[The party finally gets the chance to whoop up on Kuja...but...he
goes into a Trance and knocks everyone out with a swift Ultima to the
face.]

Kuja: &quot;Yes! This is the power I've longed for!!! The mighty power of
      souls! They assault any threat that tries to destroy them!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wh-What do you mean...?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;It's Trance! You know how it works. But a normal Trance won't
      be enough to defeat you... You're all as resilient as oglops.
      Even tiny moogles possess the power of Trance... When I saw that
      in Gulug Volcano, I came up with a plan. It was easy. I just
      needed to borrow the power from wretched souls that can't die...
      Where did I acquire it? It was the Invincible, or should I say,
      that large eyeball in the sky? The ship sucked up the souls of
      Madain Sari, the Iifa Tree, Alexandria, to feed upon them...
      When it fought Bahamut at the Iifa Tree, the Invicible drew in a
      powerful spirit... Can you guess to whom it belonged?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;!?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Queen Brahne's soul! The soul of your mother! The souls trapped
      inside the Invincible welcomed me with open arms. They were fed
      up with being your prisoners, Garland. So, Master Garland. You
      are no longer needed. And after you've worked so hard... I shall
      rule Terra and Gaia with my unconditional love from now on...&quot;

Garland: &quot;What will you do with such...power?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Master Garland... You, of all people, should accept defeat
      gracefully.&quot;

[Kuja kicks him in the stomach.]

Garland: &quot;Gragh!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;How sad... Any last words?&quot;

Garland: &quot;Your power is...meaningless.&quot;

Kuja: &quot;...&quot;

[Kuja kicks him off the platform, into the darkness below.]

Garland: &quot;GRAAAHHHHHH!!!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Now, it's your turn... Should I kill you quickly to show my
      appreciation for all you've done? Or should I kill you slowly
      and painfully to show you my love... Oh, I've got a great idea!
      How's this? I'll make you pillars for my castle! You'll all
      decorate my castle as a symbol of my eternal kingdom... How do
      you like that?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;No... Never!&quot;

Voice: &quot;You could never build an eternal kingdom...&quot;

Kuja: &quot;That voice... Garland!? Did you leave something behind?&quot;

Voice: &quot;Do you think a defect like you could last forever...?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;...What? What do you mean!?&quot;

Voice: &quot;I built you to last only until the worthy Genome, Zidane, grew.
       It was too dangerous to let you last any longer than that.&quot;

Kuja: &quot;What are you saying...?&quot;

Voice: &quot;There's a limit to your life... You'll be dead soon... Even as
       I die, you'll have died without ever leaving your mark on the
       world...&quot;

Kuja: &quot;... H-Ha ha ha... What an interesting lie. You're telling me
      that my life will end soon? Ha ha ha... Nice try, Garland, but
      I won't fall for your silly tricks... Garland? ... Garland!?
      Answer me!&quot;

Voice: &quot;You were created to destroy. You are a mortal...&quot;

Kuja: &quot;A mortal...? ...I'm finished? I don't believe you! Why would I
      believe such a silly story! You're telling me that I'll die soon,
      now that I'm more powerful than anyone? I'm gonna...die!? Lose my
      soul...? Ha... HAHAHAHAHAHA! What comedy! Zidane, isn't it
      hilarious!? I'll die just like the black mages I so despise! I
      single-handedly brought chaos unto Gaia, but in the end, I'm
      nothing but a worthless doll!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Kuja... ...Kuja?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;...I won't let it happen. I won't... I won't let this world
      exist without me!&quot;

[FMV. Kuja rises up into the air and starts firing his Ultima attack
all over the place, destroying the landscape with ease. Zidane's party
escapes in Kuja's madness.]

Zidane: &quot;Kuja... I can't believe him...!&quot;

Freya: &quot;Zidane! We must escape before the tower collapses!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;But how...? We need to carry the injured out, too.&quot;

Freya: &quot;We must seize that ship Kuja mentioned, the Invincible! It's
       docked at the bottom of the tower.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh yeah... But... Alright, you guys head for the ship!&quot;

Freya: &quot;!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I'm gonna rescue the Genomes! They're victims. I just can't
        abandon them!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I'm coming with you!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dagger!?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I don't want you to leave us again. So, I'll keep watch over you!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Okay. We should be able to go back through the warp gate
        on the other tower! Dagger and I will head back to Bran Bal.
        You guys come get us on the Invincible!&quot;

[Zidane and Dagger head off, coming to a room.]

Dagger: &quot;Looks like a teleporter leading to the upper levels... It
        might take us back to Bran Bal.&quot;

[An eyeball on the wall blinks at Zidane.]

Zidane: &quot;Ahhh!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What's wrong?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;B-Behind you...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;They're just eyes. It's okay. Let's go.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Just eyes...? How very bold of you... U-Um... Dagger?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yes?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Um... About what happened earlier...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What is it, Zidane?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh, geez... I feel like I'm being watched.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Just say it! We need to hurry.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Um... You came to my rescue, right? And... Uh... What you
        said to me... It made me really happy...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;How can I say this...? Um... Thanks...&quot;

[The rest of the party exits via the elevator system.]

Eiko: &quot;Hurry! Hurry! This dinky old tower is gonna collapse any minute!&quot;

Quina: &quot;...I no find good food on Terra. Maybe I eat eyeball over
       there...&quot;

Freya: &quot;Quina, hurry up, or you'll be left behind!&quot;

Quina: &quot;I happy we leave. No good food anywhere...&quot;

[Meanwhile, Dagger and Zidane come through the green hilltop gate.]

Zidane: &quot;I think we're still okay.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Let's evacuate the Genomes!&quot;

[They run through the green gate into town.]

Dagger: &quot;Zidane, let's split up!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah! I'll go this way! We'll split up when the Invincible
        arrives!&quot;

[Dagger and Zidane start talking to the nearest Genomes. Simultaneously,
the party has just entered inside the Invincible.]

Eiko: &quot;My gosh... This ship is enormous!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Judging from our current position, I believe the bridge is
         that way!&quot;

Freya: &quot;Hold it! Where is Quina!?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Aaargh! Is s/he late again!?&quot;

[Quina teleports up on some device.]

Quina: &quot;Ho ho ho! I arrive! I warp inside from bottom of ship!&quot;

Vivi: &quot;Why were you underneath the ship in the first place...?&quot;

Freya: &quot;Save it for later! We must get the ship moving!&quot;

[They all run to the bridge. Zidane goes down into the laboratory and
finds the girl that had led him around before.]

Zidane: &quot;What are you still doing here!? We need to evacuate.&quot;

Girl: &quot;What's the point? They're only empty vessels...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Stop talking like that! Do you really believe what you just
        said!?&quot;

Girl: &quot;...Unlike the rest of them, Garland gave me a soul, that I
      might replace you and Kuja. But Garland is dead. Terra will soon
      be destroyed. What's the point?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I asked myself the same question...&quot;

Girl: &quot;Did you find an answer?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;No... But maybe the point is to just try. It's gonna be
        hard...but I've got my friends. It isn't so bad.&quot;

Girl: &quot;...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, what's your name?&quot;

Girl: &quot;Huh?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Garland gave you a name, didn't he?&quot;

Girl: &quot;My name is...Mikoto.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Mikoto, huh? That's a nice name... A lot of people are gonna
        call you that from now on. You have to find the answer yourself.
        It'll be hard, but you can do it. Let's go to the new world,
        Mikoto! There, you can find your answer...&quot;

[Meanwhile, Freya and Dagger meet up.]

Freya: &quot;Dagger! Where is Zidane!?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;He'll be here any minute! He's looking for the last Genome...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Sorry to keep you guys waiting!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Zidane!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Sorry I'm late. But now we got everyone.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Everyone on board, now! We must leave immediately!&quot;

[They rush onboard. FMV: The Invincible rises up out of Terra amidst
a downpour of flaming debris. The ship emerges out of the planet and
back onto Gaia. Back on the ship:]

Zidane: &quot;We made it...&quot;

Freya: &quot;Yes, we managed to escape from Terra, but...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What's wrong, Freya?&quot;

Freya: &quot;Well, I was talking to Amarant about it earlier...&quot;

Amarant: &quot;You don't think this is the end, do you?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Are you talking about Kuja?&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Do you really think he perished with Terra?&quot;

Freya: &quot;Even with his power, it's hard to believe that he'd have
       escaped unscathed...&quot;

Amarant: &quot;What do you think, Zidane? What will Kuja do next?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...He'll probably try to destroy Gaia...&quot;

Freya: &quot;But how?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;There was one thing Garland said... Something about a tree
        that serves as a gateway of souls between Gaia and Terra...&quot;

Amarant: &quot;That must be...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah... It's the Iifa Tree.&quot;

[Steiner emerges from the bridge.]

Steiner: &quot;Everyone! You must come look! Come with me!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What's up, Steiner? Can't you just tell us?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;It would be faster to come see it on the bridge!&quot;

[Everyone runs to the bridge and sees a hazy view of...clouds?]

Zidane: &quot;What's up? They're just clouds.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;It's not a normal cloud...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What...? Let's lower our altitude and see.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Don't you see? Our altitude is not very high. And this is
         all we can see!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Then what could it be...&quot;

Vivi: &quot;It's Mist... It's what black mages are made out of, and what
      used to cover the Mist Continent...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;The Mist...has covered all of Gaia...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Why...? How...? Kuja... What are you planning now!?&quot;

[Fade to black.]

===========================================================
47. Black Mage Village (BM03)
===========================================================

[The disc opens at the cemetary. Vivi runs to Mr. 288.]

Vivi: &quot;Thanks! They were uneasy at first, but I think they'll get
      along fine.&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;There's no need to thank me. You've done us all
                    a great service.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;It wasn't a big deal... Well, anyway, everything's gonna be
      okay!&quot;

[Vivi runs off just as Zidane walks in.]

Zidane: &quot;Are you sure it's okay for them to stay here?&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;Of course it is. So, this was Vivi's idea?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah... He wanted the Genomes to start their new lives here.&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;We're similar in many ways... Maybe we can
                    understand them better, and they might open up to
                    us.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Right... He also said... If you guys can get along with the
        Genomes, maybe humans and black mages can live alongside each
        other someday...&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;Like you and Vivi...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I don't even know if I truly understood him until recently.&quot;

Black Mage No. 288: &quot;We'll take good care of them. Your friends are
                    our friends.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Thanks...&quot;

[In the stable, Eiko and a genome look at the baby chocobo with its
handler.]

Genome: &quot;Is this a monster?&quot;

Black Mage No. 33: &quot;He's a chocobo, not a monster. He's called Bobby
                   Corwen.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Oh, you gave him a name!&quot;

Black Mage No. 33: &quot;Yeah. Bobby Corwen. Isn't it a great name?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Sounds great! Bobby Corwen, huh?&quot;

[The chocobo moves towards the Genome.]

Genome: &quot;!?&quot;

Black Mage No. 33: &quot;I think Bobby Corwen likes you, too.&quot;

Genome: &quot;It won't bite?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Oh, come on! He's just a little baby chocobo.&quot;

Genome: &quot;!?&quot;

[The chocobo chases the Genome off.]

Black Mage No. 33: &quot;Bobby Corwen! No! Come back here! Wow. I think
                   Bobby Corwen really likes our new friend.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Can't you just call him by his first name...?&quot;

[Quina and a Genome look around the mages' item shop.]

Genome: &quot;Why do you display these items?&quot;

Black Mage No. 163: &quot;Why...? For the customers, I think...&quot;

Genome: &quot;What are customers?&quot;

Black Mage No. 163: &quot;Well, they bring money, and they hand the money
                    over to the shop, and then...&quot;

Genome: &quot;What is money?&quot;

Black Mage No. 163: &quot;Money is, uh...&quot;

Quina: &quot;Why you care about small things? World very simple place.
       World only have two things: Things you can eat and things you
       no can eat.&quot;

Black Mage No. 163: &quot;......&quot;

[Outside, Amarant listens to a mage and a Genome converse by the pond.]

Genome: &quot;Does the water here ever stay still?&quot;

Black Mage No. 87: &quot;...? Water flows, doesn't it?&quot;

Genome: &quot;The water of Bran Bal was always still...&quot;

Black Mage No. 87: &quot;Hey, did you know that time flows, just like water?&quot;

Genome: &quot;So, water and time both flow in Gaia...?&quot;

[Freya walks by.]

Amarant: &quot;......&quot;

Freya: &quot;Looks like they're off to a good start.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Hmph... It's like watching kids play.&quot;

Freya: &quot;It's not their fault... They've only just begun to live their
       lives...&quot;

Amarant: &quot;...Can lost time be recovered?&quot;

Freya: &quot;I don't know... But there's only one thing we can do.&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Of course.&quot;

Freya: &quot;We must protect them from anyone who tries to take their time
       away from them!&quot;

[Dagger and Steiner stand by some villagers at the entrance.]

Steiner: &quot;Princess, is this what you really wish?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Hmm? What are you talking about?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Kuja must have done something in the Iifa Tree to cover
         the world in Mist... Do you not think it wise to consult
         Regent Cid before the final battle?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Kuja probably plans on destroying Gaia. If we go to Lindblum
        now and tell the regent about it, it might cause a panic. I'm
        sure everyone is apprehensive about the reappearance of the
        Mist... I need Uncle Cid to protect Lindblum right now.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Indeed. We must defeat the enemy on our own...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Even if we go back to Lindblum to get equipped, please don't
        tell Uncle Cid about our plans.&quot;

[Zidane walks over.]

Zidane: &quot;Are we ready...?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yes. Let's go.&quot;

Voice: &quot;You haven't got a chance.&quot;

[Mikoto walks over.]

Mikoto: &quot;You saw Kuja's power. He destroyed a world by himself... You
        don't even have a million in one chance of defeating him...
        You'll all die.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Black Mage No. 24: &quot;Wow! This girl knows lots of difficult words!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Doesn't she? She's a bit cynical, but take good care of her,
        will ya? Her name is Mikoto. She's kind of like my little
        sister.&quot;

Mikoto: &quot;Wha--&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Mikoto! Listen to your big brother and make some friends!&quot;

Mikoto: &quot;H-How silly!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;We might be desperate insects to Kuja, but I'll show you how
        powerful we can be.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;'Even a fly lives for a day'!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I don't think that's what Zidane meant...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Let's go to the Iifa Tree! We won't let Kuja have his way!&quot;

[The party heads to the weird ball of light atop the Iifa Tree.]

===========================================================
48. Memoria (MM01)
===========================================================

[FMV. Leagues of silver dragons blow out of the ball atop the Tree...]

Zidane: &quot;They're coming! !?&quot;

[...but cannonfire from Lindblum's Viltgances and such start blowing
them out of the sky like clay pigeons. Onboard the Hilda Garde 3:]

Regent Cid: &quot;All ships, make a path for the Invincible!&quot;

Baku: &quot;Can't let you guys steal the show for yourselves!&quot;

[On the Invincible:]

Zidane: &quot;!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Uncle Cid!? Why...? How did he know to show up here?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Probably because of Baku... He loves big showdowns! Now,
        let's lose those dragons!&quot;

[FMV. The Invincible heads through the dragons into the ball of light,
with more dragons on its tail. The Red Rose divides the two, though,
and the dragons start bashing into the frame, unable to stop in time.]

Kohel, Pluto Knight III: &quot;General Beatrix! Our ship is going to burst!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Do not fret! Your captain is about to enter Valhalla! You
         are a Pluto Knight! Now, act like one!&quot;

Blutzen, Pluto Knight II: &quot;...We all know you came along because you
                          were worried sick about Captain Steiner...&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Did you say something!?&quot;

[The Invincible crew watches the appearance of the Red Rose.]

Steiner: &quot;Red Rose!? Could it be...Beatrix!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Quite a woman, you fell in love with!&quot;

Steiner: &quot;You're one to talk!&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Wait a minute, Steiner! What did you mean by that!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Alright! Let's bust through!&quot;

[FMV. The Invincible pierces the ball of light and a blinding light
encases the area. The party fights a Nova Dragon and beats the living
daylights out of it. In the ship's teleportation room:]

Zidane: &quot;Are you sure this will work, Quina?&quot;

Quina: &quot;Is no problem! I warp in from outside before.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I guess this is the only exit, anyway...&quot;

Quina: &quot;We find same magic field outside when we come back. I warp
       in when I step into magic field outside.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Alright... I guess it's no use worrying.&quot;

[Everyone teleports out, landing on steps up to a castle.]

Zidane: &quot;...What is this place? !?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;What's wrong, Zidane?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Did someone just call my name?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;No.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That's weird...&quot;

Freya: &quot;Maybe you're just hearing things.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I don't think so. !!!? You hear that!?&quot;

Steiner: &quot;...I hear nothing.&quot;

Voice: &quot;...Zidane, can you hear me?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Garland!?&quot;

Voice: &quot;...I am speaking only to you.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Garland, what is this place?&quot;

Voice: &quot;Memoria... A place of memories.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Memories...?&quot;

Voice: &quot;Yes, your memories brought forth this place... Here, you shall
       witness the truth. You have no choice. Now, go...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What are you talking about!? Damn...!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;...Zidane, what's going on?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;You all heard me talking, right? ...Looks like I was the
        only one who heard him. I was just talking to Garland. He told
        me that our memories created this place. I don't know what the
        hell he's talking about... I guess we'll just have to move
        forward.&quot;

[The party heads in and eventually is attacked by the snakish thing
that guarded the Fire Shrine: Maliris.]

Maliris: &quot;We meet again... I am one of the Chaos guardians. Kneel
         before my power!&quot;

[The party wails on Maliris.]

Maliris: &quot;It's over... Take this!&quot;

[Maliris uses Raining Swords and then dies. The party continues on
until they come to a view of a castle.]

Eiko: &quot;Isn't this...Alexandria?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What is Alexandria Castle doing here?&quot;

Eiko: &quot;!!!&quot;
Dagger: &quot;!!!&quot;
Zidane: &quot;!!!&quot;

[Pictures of Bahamut, Alexander, and the Invincible's eye flash by,
and the picture of the castle turns to the current ruined state.]

Eiko: &quot;!!!&quot;
Dagger: &quot;!!!&quot;
Zidane: &quot;!!!&quot;

Quina: &quot;What!? What you talk about!? I not see anything!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Of course you can't see anything. You weren't with us at the
        time, so it's not in your memory.&quot;

[Garland's voice talks.]

Garland: &quot;In his bid to defy me, Kuja tried to acquire Alexander...
         An incident, 10 years ago, started everything...&quot;

[The party continues on into a raining screen.]

Zidane: &quot;A storm...&quot;

[Zidane runs along a bridge and looks down at a girl in a boat.]

Zidane: &quot;!? Hey! What are you doing!? You shouldn't go anywhere!
        There's a storm. Watch out! You're gonna get washed away!
        Dagger! I just saw a little girl in a ship, and-- Huh!? ...I
        guess it was my imagination. Yeah, it had to be. What I just
        saw definitely isn't one of my memories.&quot;

Dagger: (What's going on? That was my memory. Why was Zidane able to
        see it?) &quot;Zidane.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, what's up?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;...You didn't imagine anything.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wait, you saw it, too...!? That means that little girl was
        you. But...why was I able to see something from your memory?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;I don't know...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Hey, Garland! What's going on!? Garland, can you hear me!?&quot;

Voice: &quot;I feared Gaia's eidolons more than anything... However, I
       decided to deal with them before they became a major problem.&quot;

[The party runs into the next screen, where steps lead up into the
Invincible's eye...or, rather, an image of it.]

Zidane: &quot;What is that thing...?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;That eye... It's the same eye I saw on the night of the storm
        at sea.&quot;

Voice: &quot;...Zidane, can you hear me? ...Zidane. What you just saw was
       from your memory, and not Garnet's.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What!? I don't remember ever being in a storm at sea.&quot;

Voice: &quot;You still don't understand... You will find out soon enough...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What do you mean? Can other people's memories become a part
        of my own? Garland!!!&quot;

Voice: &quot;Once you accept everything, the answer will appear before you.
       A tremendous force was summoned to Gaia during the age of war...
       However, the Gaians were not ready to harness so great a power...
       They were terrified and broke the jewel into four pieces...and
       they prayed never to see it again.&quot;

[The party heads up the stairs and is attacked by Tiamat, which was
the guardian at the Wind Shrine.]

Tiamat: &quot;So you have defeated Maliris... For Tiamat, there is only
        victory!&quot;

[Well...not really. Tiamat gets smoked. The party heads on again,
coming to a winding path that shows two planets merging.]

Zidane: &quot;What is this...? Two moons colliding...? No. They look more
        like planets. Why does this look so familiar...?&quot;

Voice: &quot;That is a picture of Gaia being assimilated by Terra. Five
       thousand years ago, Terra, already an old planet, sought to
       assimilate Gaia. Terra needed to merge with a younger planet
       to survive. However, there was already life on Gaia. And so,
       the story began...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Oh yeah. I saw this in Oeilvert.&quot;

Voice: &quot;Life on Terra was coming to an end... We had no choice but to
       proceed with the fusion, which tragically destroyed Terra's
       native civilizations. Terra was too old to assimilate everything.
       Thus, I created the Iifa Tree to regulate the flow of souls back
       to Terra.&quot;

[The party continues ahead, going into a marine-life screen. Quina
swims around.]

Quina: &quot;Wow! We in ocean now! Fish everywhere! Yum, yum!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...What are you doing?&quot;

Quina: &quot;Swimming after fish. Zidane, you help catch fish, too. Ugh...
       What this? Hard to breathe now. UGHHH! CAN'T BREATHE!!!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That's because you think we're inside an ocean. I can breathe
        fine.&quot;

Quina: &quot;We not in ocean? You right! I breathe okay now! Fish all
       gone. I sad...&quot;

[In the next screen:]

Zidane: &quot;So, Gaia used to be just one big ocean...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;How do you know?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...I don't know. For some reason, it's in my memory. I
        wasn't even born at the time. It doesn't make any sense...
        And I was born on Terra, not Gaia, so how can it be in my
        memory...?&quot;

Vivi: &quot;...It's in my memory, too. Gaia used to be covered with water.&quot;

Freya: &quot;I'm getting a similar feeling as well.&quot;

Zidane: (...Maybe that means all existence can be traced back to a
        single source. I don't understand...)

[The party is attacked by Kraken soon after.]

Kraken: &quot;I am the 'Water Chaos' Kraken... Your presence is forbidden!&quot;

[The party fries Kraken and moves on, coming to a room with a large
burning planet as the backdrop.]

Zidane: &quot;Geez... That's one big fireball.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Could it be a moon...?&quot;

Voice: &quot;This is the birth of Gaia.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That's Gaia...?&quot;

Voice: &quot;Over 5,000 years ago...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What's above that ladder?&quot;

Voice: &quot;See for yourself. Terra reached the peak of its prosperity at
       this time. The people believed that their future was secure.
       Ultimately, that very hubris led to Terra's demise. Thus, I was
       created to deal with our plights...&quot;

[The party climbs the ladder and come into a room, where Lich attacks.]

Lich: &quot;I, the 'Earth Chaos' Lich, commend your feat. But your life
      ends now.&quot;

[Zidane walks to the edge of the platform after killing Lich and
almost falls off into space.]

Zidane: &quot;WHOOOA! There's nothing... Is this it? Is there nothing else?&quot;

Voice: &quot;This is space.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Space?&quot;

Voice: &quot;Your journey is not yet over. Do not fear. Step forward, and
       you will be closer to the truth. Go, Zidane...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That's easy for you to say...&quot;

[Zidane walks off and ends up in a shining light.]

Voice: &quot;You have entered a new realm. There are no more worlds. There
       is no more space... Follow your memory, your original memory,
       and march forth...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Garland, what exactly is our memory!?&quot;

Voice: &quot;.........&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Why can I remember other people's experiences and events
        that happened before my time?&quot;

Voice: &quot;.........&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Garland, please! Tell me!&quot;

Voice: &quot;...Do not limit memory to just one individual's experiences
       from birth. That is only the surface. Every life born into this
       world, whether natural or artificial, requires a parent. And
       that parent also requires a parent. Life is connected, one to
       another... If you trace the root of all life, there exists one
       source. The same can be said for memory. All life constitutes
       an intelligence that holds memory beyond experience. Memory is
       not isolated within individuals. It is an accumulation of
       generations of memories that continues to evolve. You can say
       that memory and evolution go hand in hand. But most life-forms
       do not understand the true nature of memories... ...which
       explains why most memories never cross paths.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...So, what am I gonna find by tracing back our roots?&quot;

Voice: &quot;...A presence that presides over all life and memories. The
       crystal...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Crystal...&quot;

Voice: &quot;You are on your own now. Zidane...take care of Kuja. ...and
       protect the crystal. Farewell...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Garland, wait! Garland!!!&quot;

Voice: &quot;Even if I were created to serve one purpose alone, I do not
       regret being born to this world.&quot;

[Zidane ends up in a large crystal world in space.]

Zidane: &quot;Is this the crystal that Garland was talking about...?
        ...It's time for us to find out the truth.&quot;

[The party navigates the world and finds Kuja standing by a crystal.]

Zidane: &quot;!!! Kuja!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Nice of you to come. I'm surprised you beat the 4 Chaoses that
      I created from the crystal's memory. But...you're too late. Take
      a good look. Isn't it beautiful? It's the original crystal...
      This is where it all began... The birthplace of all things...
      Once I destroy it, everything will be gone. Gaia, Terra, the
      universe, everything... Your lives and memories, too, of course.
      HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Shut up!!! The only thing that's gonna be gone is you! I'll
        take you out right now!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Hmph. You honestly think you can beat me? Even if you do, Gaia's
      already doomed. Its assimilation by Terra has begun, and the Iifa
      Tree will incite a cataclysmic destruction of Gaia. It's all over
      for you and your friends. See. I win, either way.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;It doesn't matter! Even if Gaia is assimilated, the planet
        will remain, and we'll start over to make a new home. Kuja,
        you're nothing but a coward! If you're gonna die, leave us out
        of it!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Why should the world exist without me? That wouldn't be fair.
      If I die, we all die! Zidane, you will be my first sacrifice.&quot;

[A surprise attack by Deathguise occurs, but they kill that, too.]

Kuja: &quot;How did they beat Deathguise...? Do you really think you can
      beat me?&quot;

[The party runs to Kuja.]

Kuja: &quot;I can't believe you beat Deathguise... Well...my time is almost
      up. Time to die, everyone!&quot;

[The party beats Trance Kuja, too.]

Kuja: &quot;Ugh... I'm gonna die anyway... I won't have to be afraid anymore...
      But I'm not gonna die alone. You're all coming with me!&quot;

[Kuja uses his Ultima Trance and knocks everyone out. The party wakes
up on some unfamiliar terrain.]

Zidane: &quot;U-Ugh... What happened to the crystal...? ...Where is this?&quot;

Voice: &quot;You stand before the final dimension, and I am the darkness
       of eternity...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wh-Who are you!?&quot;

Voice: &quot;All life bears death from birth. Life fears death, but lives
       only to die. It starts with anxiety. Anxiety becomes fear. Fear
       leads to anger...anger leads to hate...hate leads to suffering...
       The only cure for this fear is total destruction. Kuja was a
       victim of his own fear. He concluded he could only save himself
       by destroying the origin of all things--the crystal.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;What the heck are you talking about? Why are you telling me
        all this?&quot;

Voice: &quot;...Now, the theory is undeniable. Kuja's actions prove it. All
       things live to perish. At last, life has uncovered this truth.
       Now, it is time to end this world.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wh-What do you mean by that?&quot;

Voice: &quot;I exist for one purpose... To return everything back to the
       zero world, where there is no life and no crystal to give life.
       In a world of nothing, fear does not exist. This is the world
       that all life desires.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Who the hell do you think you are!? You're not ending anything!
        Never, not as long as we have the will to live!&quot;

Voice: &quot;Foolish creature... Your fears have already deluded you. One
       day, you will choose destruction over existence, as Kuja did.
       When he sought to destroy the crystal, the purpose of life ended.
       Now, come... Enter the zero world that you desire.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;No! We'll destroy you and prove you wrong! And through our
        memories, future generations will see that we can overcome any
        fear! ...We can't give up now. ...We have to fight together.
        Even if we lose, it doesn't matter... Our memories will live
        on inside others. So, even if we are born to die, I'm not
        afraid. I'm gonna live!&quot;

[The party is then chosen, and the remaining characters will say
their goodbyes (even Zidane can be replaced):]

Amarant: &quot;...Don't screw up.&quot;
Eiko: &quot;Promise me you'll win!&quot;
Dagger: &quot;Please accept my powers...&quot;
Freya: &quot;I leave everything in your hands.&quot;
Steiner: &quot;Though I am unworthy, accept my powers.&quot;
Vivi: &quot;I'm sorry I couldn't do anything. Good luck.&quot;
Quina: &quot;Come back after you kill bad guy. I prepare big meal for everyone.&quot;
Zidane: &quot;We've come too far to lose. If we put our powers together, I know
        we can win.&quot;

[Once the unused party members disappear:]

Zidane: &quot;We've come too far to lose now. Let's just wrap this up
        and go home...all of us.&quot;
Freya: &quot;You don't stand a chance against us! We shall prevail!&quot;

[They battle with the entity (Necron), and they lay a humanity-sized
smackdown on it.]

Necron: &quot;Why defy your fate?&quot;

[The party members teleport out of the Hill of Despair.]

Necron: &quot;Is the will to live that powerful...?&quot;

[Necron starts to go kaboom, crumbling.]

Necron: &quot;This is not the end. I am eternal... ...as long as there is
        life and death...&quot;

===========================================================
49. Memoria Aftermath (MM02)
===========================================================

[FMV. Over the top of the Iifa Tree, Memoria disappears and the roots
rise up and start to retract and shake. The party teleports to the
entrance.]

Zidane: &quot;Are you alright?&quot;

Dagger: &quot;Yeah...but look at what's happening.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;So, what Kuja said was true... The Iifa Tree is beginning its
        violent reaction.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What's gonna happen?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I don't know, but it doesn't look good...&quot;

[Above, the crew of the Red Rose looks on.]

Beatrix: &quot;...I doubt anyone could've survived that explosion...&quot;

Haagen, Pluto Knight VIII: &quot;Nooo...&quot;

Pluto Knight: &quot;Captain...&quot;

Mikoto: &quot;...They are still alive.&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;What!? Where are they?&quot;

Mikoto: &quot;...Over there.&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;The Hilda Garde is probably closer... You. The tall one.&quot;

Haagen, Pluto Knight VIII: &quot;Sir! Haagen, Pluto Knight VIII, ma'am!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;I didn't ask for your name. Contact the Hilda Garde right away.&quot;

Haagen, Pluto Knight VIII: &quot;Yes, sir, ma'am, sir!&quot;

[Haagen runs away. On the Hilda Garde, Cid watches the Iifa Tree, too.]

Regent Cid: &quot;Please be alive...&quot;

Erin: &quot;Sire! We're receiving a transmission from the Red Rose!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Punch it up on the main line!&quot;

Voice: &quot;This is the Red Rose.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;You're not General Beatrix. Who are you?&quot;

Voice: &quot;My name is Mikoto. Everyone is alive. You are very close to them.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;What!!!? How do you know?&quot;

Mikoto: &quot;I can hear him...&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Who? Prepare to land immediately!&quot;

[FMV. The Hilda Garde goes down to pick everyone up.]

Zidane: &quot;That's the Hilda Garde 3... Looks like Cid came to rescue us.
        Cid!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Thank heavens, you're all safe! Come quickly! We don't
            have much time!&quot;

[Everyone starts to leave, with Dagger and Zidane acting as the
caboose. Zidane stops when he hears someone talk--]

Voice: &quot;...Farewell, Zidane...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Ah, dammit...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What's wrong?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Why don't you go on ahead? I'll catch up with you all later.
        I have to take care of something...&quot;

Dagger: &quot;What...!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...He's still alive.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;He can't be...&quot;

[Steiner runs over.]

Steiner: &quot;Zidane! What are you doing!?&quot;

[Everyone runs back over, actually.]

Zidane: &quot;Steiner... Take care of Dagger.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;What!? Wh-What do you mean by that!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...Kuja's still alive. I can't just leave him.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;This is ludicrous. Just because you two are from the same
         planet doesn't mean--&quot;

Zidane: &quot;No, that's not the reason.&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Come on, Zidane! Why are you doing this!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Because... Because I might've done the same thing if I were
        in his shoes. I probably would've fought against you guys and
        wreaked havoc in Gaia like he did... I know it sounds crazy...
        ...but I know, deep down inside, I have to do this.&quot;

Quina: &quot;You not crazy, Zidane. But you go help Kuja not good idea. Is
       too dangerous.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;...I can't just leave him. There's no way I could live with
        myself. I'm going.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;You're making a big mistake!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Maybe... But we all have to make big decisions in life sometimes.
        For me, now's that time. I have to face up to it, just like Vivi
        did when he confronted his fears to find out about himself. That
        was a big decision for Vivi.&quot;

Vivi: &quot;I don't know about that... I don't think it was really a big deal.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;That's what you think, but I might not be doing this if it
        weren't for you. You've definitely taught me to take life more
        seriously.&quot;

Freya: &quot;Well, you're obviously not going to change your mind, so I'm
       coming with you.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;The principle of knighthood requires that one assist his
         comrade in times of need. I shall accompany you as well!&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Whoa, wait a minute. Like I said, it's my moment, so don't
        butt in. You guys'll have your own someday. Besides, you guys
        have more important things to worry about, like Burmecia and
        Alexandria.&quot;

Freya: &quot;For once in your life, why can't you be honest!?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Sorry, but I can't--&quot;

Amarant: &quot;'I can't just walk away. It goes against my nature.'&quot;

Zidane: &quot;!?&quot;

Amarant: &quot;You're a real simpleton. Forget it, guys. There's no stopping
         this fool.&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;What are you still doing out here!? Get onboard right now!&quot;

Amarant: &quot;Come on. Let's just leave him and get outta here.&quot;

[Amarant bolts.]

Zidane: &quot;...That guy will never change. Alright, you heard the man!
        Get out of here before it's too late!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Zidane, I love you! You'd better come back!!!&quot;

[Eiko runs off, frustrated.]

Quina: &quot;Zidane, I need eat more different food. I still hungry!!! You
       need come back, take me more places, show me more food!&quot;

[Quina leaves.]

Freya: &quot;I still can't believe you're doing this. You've changed, Zidane.
       'Til we meet again.&quot;

[Freya follows after Quina.]

Vivi: &quot;Zidane, you've taught me another big lesson in life. Thanks...&quot;

[Vivi hurries off.]

Dagger: &quot;Zidane...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Princess... We must go.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Dagger--I mean, Your Highness. The abduction is over. I can't
        take you any further. ...I'm sorry for being so selfish.&quot;

Dagger: &quot;No... You're not being selfish. ...You've done so much for
        us. If it weren't for you, I probably would've led a meaningless
        life. With you, I was able to see so much of the world and meet
        so many people. We faced many hardships, too...but...I think I
        finally know what's important. I'm so fortunate to have met you.
        I'll never forget our trip together. Thank you, Zidane. ......
        ...... Promise me one thing... Please come back.&quot;

[FMV. The Hilda Garde carries everyone off but Zidane.]

Zidane: &quot;Kuja! Can you hear me!? I'm coming to get you!&quot;

Voice: &quot;You still have time... Forget about me and go.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Just shut up, and stay where you are!&quot;

Kuja: &quot;...I don't understand you.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Okay, here goes nothing.&quot;

[FMV. Zidane runs across the Iifa's flailing roots and heads into the
center of the tree. He rides one root all the way down and has to
start dodging more roots. He falls into a hole and lands past Kuja...
way past, falling down onto his stomach.]

Zidane: &quot;U...Ugh... ...? Phew... Still alive... I guess that was
        pretty crazy.&quot;

[He runs up some roots to Kuja.]

Zidane: &quot;Hey! Are you alright?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Zidane...? What are you doing here? I thought I told you to go...&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Wouldn't you do the same for me if you knew I was dying?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;......&quot;

Zidane: &quot;......Never mind.&quot;

Kuja: &quot;Your comrades were able to escape?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah... I knew you had something to do with it.&quot;

Kuja: &quot;...I'm glad they made it.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;Yeah, well...it's our turn to get movin'.&quot;

Kuja: &quot;...... ...I don't deserve to live after all that I've done. I'm
      useless to this world.&quot;

Zidane: &quot;No one's useless... You helped us escape, remember?&quot;

Kuja: &quot;...... After you guys beat me, I had nothing left...nothing
      more to lose. Then, I finally realized what it means to live...
      I guess I was too late.&quot;

[Kuja's head rolls to the side.]

Zidane: &quot;!!!? Hey! Don't you go dying on me, alright!? !!!?&quot;

[FMV. Tree roots drop down from the ceiling and attack (!?) the spot
where Zidane and Kuja are, with unknown results. Then, later, Mikoto
is shown walking out of the tree, alone.]

Mikoto: &quot;Kuja... What you did was wrong... But you gave us all one
        thing... Hope... We were all created for the wrong reason, but
        you alone defied our fate. We do not want to forget this. We
        want your memory to live on forever... ...to remind us that we
        were not created for the wrong reason--that our life has
        meaning.&quot;

Narrative: Some time later...&quot;

#######################################################################
NOTE:

 I've received a few e-mails on the blacked-out parts that follow this
 announcement. Some seem to think that it's pure Vivi narrative, some
 think that it's Vivi's narrative with Mikoto in it. Personally, I 
 believe that it's each character who's played a role giving a summary
 of what they learned from Zidane. The only thing I can see that would
 make me think differently is that Quina's quote is said correctly, and
 not in broken Qu speak. Vivi's disappearance from the scenes implies
 his death to some, but I never bought it. Sorry. This disclaimer is to
 tell you to believe what you want to believe, I guess.

#######################################################################

[The view is back in Alexandria, at the front of the Morning Star Bar.]

Vivi?: &quot;So, this is Alexandria...&quot;

[Puck runs by and runs into him.]

Puck: &quot;Pick up the pace, will ya!? I don't believe it! Vivi!&quot;

Vivi?: &quot;Vivi? How do you know that name!?&quot;

Puck: &quot;What are you talking about? It's me, Puck! How could you forget
      me!?&quot;

Vivi?: &quot;Puck...?&quot;

Puck: &quot;You know, Puck!&quot;

Vivi?: &quot;Th-The Prince of Burmecia!?&quot;

Puck: &quot;Oh, come on! What's wrong with you? If you're not Vivi, then
      who are you!?&quot;

Vivi?: &quot;I'm...Vivi's son!&quot;

[A whole bunch of more li'l Vivi's walk into the screen.]

Puck: &quot;Yeeeeow! Look at all the Vivis!

[On a blacked-out screen:]

Vivi: &quot;I always talked about you, Zidane. How you were a special
      person to us, because you taught us all how important life is.&quot;

[In Burmecia, Sir Fratley and Freya stand in the fountain plaza. It's
still destroyed, though.]

Sir Fratley: &quot;Freya, you're leaving soon, are you not?&quot;

Freya: &quot;Yes. I can hardly wait to see everyone.&quot;

Sir Fratley: &quot;Alexandria... I went there many years ago. How long will
             it take to rebuilt Burmecia...?&quot;

Freya: &quot;I don't care, as long as I am with you.&quot;

Sir Fratley: &quot;...I love you, Freya.&quot;

Freya: (...Yet he still doesn't remember our past.) &quot;I just want to
       cherish our time right now.&quot;

[On a blacked-out screen:]

Freya: &quot;You taught me that life doesn't last forever. That's why we
       have to help each other and live life to the fullest.&quot;

[In Garnet's room in Alexandria, Beatrix walks in.]

Beatrix: &quot;It's time to say goodbye to this room... Save the Queen, you
         have served me well... My duty is finished here. Farewell,
         Alexandria...&quot;

[On a blacked-out screen, Beatrix (?) talks:]

Beatrix: &quot;Even if you say goodbye, you'll always be in our hearts. So,
         I know we're not alone anymore.&quot;

[At South Gate, on a broken bridge to Treno, Amarant walks.]

Amarant: &quot;...Hey.&quot;

[Lani is there, too.]

Lani: &quot;Why are you going to Alexandria?&quot;

Amarant: &quot;You're not going?&quot;

[He walks off.]

Lani: &quot;I-I never said that! H-Hey,wait!&quot;

[On a blacked-out screen:]

Amarant: &quot;Why I was born... How I want to live... Thanks for giving
         me time to think.&quot;

[In Alexandria Castle's kitchen, Quina walks around.]

Quina: &quot;Good food not only delicious! Good food made with heart! This
       very important when cooking for friends!&quot;

[On a blacked-out screen, Quina's words (with conjunctions!?) appear:]

Quina: &quot;To keep doing what you set your heart on... It's a very hard
       thing to do. We were all so courageous...&quot;

[In the Lindblum Castle lift, Hilda, Cid, and Eiko are riding down.]

Eiko: &quot;Hurry! Hurry! We gotta get there before the play begins!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Ha ha... There's no need to hurry. The theater ship is
            no match for my new ship. My new Hilda Garde is the fastest
            ship ever!&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Do I have to remind you? You said the same thing about the
      theater ship! ...Ahem! That's what you said, Father!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;Eiko... What did you just call me?&quot;

[The lift stops and Eiko runs out.]

Hilda: &quot;Darling, she called you 'Father'...&quot;

Eiko: &quot;Father! Mother! Hurry!&quot;

Regent Cid: &quot;S-Say it again, Eiko!&quot;

[On a blacked-out screen:]

Eiko: &quot;What to do when I felt lonely... That was the only thing you
      couldn't teach me. But we need to figure out the answer for
      ourselves...&quot;

[At Alexandria Castle, a sword-less Beatrix is leaving.]

Voice: &quot;Beatrix!&quot;

[Steiner is standing in the shadows, waiting for her.]

Steiner: &quot;Where are you going?&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Please don't ask. My mind is already set.&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Wait! Listen to me! &lt;Thump-Thump...Thump-Thump...&gt; I, uh...
         I-I never wish to lose you again!!!&quot;

Beatrix: &quot;Steiner...&quot;

Steiner: &quot;Let us protect the queen together!

[Beatrix runs to Steiner and the screen blacks out.]

Steiner: &quot;I'm so happy I met everyone... I wish we could've gone on
         more adventures. But I guess we all have to say goodbye
         someday.&quot;

[In the theater ship meeting room, the Tantalus gang meets up.]

Baku: &quot;Alright, you scumbags! We're almost there!&quot;

Blank: &quot;Been a long time since we saw Alexandria.&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Let's give 'em a show they won't forget!&quot;

Ruby: &quot;Yeehaw!&quot;

Cinna: &quot;Break a leg, people!&quot;

[On a blacked-out screen, someone (Zidane?) speaks:]
</pre><pre id="faqspan-13">
Zidane: Everyone... Thank you... Farewell. My memories will be part of
        the sky...&quot;

[At the throne, Queen Garnet sits. Steiner walks in...and so does
Beatrix.]

Queen Garnet: &quot;The theater ship will arrive any minute. It's been so
              long... I can't wait to see everyone. But... It'll never
              be the same... I have to let go of the past... I have to
              move on, just like he taught me.&quot;

[The play begins. It's 'I Want to be Your Canary', of course.]

Baku: &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen! Tonight's performance is a story that
      takes place long, long ago. Our heroine, Princess Cornelia, is
      torn from her lover, Marcus. She attempts to flee the castle,
      only to be captured by her father, King Leo. Tonight's story
      begins when Marcus and Cornelia decide to run away together. And
      now, Your Royal Majesty, Queen Garnet, Lord Steiner, Lady Beatrix...
      ...noble ladies and lords, and our rooftop viewers, Tantalus proudly
      presents 'I Want to Be Your Canary'!

[Baku leaves and Cornelia (Ruby) runs out, finding a hooded man at
the bottom of the ship's stage stairway.]

Cornelia: &quot;Marcus? Sweet Marcus, I fear I love thee more than I should!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;Princess... Wilt thou be happy, married to a lowly peasant
        such as I?&quot;

Cornelia: &quot;Prithee, call me 'princess' no more! Marcus, wilt thou
          truly cherish me, the king's only daughter? Or is such a
          desire too dear to wish for!? After our nuptials, shall I
          become no more than a puppet? A mindless puppet, never to
          laugh, never to cry? I wish to live my life under the sky.
          At times I shall laugh, at other times cry. For no life is
          more insincere than that lived as a masquerade.&quot;

Marcus: &quot;So much consideration thou hast given it! But worry not! Cast
        away thy trappings of royalty, and I shall swaddle thee in a
        gown of pure love! Never again will I pare from thee! Pray, my
        love, make me thy canary to keep forever in the cage of thy
        bosom! Let us embark on the first ship tomorrow, before dawn
        can tell of our elopement!&quot;

Cornelia: &quot;All my fortunes at thy foot, I lay, and I shall follow thee
          throughout the world!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;No cloud, no squall shall hinder us!&quot;

[Marcus leaves the stage.]

Cornelia: &quot;O, love is the sweetest joy and the wildest woe. All I wish
          is to be by my sweet Marcus's side.&quot;

[Blank peeks at the scene (in-character) from behind a stairwell.]

Blank: &quot;Fie! It shall be war again unless this marriage is stopped.
       Ne'er will I let their plan come to fruition.&quot; [He walks out
       from his hiding spot.] &quot;Good day to ye, Highness.&quot;

Cornelia: &quot;Good day...&quot;

Blank: &quot;Wist thee with Marcus?&quot;

Cornelia: &quot;Marcus!? What news dost thou bring?&quot;

Blank: &quot;This!&quot;

[He punches her in the stomach...]

Cornelia: &quot;Ugh!&quot;

[...and picks her up. Later on in the act, King Leo emerges.]

King Leo: &quot;Where is she!? Where has mine only daughter gone!?&quot;

[Blank walks into view.]

King Leo: &quot;Blank, good man! Hast thou seen Cornelia?&quot;

Blank: &quot;Worry not, Majesty. I shall make sure Cornelia marries Prince
       Schneider. Be thou at ease.&quot;

King Leo: &quot;At ease, sayest thou? How can I rest, not knowing she is
          safe? Could it be...thou hast betrayed me?&quot;

Blank: &quot;Be my troth, sir. I betrayed none other than poor Marcus!&quot;

King Leo: &quot;Thou had the gall to betray thy dearest friend. Wouldst
          thou not betray me as swiftly?&quot;

Blank: &quot;Stay thy hand, I merely...&quot;

[King Leo cuts Blank down.]

Blank: &quot;I merely sought a lasting peace between the two kingdoms!&quot;

[Benero and Zenero run out.]

Zenero: &quot;The traitor is dead!&quot;

Benero: &quot;O, cruel fate!&quot;

King Leo: &quot;You two... Quickly, find Cornelia and bring her before me!&quot;

Benero: &quot;Yes, Your Majesty.&quot;
Zenero: &quot;Yes, Your Majesty.&quot;

[They leave.]

King Leo: &quot;Wretched daughter! How dare she disobey her father's wishes!&quot;

[The next day (in the scene), Marcus stands alone.]

Marcus: &quot;The time for our departure is long past. Where is Cornelia?&quot;

[Cinna walks out.]

Cinna: &quot;Marcus, the ship soon embarks! Board ye this boat alone, and
       peace could come to both kingdoms, as Blank so said. Speak,
       Marcus!&quot;

Marcus: &quot;She told me that she could not live without me.&quot;

[Dawn breaks in the background.]

Marcus: &quot;So, the sun is our enemy, too. The eastern sky grows bright.
        Will we not spread our wings, as yonder birds in joyous flight?&quot;

Cinna: &quot;Hark, Marcus! They cannot wait any longer! The ship departs!&quot;

[Cinna leaves.]

Marcus: &quot;Could she have betrayed me? Nay, ne'er would my love speak
        false. I must have faith! She shall appear if I only believe!
        As the sun lends me no ear, I pray instead to the twin moons!
        I beseech thee, wondrous moonlight, grant me my only wish!&quot;

[Marcus casts off his cloak...and it's Zidane!]

Zidane: &quot;Bring my beloved Dagger to me!&quot;

[FMV. Dagger runs down the stairs to the stage. In the process, she
drops her pendant. She looks at it, but doesn't pick it up. She runs
to the stage and jumps into Zidane's arms. She starts punching him and
then stops as they embrace. Everyone claps, including the little Vivis
and Eiko, Freya, Fratley...Steiner and Beatrix raise the Save the Queen
to the sky... On a blacked-out screen:]

Dagger: &quot;How did you survive...?&quot;

Zidane: &quot;I didn't have a choice. I had to live. I wanted to come home
       to you. So... I sang your song. Our song.&quot;

[FMV. The screen pulls out of a rebuilt Alexandria...and all is well.]

      Do you play cards? My theory is that the first number written
      on the card represents the card's attack power. The third and
      fourth numbers are probably defense power. I still don't know
      what the second character means. Please press ([]) to play a

      Do you enjoy card games? I think I know what the second mark on
      the card means! If your card's mark is P, the battle will be:

                           Your card's [4]PO1
                                    vs.
                        the opponent's 3M[2]9

      The green numbers go against each other.

      - Hobby Info #2 -

      If your card's second mark is the letter M, your battle will

              I'll come help you anytime. After you're done with my

              pretty busy, so try not to keep me too long.&quot;

          R2: &quot;First, I'll go over the battle controls.&quot;
              - Basic Battle Controls 1 -
             (&gt;&lt;)   Confirm.
              (O)   Cancel.
             (/\)   Cycle to the next ready character when the ATB

             - Basic Battle Controls 2 -

             [L2]       Turn the target window on/off.
             [START]    Pause.
             [SELECT]   Turn on/off help.
             &quot;Next, I'll talk about ATB. ATB stands for Active Time
             Battle. Time during battle is managed by the ATB
             System. There are 2 ATB modes: Active and Wait. You
             can select them in the Config Menu.&quot;
             - ATB Mode -
             Active      Always real-time
                         (time never stops during battle).
             Wait        Time stops when you are selecting magic
                         and items.
             &quot;If you're a beginner, I think you should choose Wait.
             Active is for more advanced players. Now, let's go
             over damage points. Numbers and details pop up during
             battle whenever your HP and MP change. Numbers appear
             in 2 different colors.&quot;
             - Damage Points -
             9999     HP change;
                      White numbers indicate damage.
                      Green numbers indicate HP recovery.
             9999MP   MP change;
                      White numbers indicate loss.
                      Green numbers indicate MP recovery.
             - Damage Details -
             Miss      When the attack misses.
             Critical  When you deal greater damage than usual.
             Death     When you get KO'd.
             Guard     When status attacks and elemental attacks
                       have no effect.
             &quot;Finally, I'll give you some tips regarding Order. The
             Order option involves not only the lineup but also the
             battle position. There are 2 battle positions: front
             row and back row.
             - Front Row and Back Row -
             Front Row   You can deal big damage with Attack, but
                         you can also receive big damage.
             Back Row    You can only deal small damage with Attack,
                         but you receive less damage from attacks.
             &quot;You can change this setting with the Order option.
             You can also switch between the front and back row
             during battle, by selecting Change. If you use magic
             or long-range weapons, you can deal just as much
             damage from the back row as you can from the front
             row. In tough battles, adjusting battle positions
             appropriately might save your life. Okay, I think I've
             covered enough battle stuff.&quot;

         R3: &quot;Abilities are special powers that characters possess.
             Using them wisely is the key to victory. There are
             tons of different abilities, but generally, they fall
             into 2 categories.&quot;

             - Types of Abilities -

             &lt;A&gt; Action Abilities:
                   Magic and special moves you can use in battle;
                   consume MP.
             &lt;S&gt; Support Abilities:
                   Special abilities that support you in battle
                   (must equip magic stones to use them).

             &quot;You need MP to use magic and special moves. Maximum
             MP increases as you level up. Support abilities must
             be equipped with magic stones to be functional. Like
             MP, the maximum number of these stones increases as
             you level up. The Main Menu shows 2 numbers for magic
             stones: the remaining number and the maximum number.&quot;

             - Magic Stones -

             Rem. No. (Decreases as you Equip Support Abilities.)
             v
             v
         ( )99/99
               ^
               ^
               Max. No. (Increases as you level up.)

             &quot;To set magic stones on support abilities, select
             Ability in the Main Menu and select Equip. There are
             round slots next to each support ability. The ability
             is equipped if a magic stone appears inside the slot.
             The menu shows which support abilities have been
             equipped.

             - Ability Status -

             &lt; &gt;s       Ability Name; Not Equipped.
             &lt;.&gt;s       Ability Name; Equipped.

             &quot;Now I'll tell you how to learn abilities. In general,
             you have to equip items to learn abilities. Most items
             hold special powers that help draw out your inborn
             abilities. You could say the items work to free your
             latent abilities. Select Equip in the Main Menu to
             check which abilities you can learn from items. The
             abilities you cannot learn are grayed out.

             -Which Abilities Can Be Learned? -

             &lt;.&gt;a  Ability Name; Ability that can be learned.
             &lt;.&gt;s  Ability Name; Ability that can be learned.
             &lt; &gt;a  Ability Name; Ability that cannot be learned.
             &lt; &gt;s  Ability Name; Ability that cannot be learned.

             &quot;Abilities can be used as soon as you equip the item.
             However, they cannot be used once you remove the item.
             To use abilities without equipping items, you must
             learn them by gaining enough AP for each ability. You
             can gain AP through battle.&quot;

             - AP Gauge -

             &lt;.&gt;a Ability Name [3stars]
             &lt;.&gt;s Ability Name [3stars]
                    The character has gained enough AP to use the
                    ability without equipping the item.
             &lt;.&gt;a Ability Name [50/100]
             &lt;.&gt;s Ability Name [50/100]
                    The character must equip the item to use the
                    ability until more AP is gained.

             &quot;Press (&gt;&lt;) in the Status Menu to view all the learned
             abilities. On a final note, each ability requires
             different amounts of AP to learn.&quot;

         R4: &quot;When Trance occurs, the character transforms. Your
             powers increase while you're under Trance. In addition
             to greater attack power, you receive new battle
             commands. It's really amazing how much you can change.
             Here are some facts about Trance:&quot;

             - About Trance -

             1. The Trance Gauge increases as you take hits from
                the enemy.
             2. The Trance Gauge does not increase if you get hit
                by other party members.
             3. If you get afflicted by Zombie, the Trance Gauge
                goes down completely.
             4. When the Trance Gauge fills completely, it's party
                time!

             - Conditions that Stop/Prevent Trance -

             1. End of a battle; Trance Gauge goes back down to
                zero.
             2. During battle; Trance Gauge decreases to zero as
                you take actions during battle.

             &quot;You could say that the origin of Trance comes from
             hostility. The hostile energy of the enemy's attacks
             attacks induces Trance. That's why being attacked by
             your allies can't cause Trance. Also, I heard that
             there is an ability that helps you achieve Trance
             faster. By the way, the Trance Gauge appears both in
             battle and in the Status Menu, which is under the Main
             Menu. Unfortunately, not everyone can achieve Trance.
             I guess it's only for the chosen ones. Or maybe it's
             just a myth. I've never seen anyone achieve it.&quot;

         R5: &quot;During your adventure, you'll run into a lot of
             suspicious-looking things. That's when a Field Icon
             might pop up over your head. Press (&gt;&lt;) when you see
             the icon, and something will happen. Field Icons pop
             up a lot, so stay alert. Also, there are some areas
             where you might not be able to see where you are.
             Whenever that happens, pop out the HERE Icon. Press
             [SELECT] to call the HERE Icon. You can pop out the
             HERE Icon anytime by pressing [SELECT]. Also, you can
             turn on/off the icon in the Config Menu.&quot;

         R6: &quot;You can find our buddies everywhere in this world.
             Talk to them whenever you have any problems. Here are
             some of the things they can handle.&quot;

             - Save Moogle's Functions -

                      and MP; also removes some status effects.
             Mognet   Exchange letters with other people.

             &quot;That's about it. Unfortunately, you won't be able to

             in the World Map, Moguo will come help you. Try not to

             times.&quot;

          R7: &quot;Status refers to a character's condition. There are
              good status effects and bad status effects, so pay
              attention! We'll go over the bad status effects
              first. The following status effects go away when the
              battle is over.

              - Bad Status Effects 1 -

              Confuse   You lose control of your character.
              Berserk   Although strength increases, the
                        character can only attack.
              Stop      The character cannot move.
              Poison    HP gradually decrease.
              Sleep     The character falls asleep and cannot move.
              Slow      The ATB Gauge fills up slowly.

              - Bad Status Effects 2 -

              Heat      The terrible burns cause KO if the
                        character takes any action.
              Freeze    The character becomes frozen and gets KO'd
                        if physically attacked.
              Mini      The character shrinks, which reduces Battle
                        Power and Defense.

              &quot;Now I'll discuss VERY bad status effects that won't
              go away after the battle is over. These effects are
              displayed in the Main Menu.&quot;

              - Very Bad Status Effects 1 -

              Petrify   The character becomes petrified and cannot
                        move.
              Venom     HP and MP gradually decrease, and the
                        character cannot move.
              Virus     The character cannot gain EXP or AP after
                        battle because growth is stunted.
              Silence   The character cannot use magic.

              - Very Bad Status Effects 2 -

              Darkness  The character's vision is impaired, and
                        physical attack accuracy decreases.
              Trouble   The damage one character receives transfers
                        to other characters as well.
              Zombie    Healing items and magic cause damage to the
                        character.

              &quot;Alright, enough of the bad stuff. Let's talk about
              the good status effects.&quot;

              - Good Status Effects 1 -

              Auto-Life  The character revives from KO,
                         automatically, once during battle.
              Regen      HP are gradually restored.
              Haste      ATB Gauge fills up faster.
              Float      The character floats and does not receive
                         Earth damage.

              - Good Status Effects 2 -

              Shell      The damage from magic attacks decreases.
              Protect    The damage from physical attacks decreases.
              Vanish     The character vanishes and cannot be hit
                         by physical attacks; the character
                         reappears if hit by magic.
              Reflect    Magic is reflected back at the caster.
                         (Some magic cannot be reflected.)

              &quot;In addition to these, there are status effects known
              as Doom and Gradual Petrify. Remember this! If all
              your party members incur KO, Stop, Petrify, or Venom
              during battle, it's Game Over! Also, you won't
              receive EXP or AP if you're still under KO, Petrify,
              Virus, or Zombie when the battle ends.&quot;

          R8: &quot;There are a total of 8 Elemental Properties: Fire,
              Ice, Thunder, Earth, Water, Wind, Holy, and Shadow.
              Applying these Elemental Properties to your attacks
              and defense makes battles a lot easier. But your
              enemies can take advantage of them as well, so watch
              out. To apply them, you have to understand their
              natures.

              - Elemental Properties -

              Fire     Effective against ice and undead monsters.
              Ice      Effective against insects, large enemies,
                       and fire and dragon-type monsters.
              Thunder  Effective against enemies near water.
              Earth    Ineffective against flying monsters.
              Water    Effective against fire monsters.
              Wind     Effective against flying monsters.
              Holy     Effective against shadow monsters.
              Shadow   Effective against holy monsters.

              &quot;There is also a Non-elemental Property, which is not
              affected by any elemental property. Did all that sink
              in? It's easy, once you get the hang of it.

          R9: &quot;The official name of the card game is Tetra Master.
              Many people all over the world pay Tetra Master. The
              only way to find out who plays is by challenging
              them. Tetra Master players never back down from a
              challenge. To challenge people, walk up to them and
              press ([]). If you challenge a person who isn't a
              player, he or she will probably just talk to you.
              Okay, here are some basic rules.

              - Tetra Master Rules 1 -

              Select 5 cards in your possession to play.

              - Tetra Master Rules 2 -

              1. Put down a card by your opponent's card.
              2. If the arrow on your card points to your opponent's
                 card, you can win his/her card.

              - Tetra Master Rules 3 -
</pre><pre id="faqspan-14">
              If the arrow on your card faces the arrow on your
              opponent's card, a card battle begins.

              &quot;If your card wins the card battle, you win the
              opponent's card. If your card loses the card battle,
              the opponent wins your card.&quot;

              - Tetra Master Rules 4 -

              If you have to battle 2 or more cards, you can choose
              the opponent's card that you want to battle.

              - Tetra Master Rules 5 -

              The game ends once all the cards are played, and the
              person with the most cards is the winner.

              - Tetra Master Rules 6 -

              The winner gets to take the loser's card(s).

              &quot;Tetra Master has other rules, but I won't get into
              them now. Just give it a try and figure them out for
              yourself.&quot;

         R10 (Moggy): &quot;Gosh, Bro. You sure know a lot.&quot;

             Mogster: &quot;Yeah, I know...&quot;

         R10: &quot;In addition to regular shops where you can buy and
              sell items, there are synthesis shops, where you can
              synthesize items to create new items. All you need
              are 2 items to serve as the base and a few Gil to
              cover labor. The items you need and the amount of
              money you pay vary for each synthesized item. Here
              are some examples.&quot;

              - Synthesis Example -

              The Ogre
              (Required Item 1)  Mage Masher
              (Required Item 2)  Mage Masher
              (Cost)             700 Gil
              Desert Boots
              (Required Item 1)  Leather Hat
              (Required Item 2)  Leather Shirt
              (Cost)             300 Gil

              &quot;If you haven't been to a synthesis shop yet, go
              check out the one in Lindblum. Oh, speaking of
              synthesis, I'll tell you a big secret. Long ago, I
              heard rumors there's a Legendary Synthesis who can
              create the best items. But I don't know where he
              lives or what he looks like...&quot;

         R11 (Moggy): &quot;Gosh, Bro. You sure know a lot.&quot;
             Mogster: &quot;Yeah, I know...&quot;

 Steiner: &quot;What a huge town! I'm completely lost.&quot;

 [Steiner sees a red mage approaching.]

 Steiner: &quot;Pardon me...&quot;

 Female Red Mage: &quot;Geez... You're dressed awful funny.&quot;

 Steiner: &quot;...I am Captain Adelbert Steiner of Alexandria, and I
          humble request your assistance to get back to the castle.&quot;

 Female Red Mage: &quot;Ha-ha-ha! That's a new one! Nice try, but I
                  don't date bums. You should really scrape all
                  that rust off. It's disgusting.&quot;

 [She leaves.]

 Steiner: &quot;Wha...?&quot;

 [He sees an old woman at a food cart staring at him.]

 Steiner: &quot;Huh?&quot;

 Grandma Pickle: &quot;Do you always strike out that badly? I think you
                 need a new line. A little shine wouldn't hurt,
                 either.&quot;

 Steiner: &quot;What are these things?&quot;

 Grandma Pickle: &quot;They're called gysahl pickles. They're one of
                 Lindblum's delicacies. Do you wanna try one?&quot;

 Steiner: &quot;...It smells terrible!&quot;

 Grandma Pickle: &quot;The worse the smell, the better they taste.&quot;

 Steiner: &quot;I guess I'll try one. !!! UGHUAAA!!! &lt;HACK-HACK!&gt;&quot;

 Grandma Pickle: &quot;Oh, my. Even the locals don't eat them in one
                 bite.&quot;

 Steiner: &quot;Phew... But you're right. They are good.&quot;

 [Vivi heads into the item shop.]

 Vivi: &quot;Wow, this nut smells really good. I think I'll buy one...
       This place has a lot of unusual things. Is this food? It
       looks good. It looks like the sesame buns Grandpa used to
       make.&quot;

 [He looks at a sign.]

 Sign:            = Alice's Item Shop =
          Festival of the Hunt Sale ends today!

 Vivi: &quot;Wow, there's gonna be a festival! Hi. I wanna buy this.&quot;

 Alice: &quot;Oh, are you friends with the moogles?&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;Huh?&quot;

 Alice: &quot;That item is called a Kupo Nut. Kupo Nuts are moogles'
        favorite food.&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;Oh. I didn't know that.&quot;

 Alice: &quot;I think that's the last one... Go ahead, honey. It's on
        me.&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;Really!? Thank you!&quot; [He gets the Kupo Nut.] &quot;Um, what is
       this Festival of the Hunt like?&quot;

 Alice: &quot;Well, we let a bunch of animals loose and...&quot;

 Vivi: (Oh, there's gonna be a lot of animals.) &quot;It sounds like fun!
       Thank you!&quot;

 [Vivi runs out.]

 Alice: &quot;What's so fun about fighting savage beasts...? Wait a
        minute! Did I say 'animals' again!?&quot;

| Steam Engine \____________________________________________________

 [Steiner walks along a long pathway.]

 Steiner: &quot;I'm lost again... Where is the princess? The town is
          big, the castle is big, why does everything have to be so
          big!? Pardon me. Can you tell me where I am?&quot;

 Grandpa: &quot;What, you're lost? Gee... You're a soldier, for cryin'
          out loud. This is the bridge that connects the castle and
          the airship docks. That big building in front of us
          houses the docks.&quot;

 Steiner: &quot;Wh-What is that large airship!?&quot;

 Grandpa: &quot;Amazing, isn't it? It's the Hilda Garde 2. Since it is
          equipped with a steam engine, developed by the regent
          himself, it can fly without Mist.&quot;

 Steiner: &quot;Impossible. How can it fly without being powered by
          Mist?&quot;

 Grandpa: &quot;What cave did you just crawl out of!? This is the age of
          steam power! The source of steam power is water. It's
          much safer than Mist. Heh-heh-heh! A bright future awaits
          us all!&quot;

 [The old man walks away, and Steiner stares dumbfounded upwards.]

 Dagger: &quot;...A bell's ringing... A performance in the Theater
         District must've just ended.&quot;

 Elite Guard: &quot;Is there anything you need, Your Highness?&quot;

 Dagger: &quot;No, thank you. I'm thinking of going outside and having a
         look around.&quot;

 Elite Guard: &quot;I'm sorry, Your Highness, but we cannot grant this
              request. Right now, there are many people coming to
              Lindblum for the Festival of the Hunt. Therefore,
              things are quite chaotic in town, making security
              rather difficult. Also, very few people know of your
              presence here. It's for your own safety. Please
              understand.&quot;

 Dagger: &quot;Okay, I understand...&quot;

 [The guard walks away.]

 Dagger: &quot;...I can't stand sitting around like this. I didn't come
         here to be protected. I just want to help Mother...&quot;

 Baku: &quot;A-CHOO!&quot;

 [Cinna drinks from the spring.]

 Cinna: &quot;Phew, that tasted good! I can't believe we found a way out
        of Evil Forest before it got petrified!&quot;

 Marcus: &quot;...It's all thanks to our bro, who pointed out the river
         before he took the map to Zidane. What do we do now, Boss?
         We gotta save our brother...&quot;

 Baku: &quot;Yer right. But first, we'll let the guys outside drink some
       water from the lake. Cinna, bring them over. Hey, about
       Blank... I think it's better that Evil Forest stays
       petrified...&quot;

 [Cinna runs off.]

 Marcus: &quot;Are you serious!?&quot;

 Baku: &quot;Don't get me wrong. I ain't sayin' this out of concern for
       our safety.&quot;

 Marcus: &quot;Then...why?&quot;

 Baku: &quot;I'm sure he wouldn't wanna be saved if it it meant Evil
       Forest was gonna be restored, too...&quot;

 [Cinna returns, without any of the wounded.]

 Marcus: &quot;...You're right.&quot;

 Baku: &quot;We gotta start lookin'. There's gotta be another way to
       cure his petrification somehow. We ain't too late. We gotta
       do what we can.&quot;

 Marcus: &quot;I gotcha, Boss!&quot; [He runs off.]

 Baku: &quot;...... Hey, Cinna... What are you doing over there?&quot;

 Cinna: &quot;This springwater might make some good coffee! I'll get the

 Baku: &quot;Do I gotta remind you what happens to members who don't

 Mario: &quot;The nobles pushed us around, right, Sis!?&quot;

 Natalie: &quot;That's right. They hogged all the waterfront property
          and forced us up into the hills.&quot;

 Mario: &quot;They exploited us to make their money, right, Sis!?&quot;

 [Marcus walks by, taking a moment to listen.]

 Natalie: &quot;Right. But we can't just sit here and complain, or we'll
          end up spending the rest of our lives in this miserable
          place.&quot;

 Mario: &quot;Power to the people! Right, Sis!?&quot;

 [He runs off when Dagger runs down the stairs after him.]

 Dagger: &quot;Which way did he go...? I can't believe I was
         pickpocketed!&quot;

 [Dagger runs off in the wrong direction.]

 Four-armed Man: &quot;Wow, I couldn't see her very well in the dark
                 before. She's a real cutie. Good girls shouldn't
                 be walking around alone at night. It's time for me

 Dagger: &quot;This is not a very nice city... Better find Supersoft

 Drunk: &lt;Burp...&gt;

 Dagger: &quot;......&quot;

 Drunk: &lt;Burp...&gt;

 Dagger: &quot;Ah... Um... Maybe not this way. Yeah, I won't find
         Supersoft over there.&quot;

 Drunk: &lt;Hiccup!&gt;

 [Dagger walks in the direction away from the drunk, seeing a man
 standing near the waterfront.]

 Dagger: &quot;Oh... Excuse me, have you heard of a thing called
         Supersoft...?&quot;

 Old Man: &quot;Huh? My wife? She died 3 years ago.&quot;

 Dagger: &quot;No, I'm looking for an item that cures all
         petrification...&quot;

 Old Man: &quot;Oh, really? I'm doing fine, thanks for asking. I may be
          old, but I'm still healthy.&quot;

 Dagger: &quot;...... Um, thank you...very much.&quot;

 Old Man: &quot;You're still young! Don't give up! Good luck!&quot;

 Baku: &quot;ACHOO!!! Yer late.&quot;

 Marcus: &quot;A lot happened. I'm kinda tired.&quot;

 Baku: &quot;No excuses. You're ready to go.&quot;

 Marcus: &quot;You found it? You found the Supersoft?&quot;

 Baku: &quot;Yeah, in a noble's mansion. You'll go by boat and break in

                     He's aware, just like us.&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;Th-Thanks... Um... What are you all doing here?&quot;

 Black Mage No. 288: &quot;We escaped together from Alexandria and the
                     cargo ships.&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;This far!?&quot;

 Black Mage No. 288: &quot;That's right. We wanted to live in a world
                     where there were no humans. To do that, we had
                     to cross the ocean.&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;I see... So... Um, what's this?&quot;

 Black Mage No. 56: &quot;This is a...uh... What's the word...?&quot;

 Black Mage No. 288: &quot;It's a cemetery.&quot;

 Black Mage No. 56: &quot;Right. A cemetery.&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;A cemetery...? So... Underneath the ground--&quot;

 Black Mage No. 288: &quot;Yes, our friends are buried under there...&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;But...why?&quot;

 Black Mage No. 288: &quot;That's because...&quot;

 Black Mage No. 56: &quot;I...I came here with Mr. 36. We escaped
                    together. We had so many things to learn. It
                    was really scary at first, but we helped each
                    other. Then one day, Mr. 36 stopped moving. He
                    just stopped... Wouldn't move or say anything.
                    My friend who knows lots of things told me this
                    was what 'death' was, and we had to bury him.
                    Mr. 36 is buried under the ground now. But I
                    don't understand why. He's going to come out
                    again one day, right? When he does, I'm going
                    to wash him off in the pond.&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;Wh-What's he talking about...?&quot;

 Black Mage No. 288: &quot;......&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;Was it a disease? Or was he hurt?&quot;

         me didn't bring me any joy. Mother imprisoned me...used
         the eidolons she stole from me as tools of war. I thought
         I would kill my eidolons if Kuja was going to use them for
         war... But now they're gone... I feel like I've lost a

 Eiko: &quot;Thanks for cleaning! You guys did a great job! A clean
       house worthy of hosting my hero, Zidane! But here's where
       the real challenge begins! I don't think Zidane and Dagger
       are dating, yet. Dagger has been slow to catch on to
       Zidane's moves. That means there's plenty of time for me to
       get between them! I'm gonna cook lots of yummy food and show
       Zidane what a good homemaker I am!&quot;

 Mocha: &quot;Kupo! It might work if you cooked good food.&quot;

 Momatose: &quot;But Eiko screws up a lot when she cooks. We don't have
           much food in stock right now...&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;I know! That's why I can't screw up. You're all gonna help
       me.&quot;

 Mocha: &quot;NO!&quot;

 Chimomo: &quot;Kupopo...&quot;

 Momatose: &quot;Kupo... I'm sleepy!&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;You're all gonna help! I'm gonna cook my specialty: rock-
       -fisted potato stew!&quot;

 Momatose: &quot;Kupo. Yeah, that's delicious.&quot;

 Mocha: &quot;But the last one you made tasted so bad, I thought my
        pompom would fall off...&quot;

 Chimomo: &quot;Just stew?&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;Yeah, I think I need another dish. What do you guys think?&quot;

 Chimomo: &quot;Kupo. How about some fish? Fresh fish tastes great
          barbecued.&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;...... That sounds good! Okay, our menu is rock-fisted
       potato stew and barbecued fish! Let's see... Who should do
       the fishing? {Chimomo/Mocha/Momatose}

 [Eiko makes her choice.]

 Eiko: &quot;Go, _______!

 Eiko: &quot;Who should dig up potatoes?&quot; {Options = unchosen moogles}

       R2 --&gt; Start over

       R1: &quot;Let's start!&quot;

       cook for Dagger, too. And all you guys: Mog, Moco, Mocha,
       Chimomo, Momatose, and Morrison! Will you put water on for
       all the people I listed? I'll get the ingredients.&quot;

 Moogle: &quot;Um... How many people do I need to account for, kupo?&quot;

 [The player selects the number.]

 Moogle: &quot;___ people! Kupo!&quot; {Pour Water / Think Again}

 [If you put in too much water, the moogle with the kettle'll say:]

 Moogle: &quot;Water spilled over! Kupo?&quot; [You'll have to try again.]

 [When you're done:]

 Eiko: &quot;Potato, potato (note) Pumpkin bomb (note) Lots and lots of
       nuts (note) Should I put in that oglop I found on the Conde
       Petie Mountain Path?&quot; {Yes/No}

 [Eiko turns to her helper.]

 Eiko: &quot;Thanks! Let's start! Get the water goin' (note) A good
       shake o' salt (note) Potato, potato (note) Pumpkin bomb
       (note) Another shake o' salt! (note) Lots and lots of nuts
       (note) An oglop for seasoning (note)&quot;

 [The oglop line is left out if you didn't put it in. Anyway, the
 moogle fishing will yell, then (I chose Momatose):]

 Moogle: &quot;I caught one! Kupo! It's heavy... Kupo!&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;Are you okay!?&quot;
       R1 --&gt; Tell him to let it go
       R2 --&gt; Let (Moogle helping cook) cook, and lend a hand

       R1: &quot;______! Let go of that one and catch another one!&quot;

           Moogle: &quot;Kupo!&quot;

       R2: &quot;Keep stirring, _______. Don't let it burn! ...This is
           big! We'll pull it together on 3, okay? 1! 2! 3!&quot;

           [The party pulls up Quina.]

           Both: &quot;AAAAAAHHH!!!&quot;

 [If you didn't pull up Quina, just then, Eiko will look at her

          Eiko: &quot;NOOOOOO!&quot;

          Quina: &quot;I teach you very important lesson in cooking.
                 'Always make more than you need.' Maybe more
                 people show up. Maybe your guests very hungry. You
                 correct to make food for more than 10 people! This

       they feel about one another until they're apart.&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;...What do you mean?&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;Aaargh! You big dope! Okay, listen carefully. Zidane really
       likes Dagger. But Zidane wants to act cool, so they
       misunderstand each other and end up fighting. Now do you
       understand?&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;...Not really.&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;Zidane wouldn't stop acting cool in front of me, either.
       It's so hopeless... Hey, what's that? Is that the card
       stadium?&quot;

 [She runs off.]

 Vivi: &quot;H-Hey, wait...! ...She's gone.&quot;

 Marco: &quot;I never expected to run into you again.&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;Um, thank you very much for your help to the airship.&quot;

 Marco: &quot;Hey, no worries. My master is a good man. Anyone else
        would've refused. You should thank my master. He's the one
        who agreed to take you to Alexandria for free.&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;Yeah...&quot;

 Marco: &quot;So, how was the play? Did you like it?&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;Y-Yeah.&quot;

 Marco: &quot;Wasn't there an accident during the show? Were you okay?&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;Oh, um... Well, yeah, I was okay.&quot;

 Marco: &quot;Good! Well, I gotta get back to work. Hey, don't you live
        near Treno?&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;Yes, I do...&quot;

 Marco: &quot;Your family must be worried. Go home soon! See ya!&quot;

 [Marco leaves.]

 Vivi: &quot;...But Grandpa's gone. Hmm...&quot;
       R1 --&gt; Stop by at home
       R2 --&gt; Stay in Treno

       R1: &quot;Well, since I'm so close to home, I might as well stop
           by.&quot; [He leaves.]
       R2: &quot;I wanna see more of Treno.&quot; [He stays.]

 [Natalie and Mario survey the east slums.]

 Natalie: &quot;Trapped in the slums... Living only to earn tomorrow's
          wages... The working class can't find meaning in life...
          If that's how they want to live their lives, so be it...
          But I'm not going to spend my life here in the slums!
          What I want is power! Power enough to rule the masses! Do
          you understand, Mario?&quot;

 [Mario's talking to a hippo kid.]

 Natalie: &quot;......&quot;

 Hippo: &quot;Check it out! I got the Namingway Card the other day.&quot;

 Mario: &quot;That's awesome, Hippo! You can take anyone on with the
        Namingway Card!&quot;

 Hippo: &quot;OH, but you're a much better player than me, Mario.&quot;

 Natalie: &quot;Mario! You can't become a ruler if you waste your time
          playing games!&quot;

 Mario: &quot;But Sis, you said that the card game is a tool of the
        nobles to show off their economic power...&quot;

 Natalie: &quot;That's right. Since it's a barometer of social status,
          it can also be a way to improve one's status. ! Yes!
          That's a great idea! Hippo! Is Mario a skilled card
          player!?&quot;

 Hippo: &quot;Mario is the best player in our neighborhood.&quot;

 Mario: &quot;Tee hee.&quot;

 Natalie: &quot;Good! Now, I need to ask you a favor. If you agre, I'll
          make you our top servant when we become nobles!&quot;

 [Vivi walks by.]

 Hippo: &quot;U-Um... Okay, if it's for you, Natalie.&quot;

 Natalie: &quot;Listen carefully...&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;...... Wow, everybody's thinking hard about how to live his
       or her life... I gotta try harder...&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;What happened, Amarant? That guy was totally frightened!
       Oh, I know! You were being a bully, weren't you?&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;......&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;My grandpa always told me that bullies are actually
       cowards.&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;Just leave me alone... ......&quot;

 Four-armed Man: &quot;Hee hee... So he's traveling with a kid... I

 Young Nobleman: &quot;How wonderful! I bet it's gorgeous.&quot;

 Nobleman: &quot;Indeed, it is. I had to add a room to my mansion for it!

 Noblewoman: &quot;Oh, my...&quot;

 Nobleman: &quot;Everything costs so much!&quot;

 Young Nobleman: &quot;I was also thinking about buying a behemoth
                 statue for our mansion.&quot;

 Nobleman: &quot;Everything costs so much!&quot;

 Nobleman: &quot;Ha ha ha...&quot;
 Noblewoman: &quot;Tee hee hee...&quot;
 Young Nobleman: &quot;Ha ha ha...&quot;

 [Eiko had been listening to their talk. The four-armed man stalks
 her and stays out of sight behind a pillar.]

 Eiko: &quot;Hmm... I guess city people have their problems, too. I

 Eiko: &quot;Hey... What are you doing?&quot;

 Four-armed Man: &quot;H-Hello, little girl...&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;Oh, you're the one who was being pushed around by Amarant.&quot;

 Four-armed Man: &quot;Ha ha ha... D-Don't be silly!&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;So? What can I do for you, Mr. Wimpy?&quot;

 Four-armed Man: &quot;...Alright. Hey, are you new here?&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;Uh-huh. I'm sightseeing.&quot;

 Four-armed Man: &quot;Hey, why don't I show you around?&quot;&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;No thanks. I'm fine by myself.&quot;

 Four-armed Man: &quot;W-Wait!&quot; (Dammit, why do I gotta deal with this
                 brat? I just need to nab her and get even with

 Eiko: &quot;Dinner?&quot;

 Four-armed Man: &quot;That's right! What would you like to eat? Treno

 [Quina (!?) walks out of the synth shop just then.]

 Quina: &quot;You say you have delicious food?&quot;

 Four-armed Man: &quot;Yeah, lots of delicious... Huh!?&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;Hey, Quina.&quot;

 Quina: &quot;You say you have lots of delicious food?&quot;

 Quina: &quot;I want delicious food.&quot;

 Freya: &quot;Oh, it's you, Amarant. What are you doing? Looking at the

 Amarant: &quot;I thought you'd be the quiet type...&quot;

 Freya: &quot;Sorry. Maybe I've changed. It's probably his influence.&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;Zidane, huh...? So... Did you find what you were looking
          for?&quot;

 Freya: &quot;Well, I've been investigating Kuja... Some people seem to
        think that King, the owner of this mansion, is Kuja. True,
        I found people who witnessed Kuja on this property. But
        there is no proof that Kuja is Lord King.&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;Hmph.&quot;

 Freya: &quot;...What do you know?&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;Nothing, really...&quot;

 Freya: &quot;Maybe I can find out the truth from the mansion's
        auctioneer...&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;Don't hold your breath.&quot;

 Freya: &quot;So, what's your story? You seem to know your way around.
        Are you also here for a reason?&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;Who, me? I'm only an unemployed security guard.&quot;

 Freya: &quot;Security guard?&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;It was painfully dull...until the day he showed up.&quot;

 Freya: &quot;?&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;...I've said too much.&quot;

 Freya: &quot;Hey, wait!&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;What, you're interested in hearing about my past?&quot;

 Freya: &quot;Your past, huh...?&quot;
        R1 --&gt; Of course I'm interested
        R2 --&gt; I won't force it out of you

 Amarant: &quot;This was where he and I met for the first time...&quot;

 Freya: &quot;Who is 'he'?&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;...Zidane.&quot;

 Freya: &quot;I thought the two of you just met!&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;I don't think he remembers. I was working as a security
          guard at this mansion... I was looking for a fight... It
          didn't matter who, as long as he was strong...&quot;

 [Flashback time.]

 Voice: &quot;THIEF!!!&quot;

 [A young(er) Zidane runs out of a door.]

 Zidane: &quot;That was too easy! Wh-who are you?&quot;

 [...he says when Amarant blocks his exit.]

 Amarant: &quot;You look like a worthy opponent...&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Hmph. So you're the King family's infamous new security
         guard, huh?&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;What if I am? Hasn't got me any action yet. Come on,
          fight me.&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Hmph. So you're just a thug.&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;What did you call me!?&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;My favorite kind! I'll knock you out in one minute, flat!

 Amarant: &quot;Don't disappoint me.&quot;

 Voice: &quot;Where did that thief go!?&quot;

 [Two guards run out.]

 Zidane: &quot;Hee hee... Here they come.&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;I won't let them interfere... Come on!&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Don't be silly. The game's over!&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;What!?

 [Zidane runs to the guards.]

 Amarant: &quot;!?&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;H-Help! He came out of that door as I was passing by! I
         was staring at him 'cause I thought he might be a burglar,
         then he started pummeling me!&quot;

 Guard: &quot;But he's a guard for this mansion...&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;That's why he's suspicious! Just look at him!&quot;

 Guard 2: &quot;W-We always had our suspicions, but...&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;I'm gonna call the police! You guys hold him off until
         they get here!&quot;

 [Zidane starts to run away, but drops a piece of advice en route.]

 Zidane: &quot;(I'll tell you one thing... The truly mighty ones don't
         flaunt their power. How can I describe it to you? The sly
         eagle hides its claws.)&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;Hmph...&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;(I'm outta here! Buh-bye!)&quot;

 [Zidane bolts.]

 Guard: &quot;W-We've got you now!&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;...Yeah, right.&quot;

 Guard 2: &quot;H-Hey!&quot;

 Guard: &quot;Don't run away!&quot;

 [Amarant doesn't run; he strolls away. The flashback ends.]

 Freya: &quot;S-So, you...&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;I became a wanted man...&quot;

 Freya: &quot;Ha... Ha ha ha...!&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;What's so funny?&quot;

 Freya: &quot;Sorry. I just didn't expect you to fall for such a
        childish trick...&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;...It's no concern of yours.&quot;

 Freya: &quot;I'm sorry. I see, so that's what happened.&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;Don't get me wrong. I don't hold a grudge against him.
          But I need to understand him... He doesn't flaunt his
          power. He only cares about being with his friends...&quot;

 Freya: &quot;You were destined to meet each other again. 'Two men
        walking on the same path are destined to confront each
        other one day.' That's what a man told me some time ago...
        Honesty is a virtue. That's if you can manage to stay

 Eiko: &quot;Hmm... It was okay.&quot;

 Tot: &quot;Do you prefer your own village?&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;Yeah... But it's fun to meet different people. I've only
       had my moogles 'til now.&quot;

 Tot: &quot;Just the moogles...? What about the others?&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;They're gone... I'm all alone now.&quot;

 Tot: &quot;I see... So you are the sole survivor of the summoner
      tribe...&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;Why does everyone wanna know about my horn and the
       eidolons?&quot;

 Tot: &quot;Oh, I'm a researcher of sorts... I'm just curious.&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;I see... Oh yeah, you were Dagger's teacher, right?&quot;

 Tot: &quot;Well, yes.&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;Teach me how to become a graceful princess like her!&quot;

 Tot: &quot;Ha ha... The princess used to be a rambustious girl, just
      like you.&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;Do you think I can be like her when I grow up?&quot;

 Tot: &quot;Oh, of course...&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;I'm glad to hear that! You see, Dagger gave me her 'mark
       of the princess'!&quot;

 Tot: &quot;The mark of the princess...?&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;Yeah! Dagger gave me one of hers. Now she's got two and
       I've got two.&quot;

 Tot: &quot;Do you mean...the legendary crystals!?&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;Yeah. That's what Dagger called them, too.&quot;

 Tot: &quot;I-I see... So the crystal was divided. One piece remained in
      Alexandria, while the others were sent to Cleyra, Lindblum
      and... The summoner tribe took the last piece to Madain
      Sari... But why did they have to split the crystal? What
      happened 500 years ago to prompt such an action...? ......
      Ah! Excuse me. I'm sorry. I get lost in my thoughts
      sometimes. Miss Eiko?&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;...Mog is calling me... Mog wanted to talk to a moogle she
       met in Treno, so I left her there, but something's wrong! I

Quina: &quot;What!? This is food!?&quot;

Grandma Pickle: &quot;You've never seen a pickle before?&quot;

Quina: &quot;No, first time. I still need eat many different food and
       get much learning. My master tell me so.&quot;

Grandma Pickle: &quot;In that case, you should try one. I think you'll
                like it.&quot;

Quina: &quot;Okay! I Eat!&quot;

[S/he starts to munch on the pickles.]

[Baku walks by Grandma Pickle's Business District stand.]

Baku: &quot;AAH...ACHOOO!!!&quot;

Grandma Pickle: &quot;Well, if it isn't Baku.&quot;

Baku: &quot;Grandma, good to see you're still alive.&quot;

Grandma Pickle: &quot;Hey, I stand in front of these smelly pickles
                everyday. It'll take a lot more than that to end my
                life.&quot;

Baku: &quot;Gwahaha! You'll live to be a hundred.&quot;

Grandma Pickle: &quot;Oh yeah. I've been meaning to talk to you.&quot;

Baku: &quot;What is it?&quot;

Grandma Pickle: &quot;One of your boys, Zidane, told me to collect the
                money he owes me from you. His friend ate one of my
                pickles without paying.&quot;

Baku: &quot;WHAT!? Why do I gotta pay!?&quot;

Grandma Pickle: &quot;He said you'd take care of it. That'll be 100 Gil.&quot;

Baku: &quot;I'm gonna wring his neck!&quot;

[Baku goes on the warpath.]

 [Baku and his men gather 'round the hideout front.]

 Baku: &quot;How are the repairs comin'?&quot;

 Cinna: &quot;They're going really slow.&quot;

 Marcus: &quot;We can't rush 'em, or everything will probably fall apart
         again.&quot;

 Zenero: &quot;We're not gettin' anywhere.&quot;

 Benero: &quot;I've been up here forever. I wanna switch places with
         someone.&quot;

 Baku: &quot;I guess the damage is a lot worse than we expected.&quot;

 [Steiner rounds the bend.]

 Baku: &quot;Huh...?&quot;

 Steiner: &quot;She's not here, either... Where could she be...?&quot;

 Baku: &quot;Yo!&quot;

 Steiner: &quot;!!!? Oh, it's only you. Why are you all gathered here?
          Are you scheming another abduction or something?&quot;

 Blank: &quot;Hey, watch your mouth.&quot;

 Cinna: &quot;We were just discussing ways to restore this district.&quot;

 Zenero: &quot;Yeah.&quot;

 Marcus: &quot;Old timer, you've got us all wrong.&quot;

 Benero: &quot;Yeah.&quot;

 Baku: &quot;We're just tryin' to rebuild our home. That's all. What are
       you doin' here? From the looks on your face, it seems like
       you got problems. What's troublin' you? Maybe we can help.&quot;

 Steiner: &quot;Err... Can I really trust you?&quot;

 Baku: &quot;Yeah...&quot;

 Steiner: &quot;...The princess is missing. She is not in the castle, so
          I figured she would be in town.&quot;

 Baku: &quot;Why don't you go back to the castle before you get lost?&quot;

 Steiner: &quot;What!?&quot;

 Baku: &quot;We'll find her. This is like our backyard. Alright, you
       heard me. Get movin'!&quot;

 [The Tantalus boys run off.]

 Steiner: &quot;You...have my gratitude.&quot;

 Baku: &quot;Hey, no prob.&quot;

 [The regent walks into the ship-manufacturing docks.]

 Regent Cid: &quot;How is the ship coming along?&quot;

 Engineer Zebolt: &quot;Regent! You're human again!&quot;

 Regent Cid: &quot;Yes. Now we can concentrate on building the ship.&quot;

 Engineer: &quot;Judging by our experience with Hilda 2, we are almost
           finished with the engine. We're having problems with the
           construction of the hull, though.&quot;

 Regent Cid: &quot;Yes... I'm thinking about sing parts of the Blue
             Narciss for the body.&quot;

 Engineer: &quot;How come?&quot;

 Regent Cid: &quot;I realized that the Blue Narciss was a well-built
             ship when I rode in it. There are other reasons, but
             we must hurry. I already have a completed blueprint in
             my head. Do as I tell you and it will be completed in
             no time. Let's get ready!&quot;

 Engineer Zebolt: &quot;Roger!&quot;

 [Quina runs into the meeting room.]

 Quina: &quot;Aiya! What big stone! Why you all watch stone? Is stone
        edible? Or is for barbeque? No answer... I think I lick it.
        You no answer, so you no mind, right? Hmmm... Is very
        salty. Oh? Who that? What you doing here, Zidane?&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Huh? Oh... Hi, Quina.&quot;

 Quina: &quot;You stand here say nothing, then you just like other
        dummy-dummies. No can tell difference! They say someone
        always has double somewhere. There so many of you here! The
        world strange place, no?&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Yeah, I guess...&quot;

 Quina: &quot;Zidane, what matter? You no seem yourself.&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Hmm? Oh, it's nothing. I'm always myself. Besides, it's
         not just me. You look just like your master, too.&quot;

 Quina: &quot;Of course! Master Quale of Qu Clan! We same!&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Yeah? I guess everybody looks the same to someone from
         another race.&quot;

 Quina: &quot;Hmm... Maybe you right. What he say? Same...race?&quot;

 [Quina turns around, but Zidane's already walked off by himself.]

 [Vivi walks around town, trying to talk to the Genomes.]

 Vivi: &quot;Excuse me...&quot;

 Genome: &quot;...&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;So, umm... What do you guys do here?&quot;

 Genome: &quot;...&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;Hmm... Oh, yeah... This blue light sure is pretty, isn't
       it?&quot;

 Genome: &quot;...&quot;

 [Zidane walks up behind Vivi.]

 Vivi: &quot;You like it, too, right? You're all looking at the blue
       light.&quot;

 Genome: &quot;The light is unpleasant to us...&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;Oh...really...&quot; (Huh? It's that girl...) &quot;Hmm? Hey,
       Zidane... What are you up to?&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;What do you mean? What are you doing, Vivi?&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;I'm trying to talk with the natives. This boy here seems to
       be my age and everything...&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;You're wasting your time. They won't give you a decent
         answer.&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;Oh... But I think I can get through to them.&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Huh. I'm surprised you feel that way.&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;I don't know why, but... I...I feel like we're similar.&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Similar? What do you mean? I know they're similar like
         me, but...&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;No, no... Not like that. They're a lot like the black mages
       we saw on the cargo ship, and in Cleyra. Of course, we don't
       look alike at all. But I can see one thing. Their minds
       aren't hollow. I think that their minds are just out to
       lunch for a little while...&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Hmm... Not hollow, huh?&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;Hey... Where are you going, Zidane?&quot;

 [Zidane walks off.]

 Vivi: &quot;Zidane?&quot;

 [Zidane walks with the mysterious girl to the town's gate.]

 Girl: &quot;This way...&quot;

 [She disappears into the green aura that blocked Zidane before.]

 Voice: &quot;Hey, Zidane!&quot;

 [Amarant walks by.]

 Zidane: &quot;What do you want?&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;What? That's no way to say hello. What the hell is this
          place? I thought we'd find some mean mothers down here,
          but they're all a bunch of wimps.&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;No challenge, huh?&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;Yeah, I guess not.&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Hey, Amarant... Can I ask you something?&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;No.&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Do you...have any parents or family?&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;What a stupid question.&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Sorry. I was just curious.&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;I don't remember any loving parents. My first memory is
          of the face of a guy I had to fight. I only found meaning
          in life through combat.&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Funny how you put that in past tense. All due to my
         wonderful influence.&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;Pshhh. What do you want me to do? Thank you?&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Please! You're gonna make me sick!&quot;

 Amarant: &quot;How about you?&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;What? You mean my parents? ...I don't have parents.&quot;

 [Zidane walks with the girl on the path past the green aura-gate.]

 Zidane: &quot;Hey! Where are you taking me?&quot;

 Girl: &quot;I told you. You are going to see Garland.&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Yeah, of course. But this way is a dead end.&quot;

 Girl: &quot;There is a way. See? You may find him through the portal.
       He awaits where the souls sleep. The floating castle, where
       souls bide their time until their restoration... Pandemonium
       Will you not say farewell to your friends?&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;I don't care what I am... I was born here, wasn't I? If
         so, then I am an enemy to the people of Gaia.&quot;

 Girl: &quot;You learn quickly.&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Make no mistake. I won't join your side. I just... If we
         are actually relatives, then... Then I want to take care
         of this little family matter myself.&quot;

 [He walks into the gate.]

Alleyway Jack: &quot;Huh? How did you know my name? If you know who I

               me to teach you? Well... Why not? I finished one job
               already. Follow me, kid!&quot;

 [They go to the Morning Star Bar.]

Alleyway Jack: &quot;We'll start with the basics. You need 5 cards to
               play the card game. To play a game, approach someone
               and press ([]). Some people may not be interested;
               in that case, move on to someone else. Do you
               understand now?&quot;
               R1 --&gt; How do you play the card game?
               R2 --&gt; How does the card game proceed?
                R2a --&gt; What's a card battle?
                R2b --&gt; What's a combo?
                R2c --&gt; What's a perfect?
                R2d --&gt; What's a collector's level?
                R2e --&gt; Can we try a game?
               R3 --&gt; I think I understand

               R1: [He repeats what he first said in the bar.]

               R2: &quot;Let's talk about how to actually play the game.
                   You take turns placing your cards on a 4x4 grid
                   with your opponent. Sometimes your opponent's
                   card flips. That's because of the yellow arrows
                   on the corners and the sides of the cards. If
                   your arrow is facing in the direction of your
                   opponent's card, that card becomes yours. But if
                   your opponent's card has an arrow facing yours,
                   a card battle begins.

               R2a: &quot;When several arrows face each other, multiple
                    card battles may occur. You can choose where to
                    begin the card battle when that happens. Where
                    you choose to begin the battle affects how the
                    rest of the battles play out. Let's see... You
                    can also use combos.&quot;

               R2b: &quot;Okay, I'll teach you the technical stuff now!
                    You gotta be careful during a card battle. If
                    your card wins against the opponent's card, all
                    the cards facing that card's arrows are yours.
                    That's called a combo. It's a double-edged
                    sword, because the same thing happens to you if
                    your card loses against your opponent's card!
                    Try to play a perfect game!

               R2c: &quot;What is a perfect game, you ask? You get one
                    of your opponent's cards when you win. If you
                    flip over all of your opponent's cards and play
                    a perfect game, you can take all of them! Reach
                    for the highest collector's levels!&quot;

                   also just aliases, of course. You wanna know my

                Good Omen
                A nice day to relax and put your mind at ease.
                Lost things will be returned to you, and you will
                eat foods that are gentle to your body.
                A good day to spend indoors or out!

                Good Omen
                A good day filled with many of life's simple
                pleasures.
                A nice breeze will greet you as you step out. You
                will make new friends and replace a lost item with
                a new one.
                Be yourself and let good fortune come to you.

                Good Omen
                Today will be a day filled with deja vu.
                You will see familiar sights and eat foods that you
                tasted long ago. You may even find a long-lost
                friend.
                Take a moment to recall good memories.
                Your lucky color for today is &quot;red&quot;!

                Very Good Omen
                An auspicious day for you to go out and have fun!
                You'll find lots of money and lost items. You'll
                also eat lots of yummy food, and meet interesting
                people.
                Go out and share your luck with the ones you love!

                Bad Omen
                There are good days, and there are bad days.
                You may be prone to injury or sickness today. Be
                careful of losing items and meeting strangers.
                You are better off staying home today.

 Pasty Yacha: &quot;A boy? I don't know what you're talking about!&quot;
 Bratty Marin: &quot;A...boy? I didn't see any boy!&quot;

 Snot-nosed Gudo: &quot;I wonder if it runs and stuff.&quot;

 Pasty Yacha: &quot;We don't have to work the farm because of them.&quot;

 Bratty Marin: &quot;Chocobo, choco choco chocobo(note)&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;A well would lead underground, but I can't fit through

 Dolf: &quot;It was bad. I think it'll take a while to repair it.&quot;

 Dolf: &quot;The great thing about the festival is you get to take time

 Elena: &quot;I made a traditional Festival of the Hunt dish. I don't
        know if it's good, but I made plenty of it!&quot;

 Marsha: &quot;Hey, don't you think my papa's cool? He rides in an
         airship called the Viltgance.&quot;

 Locke: &quot;Air cabs are amazing. Back in the old days, we had to walk
        all the way to the Theater District. I don't think I could
        ever walk that far anymore. I'd probably croak if I did.&quot;

 Soldier: &quot;This is the Hunter's Gate. You can enter Lindblum by
          foot here or through the Dragon's Gate. Normally, we keep
          the Dragon's Gate closed because it's under the Mist,

 Wayne: &quot;Stop nagging! We've got a customer!&quot;
 Torres: &quot;When is he gonna get it through his head...?

 Torres: &quot;He has potential, but he doesn't work hard enough.&quot;

 Wayne: &quot;My dad means well, but he gets on my nerves sometimes. I
        think the bottom line is he doesn't want me to take over
        the shop.&quot;

 [If you talk to Wayne at the counter:]

 Wayne: &quot;How's it goin'? Do you want me to make you something for

         R1: &quot;NO! Putting it in the back is more effective! Putting

             less power!&quot;

         R2: &quot;That's right! You're a smart guy! Nobody believes

       R1: &quot;Welcome back, kupo! I knew you'd get the hang with

           ability to seek out treasures and items hidden
           underground. But I can't ride chocobos. Will you help
           me, kupo? 60 gil per game, and you keep all the items

       R7: &quot;Ask me again if you feel like trying later, kupo.&quot;

 NOTE: After viewing the 'big secret' option and playing the game
       once R1 changes to 'Play Chocobo Hot &amp; Cold,' which looks

 Mene: &quot;It's 60 gil per game, kupo!&quot; (Current Funds: _ _ _ _ _)

       discoveries! I'll double the points from here! I'll give you
       10 extra seconds! Good luck, kupo!&quot;

 [When you dig up a 'Stone With Patterns':]

 Zidane: &quot;What's this Stone with Patterns?&quot;

 Mene: &quot;Can I see? Kupo? ...There's a picture of some location on
       the stone, kupo. This place must have tons of treasures...
       Why don't you go out of the forest and look for this place?
       Kupo? It's free of charge, of course. Go outside and press
       (/\) while you're riding on Choco to choose which stone you
       want to find, kupo. You can dig with ([]). I've got an idea,
       kupo! Let's call this stone 'Chocograph' from now on.&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;...Chocograph?&quot;

 Mene: &quot;I think Choco's been searching for something all his life.
       There must be tons of treasures, kupo! You might find some
       cards, so you should leave some room in your card inventory,
       kupo!&quot;

 NOTE: Finding a Chocograph lets Choco have a new option in-forest,
       where you can view the ones you have so far. Minor thing.

 [After getting Mary to talk to Jeff:]

 Part-time Worker Mary: &quot;...I really liked your store. It had a
                        nice atmosphere, a lot of sunlight, and a
                        nice sign. But what made the store really
                        special for me was... The real reason I
                        went to your store was...&quot;

 Jobless Jeff: &quot;Who is this girl?&quot;

 Part-time Worker Mary: &quot;This is my first time talking to him! I
                        wish I'd done it sooner.&quot;

 Steiner: &quot;I cannot climb like this.&quot;

 Steiner: (I must act natural!)

 Steiner: (I must get rid of them before I go into the alley.)

 the map of the area to her.]

 Steiner: &quot;...M-Miss Dagger. The gate we just crossed is called
          Bohden Gate. And we are here, at Bohden Station, still
          inside Lindblum. South Gate itself is inside Lindblum
          territory, but... ...the cable car will take us over the
          Aerbs Mountains into Alexandria. And this is Treno Gate,
          which is where we are heading. Treno, the City of Nobles,
          should not be too far from there.&quot;

 Wei: &quot;Oh, Kal!&quot;
 Zidane: &quot;It's too dangerous to stay here. You have to escape to

                       R2: &quot;The Berkmea cable cars were built 8

                           engines, invented in Lindblum. The cars
                           work by pulling on each other. When one

            I feel so sad when I see Mary, the part-time worker.
            Have you ever fallen in love? I've never fallen in love
            before, kupo. If watching someone else in love is so
            difficult, I wonder how difficult it is to actually fall
            in love myself?

            Nazna: &quot;I'm never gonna fall in love! It's just not
                   worth it...&quot;

 [After Marcus and Cinna arrive, Dagger can talk to them. Depending
 on which one she talks to first, the convo will be:]

 Dagger: &quot;You're Marcus, right? What are you doing here?&quot;

 Cinna: &quot;Hey, check it out! It's the princess.&quot;
 Marcus: &quot;When we escaped from Evil Forest...&quot;

                  R1 --&gt; What do you need to play the card game?

                  R2 --&gt; Cancel

                  R1: &quot;You need 5 cards to play the card game!
                      Approach someone and press ([])! Some people
                      may refuse, though! The Card Stadium is a
                      special place! You can play against many
                      different players once you enter the stadium!&quot;

                  R1a:&quot;You play on a 4x4 grid! You place cards,
                      alternating with your opponent! Sometime's
                      your opponent's card will flip over! Check
                      the yellow arrows on the edge of the cards!
                      When the arrow points to your opponent's
                      card, and it flips over, that card is yours!
                      Watch out, though: if your opponent's card
                      has an arrow pointing at your arrow, there
                      will be a card battle! The number that
                      appears on the card is the card's power! The
                      number decreases during battle, and the card
                      with the higher number remaining wins! When
                      several arrows point at each other, multiple
                      card battles occur! In that case, you can
                      choose where to begin the chain of card
                      battles! Plan carefully: how one battle ends
                      will affect the subsequent battles! You can
                      also utilize combo techniques!&quot;

                  R1b:&quot;What is a combo, you ask? When you flip an
                      opponent's card, you can also flip over the
                      cards where your opponent's arrows are
                      pointing! But if your card loses the battle,
                      your own cards can work against you to flip
                      over more of your cards! That's the power of
                      combos! Get a perfect score using combos!&quot;

                  R1c:&quot;When you win a card game, you'll receive one
                      card from your opponent... ...but if you flip
                      over all of your opponent's cards and score a
                      perfect game, you receive all of your</pre><pre id="faqspan-19">

                  R1d:&quot;Open 'Card' from the menu to check your
                      collector's level! Your level increases as

                      title is unknown, because no one has ever

             Grimo, in South Gate's Bohden Station, sent me a
             letter saying he feels sad when he sees Mary in
             love... ...but I think he feels that way becaus Grimo
             himself is in love. Kupo... Am I right?

             Mochos: &quot;Hmm. I also know that Nazna is in love with
                     Grimo...

 Mene: &quot;...You're right, kupo. But why...? Oh!!! Legend was true,
       kupo! I'll tell you a secret. I'm looking for paradise on

 Zidane: &quot;What's this Chocograph Piece?&quot;

       There's something carved on the back. It's faded, kupo...
       I'll put it in Key under your Item Menu. Take a look, kupo.
       I think you're supposed to collect the pieces until you

 ____________________________________________/CL02 -- Kildea's Tour |

 [Forest Oracle Kildea takes the party on a Cleyra tour, showing
 them the waterwheel and a small pond first.]

 Forest Oracle Kildea: &quot;This is our source of water. I shall
                       elaborate later on how we have water up so
                       high here. Now for our next stop.&quot;

 [She shows them an inn/square.]

 Forest Oracle Kildea: &quot;And this is the liveliest part of our town.
                       But there's no market today, so the usual
                       crowd is gone... Let's move on.&quot;

 [She shows them the windmill 'complex' up further.]

 Forest Oracle Kildea: &quot;This windmill brings the blessings of water
                       to our humble town. It uses the power of the
                       sandstorm to pump water up from the ground.
                       Come. Next, I shall show you the observatory.

 [She shows them a lookout point.]

 Forest Oracle Kildea: &quot;The observatory is where the citizenry
                       comes to relax. Here, we observe our
                       protector, the sandstorm, and here, we pray
                       to it. Next is the cathedral, the last stop
                       on our tour.&quot;

 [Up at the cathedral:]

 Forest Oracle Kildea: &quot;The High Priest, who brings peace to our
                       souls, resides in the cathedral. The king of
                       Burmecia and Lady Freya are meeting inside
                       this building. It also houses a harp whose
                       magic stone powers the sandstorm. Let us
                       make our way back.&quot;

 [They walk back to the entrance.]

 Forest Oracle Kildea: &quot;And that concludes the tour.&quot;
 Zidane: &quot;Thanks a lot!&quot;

                       I do not recommend provoking it.&quot;

 [By not taking the tour, Kildea will say before the antlion line:]

 Moon Maiden Claire: &quot;The sandstorm that protects our town is
                     powered by magic. To keep the storm in motion,

 Sun Oracle Florin: &quot;In days of old, the folk of Cleyra and

                    fled to this tree to avoid conflict with the
                    Burmecians, who began to value the arts of
                    war.&quot;

 Wind Maiden Eileen: &quot;Burmecian are like us Cleyrans, in that both
                     societies value dance. Our tradition, however,
                     is older. Thus, our dances evoke greater power

           Kupo! What's goign on in Alexandria!? Soldiers are

           returned to Alexandria! Princess Garnet left the castle,
           I guess she still believes in Queen Brahne!&quot;

                 thinking? Kupo! I don't understand how the royal
                 family thinks...&quot;

 NOTE: The last sentence in Kupo's letter changes depending on if
       Garnet said she believed the queen or not. The one where she
       has faith is already listed; the one where she's skeptical

 [You can find a Ramuh manifestation at the crash site:]

 Ramuh: &quot;Historian's explanation:
        Although Joseph's death was not reported to his daughter,
        the manner of his death speaks for itself. This is the
        story of a true hero. That's 'Hero.' You have __ to go.&quot;

 [You can find a manifestation in the screen with Monty, to the NW]

 Ramuh: &quot;Once upon a time, 33 small countries fought together
        against an empire. One day, a rebel troop visited a man
        named Joseph, who lived with his daughter. Owing a debt to
        the troops, he gladly accepted their plea for help. They
        headed for a cavern in the snow field. That's 'Beginning.'
        You have __ to go.&quot;

 [You can find a manifestation in the same screen as Monty, half-
 -hidden in the water.]

 Ramuh: &quot;Historian's explanation:
        The fact that they didn't report Joseph's death to his
        daughter is indicative of their guilt for failing to
        protect him. In the end, heroes are also human. That's
        'Human.' You have __ to go.&quot;

 [You can find a manifestation in a screen left of where Monty is.]

 Ramuh: &quot;With Joseph's help, the troop defeated the adamantoise in
        the snow field cavern and acquired the Goddess Bell they
        needed to enter the empire's castle. That's 'Cooperation.'
        You have __ to go.&quot;

 [You can find a manifestation behind the screen with 'Cooperation']

 Ramuh: &quot;On their way home, they fell into a trap set by a traitor.
        Joseph gave his life to save the troop. The troop left
        without telling Joseph's daughter, Nelly, about the
        tragedy. That's 'Silence,' the last piece.&quot;

 [Afterwards:]

 Justin: &quot;H-Hey! Don't talk to me! You'll blow my cover! I'm the
         leader of the Vigilantes! Is that so? That's what Nicole
         thinks... But this is my cause. I can't turn away from it.
         This is what I believe in, no matter how much pain it may
         bring. I won't stop... I'm gonna fight for my cause! Even

 Engineer Gabin: &quot;I can't believe the Industrial District got wiped

 Devon: &quot;KILL! KILL! KILL! Those voices are stuck in my head! Black

 Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;Owning an airship fleet no longer determines
                      who wins a war. Black mage soldiers and
                      eidolons are the ultimate weapons of mass

 Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;There was no need to take things this far.
                      I pledged my loyalty to Queen Brahne in order
                      to protect Alexandria. Not to kill people.&quot;

 Lindblum Officer: &quot;This is where I witnessed the Industrial
                   District disappear. I bet everyone's dead. The
                   eidolon swallowed everything.&quot;

 Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;Oh, I can't believe I'm standing next to Mr.
                      Lowell...! I'm so happy &lt;3&quot;

 Lowell: &quot;Even a big star like me can't make a living without a
         theater. Hey pal, do you know any other theaters I can
         work at?&quot;
 Zidane: &quot;Yeah, this girl named Ruby runs a small theater in
         Alexandria.&quot;
 Lowell: &quot;Oh, buddy, is that right? I'm too big of a star for a
         sleepy town like Alexandria, but that's okay. I'll share
         my talent with those uncultured people.&quot;
 [Lowell runs off, with the starstruck soldier chasing after him.]
 Alexandrian Soldier: &quot;Oh, don't go!&quot;
 Zidane: &quot;Ruby and Lowell, huh? What a strange pairing of actors.&quot;

        can leave us here. Go take care of the bad guys.&quot;

 Lucella: &quot;I thought you were one of them people with pointy hats!
          Is Uncle Baku coming home soon? It wouldn't be so scary

 Stiltzkin: &quot;What the heck is this place!? It's like a maze!&quot;

 Treasure Hunter: &quot;Are you here for the treasure, too?&quot;
 Zidane: &quot;Treasure? What are you talking about?&quot;
 Treasure Hunter: &quot;You don't know? This excavation site has tons of
                  treasure and rare fossils. You're not here to
                  steal them?&quot;
 Zidane: &quot;No, we're not treasure hunting. Does this tunnel connect
         to the Outer Continent?&quot;
 Treasure Hunter: &quot;The Outer Continent? You're trying to go outside?
                  Huh... This tunnel's like a web. I don't even
                  know how far it travels. You'll need to go that
                  way, but it's quite a trip. The only way to go
                  further is to hitch a ride on the gargant. But
                  it'll lead you to a dead end if you let it go
                  wherever it wants. So you navigate the gargant
                  with that switch over there.&quot;
 Zidane: &quot;What's the relationship between the switch and the
         gargants?&quot;
 Treasure Hunter: &quot;The switch changes which fountain the water
                  water comes from. Gargants hate water. You can
                  block off the sections you don't want to go to by
                  activating the fountain with that switch. That
                  over there is the No. 2 switch. You'll need to
                  trigger it to go over to the other side.&quot;
 Zidane: &quot;I see... How do I get there?&quot;
 Treasure Hunter: &quot;Do I have to tell you everything...? You can get
                  there on a gargant, but... ...you'll need to
                  trigger the No. 1 switch to do it.&quot;
 Zidane: &quot;I see. Thanks for the info.&quot;

 Treasure Hunter: &quot;The northern side leads to a dead end. There's
                  open road to the southwest. If you're going
                  southwest, follow the numbers on the switching
                  system. No. 1 is at the deep end of the north
                  side. Oh, and the treasure here is all mine. You
                  can't take it.&quot;

 Sign: The current number of couples who, having received the
       blessings of the sun and the heavens through the authority
       of Father David, have visited the sanctuary.

          R3: &quot;You're looking for a forest with black mages? That's
              gonna be a little tough to find. To the south of this
              swamp, there's a huge forest surrounded by mountain
              ranges. It's called Magdalene Forest. Once you get
              there, open the menu to check if you're in the right
              forest. If you go deep in the forest, you'll
              eventually run into a place that you can go inside.
              What was that again? 'A forest so thick that even
              owls can't live there.' Sounds like you might get
              lost. But those mages are pretty clumsy, so I'm sure
              there'll be signposts or something you can follow.&quot;

 Dagger: &quot;I'm a little tired.&quot;

 [After talking to Vivi:]

 Vivi: &quot;I'm gonna stay here and think about it some more.&quot;

 [If you try to enter the kitchen area:]

 Morrison: &quot;Kupo. Please wait. Lady Eiko says it'll be a while
           before she is done cooking. I will call you when it is
           done.&quot;

 [After viewing ATE 'Eiko's Feelings':]

 Dagger: &quot;I feel so anxious...&quot;

 [If you try to go down the path to the right of the fountain:]

 Moco: &quot;This is a restricted area!&quot;
 Zidane: &quot;Restricted? What's that, then?&quot;
 Moco: &quot;Kupo!?&quot;
 [Quina walks on a high wall.]
 Quina: &quot;Zidane, this place only rocks and sand. I eat star sand
        once, but sand here not food. Water look clean.&quot;
 [Quina jumps into the water stream.]
 Moco: &quot;Squee...!!!&quot;
 Zidane: &quot;Hey, don't take it so hard. S/he is a special case.&quot;

 [Afterwards:]

 Moco: &quot;Restricted...access, kupo.&quot;

 [If Zidane walks back from the restricted area to the square:]

 Zidane: &quot;Geez... What a dump. It must've been like this for at
         least ten years. What can Eiko possibly feed us?&quot; [The
         ATE 'Eiko's Feelings' plays.]

 [After Morrison says he'll take you to the Eidolon Wall, you can
 try to enter the kitchen:]

 Mog: &quot;KUPOOO! Kupo kupo kupo!&quot; [Last three kupos repeated on any
      further attempts to get in kitchen.]

 [If you talk to Morrison after you say you'll go get Dagger:]

 Morrison: &quot;I'll be waiting.&quot;

 [After Dagger is taken to the Eidolon Wall:]

 Dagger: &quot;I don't know most of these eidolons.&quot;

 Morrison: &quot;The summoner tribe honors nature. They named this world
           Gaia. They considered the eidolons guardians of this
           planet. They attempted to become one with nature through
           their summon night research. The tribe migrated to this
           location 500 years ago. But now...&quot;

 [After Eiko asks Zidane to clear the table:]

 Dagger: &quot;There are so many old books here. I think this one is
         Lord Avon's 'Wishing Upon a Star.' Can you believe this?
         This is a first edition! I've only ever seen one at the
         castle library! Why does she own books that are more than
         500 years old...?&quot;
 Dagger: &quot;I don't think there are any books on summoning.&quot;

 [In the kitchen:]

 Moogle: &quot;This person keeps telling me to catch more fish... Kupo.&quot;
 Quina: &quot;Zidane, I make great discovery! These fish different from
        Mist Continent fish!&quot;

 Quina: &quot;Catch another one!&quot;

 [After Eiko tells you the Iifa Tree is sealed:]

 Zidane: &quot;Eiko, will you break the seal for us?&quot;
 Eiko: &quot;Wh-What!? No way!&quot;
 Zidane: &quot;It's not like we're gonna do anything bad... Well, I'm
         sure we can handle it on our own.&quot;
 Eiko: &quot;No way! Are you crazy!?&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;...You won't do it?&quot;
 Eiko: &quot;...No.&quot;

 [In the dining room, there is a &quot;?&quot;:]

 Narrative: There's something written on the wall. Eiko, 3 years
            old. Mog, 3 years old. Same age!

 Moco: &quot;Eiko and her people protected the Eidolon Wall for
       generations. We moogles also help Eiko protect the wall.
       Don't mess it up!&quot;
 Zidane: &quot;Where are all the other people of her tribe?&quot;
 Moco: &quot;...I can't tell you.&quot;

 Moco: &quot;Don't mess it up!&quot;

Morrison: &quot;It's not much, but I found some goods for your journey.
          I hate to say it, but our village could use some capital.

             A kid named Vivi came to the Black Mage Village. His
             eyes were so sad... Like he had the weight of the
             world on his shoulders, kupo. I wanted to say &quot;Good
             luck!&quot; to him, but I couldn't... Kupo. I'm on your
             side, Vivi!

             Mocchi: &quot;Sad eyes? Weight of the world? Is that very

 Zidane: &quot;Machine? What do you mean, 'machine'?&quot;
 Dagger: &quot;Well, it sure doesn't look like any normal tree.&quot;
 Zidane: &quot;Yeah. It's weird enough that the inside of a tree looks
         like this.&quot;

 Dagger: &quot;It looks like it's been here for ages. A hundred, two
         hundred years or more...&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;You can see some sparkling water down below. It's really
       pretty. Maybe the Mist comes from that water down there? So,
       if the Iifa Tree is the source of the Mist...&quot;
 Vivi: &quot;What could that sparkle be?&quot;

 Eiko: &quot;Mog is a little scared. So, that sparkling water is a
       living thing? It's so pretty. Hey, Zidane! Come watch it
       with me.&quot;
       R1 --&gt; Alright
       R2 --&gt; No thanks

       R1: &quot;Really!? Okay, come here!&quot;
           Zidane: &quot;But... I can see it fine from here.&quot;
           Eiko: &quot;No! It has to be romantic! Hehehe...&quot;
           Zidane: &quot;Eiko, you're not watching the sparkle, are you?

 Chimomo: &quot;They were born on the same day, but Eiko came out first.

               started a new business here, filled with hope, but
               the people of this city didn't accept me... Why? Why
               can't I sell oglop goodies in Alexandria!?

               Alexandria is still a hick town. Maybe my business
               is too hip for this place. I'm moving to Lindblum!
               In Lindblum, my dreams will become reality!

 Mayor Kapu: &quot;What do you mean!? We reserved a room at 100 Gil for
             3 nights!&quot;
 Fish Man: &quot;U-Um, no, it's actually 100 Gil per night...&quot;
 Mayor Kapu: &quot;But I chose this inn because I heard it was 100 Gil
             for 3 nights.&quot;
 Mayor's Wife: &quot;Dear, let's just pay 300 Gil and stay at this inn.&quot;
 Fish Man: &quot;Well, um, it's coronation week, so the rate is 120 Gil
           per night...&quot;
 Mayor Kapu: &quot;Wh-Wh-What!? What kind of a business are you running
             here!?&quot;

                            is outside enjoying the sun. I'm
                            worried about Morrid, because he seems
                            so depressed once the cargo ship
                            coming. [The first sentence is not

 Morrid: &quot;I didn't know they were being used for war. I volunteered
         to look after the cargo shiponly because I like watching
         airships. I'm tired...&quot;
 Morrid: &quot;I want to drink some good coffee...&quot;

 [If you have all three rare coffee types by now:]

 Morrid: &quot;Oh! Oh my! Those are the legendary coffee beans I've been
         looking for! Would you mind giving me those beans?&quot;
         R1 --&gt; Sure
         R2 --&gt; No way

         R1: &quot;Oh, thank you! I can't imagine the trouble you
             must've went through to get them!&quot;

         R2: &quot;Ah, I understand. They are quite precious, indeed.
             But if you ever change your mind, come and visit me.&quot;

 [After R1, they go inside and Morrid gets his brew on.]

 Morrid: &quot;Oh... I'm so happy... I never imagined I'd get to drink
         all the rare coffees of the world... I've never felt so
         happy. I am ready to join my dearly departed wife now.
         I'll send you the model of the theater ship.&quot; [He repeats
         the last sentence when you talk to him again.]

 Dutiful Daughter Slai: &quot;Morrid seems very happy now!&quot;

 Mene: &quot;Can I see, kupo? ...This is super-spicy pepper, kupo. It
       was precious seasoning long, long ago. The Mist wiped out
       plant that grows these peppers, though... You should keep

             this way &lt;ribbit&gt;!&quot;

 [After he gets the key:]

 Regent Cid: &quot;I see a scale and some weights &lt;ribbit&gt;!&quot;
             R1 --&gt; Examine the scales
             R2 --&gt; Examine the weights
             R3 --&gt; Put weights on the scales
             R4 --&gt; Climb onto the scales

             R1: &quot;These are huge scales &lt;ribbit&gt;. I could probably
                 put 3 weights on a dish. I've got to climb onto
                 the scales in order to reach the hourglass
                 &lt;ribbit&gt;!&quot;

             R2: &quot;This weight is made of wood. This weight is made
                 of clay. This weight is made of stone. This weight
                 is made of iron.&quot;

             R3: &quot;Hmm... Which should I use &lt;ribbit&gt;?&quot;
                 R5 --&gt; Wood, clay, and stone
                 R6 --&gt; Wood, clay, and iron
                 R7 --&gt; Wood, stone, and iron
                 R8 --&gt; Clay, stone, and iron

             R4: &quot;I've gotta put something on the left side, too
                 &lt;ribbit&gt;!&quot;
             R5: [This one results in failure]
             R6: [This one results in failure]
             R7: [This one results in failure]
             R8: [This one results in success]

 [After putting weights on the scales:]

 Regent Cid: &quot;Now what &lt;ribbit&gt;?&quot;
             R8 --&gt; Remove weight
             R9 --&gt; Climb onto the scales

             R8: [The regent can remove weights.]
             R9: [If the Regent can't make it up:]

                 &quot;I'm still heavier than the other side.&quot; [The
                 process starts over.]

 [Zidane can inspect the lifts:]

 Zidane: &quot;Can I go upstairs with this? I guess not...&quot;

 [Zidane can find a hole behind one of the lifts.]

 Zidane: &quot;What is this hole?&quot; [If he inspects the bar next:] &quot;Hey!
         Maybe I can fit this in that hole! Let's see if this'll
         fit. Perfect!&quot; [The lift now goes up to the third floor.]

 Adventurer: &quot;Oh, I see... That should increase the water pressure
             to raise the remaining lifts. So what do you think of
             this place? Don't you find it strange that they are
             keeping all these books in a damp place like this?&quot;

 Engineer Zebolt: &quot;I came here to research a new source of power.
                  Some of the systems here are rather complicated.
                  The source of all this water is a mystery as
                  well. Maybe it really is the work of the dragon
                  god...&quot;

Scholar: &quot;I can't find 'The Eidolon and I.' I've looked everywhere.
Zidane: &quot;I saw that book over there.&quot;
Scholar: &quot;Oh, really? Thank you.&quot; [Can only cue this conversation
         [after you've inspected the &quot;?&quot; by the balcony.]

 Old Man: &quot;A good book lasts forever. It will always be there, in
          your memories. I've asked to be buried with my favorite
          book.&quot;

            here for 100 Gil?&quot; {Yes/No}

              [Item buy/sell screen opens up.]
 Sales Clerk: &quot;No no no. That's just what's on the--hold on. Can I
              help you?&quot; [Item buy/sell screen opens up.]

 Young Man: &quot;We're having a debate right now. In 'I Want to Be Your
            Canary,' why do you think Cornelia had to die?&quot;
 Sales Clerk: &quot;That was the only way she could be united with
              Marcus--in death.&quot;
 Young Man: &quot;No! It was to prove that she loved Marcus just as much
            as she loved her father. What do you think?&quot;
            R1 --&gt; She died to be united with Marcus
            R2 --&gt; She died to prove that she loved them both

            R1 (Sales Clerk): &quot;That's right! See!&quot;
            R2 (Young Man): &quot;Heh, heh, heh! I told you!&quot;

 Young Man: &quot;We're having a debate right now. Why do you think
            people spend so much time studying Gaia's moons?
 Sales Clerk: &quot;Because it's in our nature to pursue the truth. They
              wanna know more about the moons. That's all.&quot;
 Young Man: &quot;No! It's all about aesthetics. People are simply drawn
            by the beauty of the moons. That's why they're studying
            them. What do you think?&quot;
            R1 --&gt; They're studying to pursue the truth
            R2 --&gt; They're studying because of aesthetics

            R1 (Sales Clerk): &quot;That's right! See!&quot;
            R2 (Young Man): &quot;Heh, heh, heh! I told you!&quot;

 Young Man: &quot;We're having a debate right now about the importance
            of having nations.&quot;
 Sales Clerk: &quot;I'm telling you: We don't need nations in their
              world. They're just a politician's tool.&quot;
 Young Man: &quot;No! Nobody can live on his own. As social beings, we
            need to be organized under a single nation. What do you
            think?&quot;
            R1 --&gt; I don't think we need nations
            R2 --&gt; We need nations, though your reason sucks

            R1 (Sales Clerk): &quot;That's right! See!&quot;
            R2 (Young Man): &quot;Heh, heh, heh! I told you!&quot;

 [If you agree with the Sales Clerk the most:]

 Sales Clerk: &quot;Wow, looks like you and I are on the same page on

              it.&quot; [Receive: Meteor Card]

 [If you agree with the annoying Young Man the most:]

 Young Man: &quot;We seem to agree on a lot of stuff. Here, you can have
            this--as a token of our acquaintance.&quot; [Receive: Flare
            Card]

 [After getting one of the cards:]

 Young Man: &quot;We never agree on anything. I wonder why...&quot;

 [Zidane can inspect a &quot;?&quot; by a balcony:]

 Zidane: &quot;Geez. There are all kinds of books here. '...Bell Echoes'
         'Beyond the Mist' 'Mist Engine Illustrated' 'The Eidolon
         and I' 'Gaia' 'Book of Magic'&quot;

 [Zidane can find a stairway down after the scientist moves.]

 Zidane: &quot;This ladder feels kinda damp...&quot; {Go down/Forget it}

 [After the scientist moves:}

 Scholar: &quot;I enjoy my life here, being surrounded by all these

          want to read.&quot;

         R2 --&gt; I want to change party members
         R3 --&gt; I'll explain everything in order

         R1 (Crew Member): &quot;Our next destination is located south
                           of Ipsen's Castle. The hint is, 'My
                           power is protected underwater,
                           surrounded by the earth.'&quot;

         R2: [You can change your party. Afterwards, the Crewman
             will say: &quot;Godspeed!&quot;]

         R3: &quot;Alright, listen carefully... On top of this castle is
             a mural, a map of the world. There were 4 mirrors on
             the mural. The writing on the mirrors was in the
             language only I can read. 'My power is protected under
             the shaking ground.' 'My power is protected behind a
             tornado.' 'My power is protected high atop a fiery
             mountain.' 'My power is protected underwater,
             surrounded by the earth.' I'm sure the mirrors are
             pointing us to the locations that help us break the
             seal. What the monster said before he perished was a
             clue about the seal... 'One is all. All is one.'
             Meaning, there is a connection between these 4
             seals... ...That's everything. Do you understand now?&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Say what...? Okay, whatever... But hey, you have both

 Person: &quot;Heightened recognition of visual stimuli is a necessary

 Lani: &quot;You know, I saw some words that might mean something in the
       small room over there.&quot;

 [If Zidane inspects the tiny room nearby (w/ &quot;?&quot;):]

 Zidane: &quot;There's something carved on it...

 Narrative: Time moves forward once. Time moves backward once. Nine
            is the last number. It is also the first.

 Zidane: &quot;Movement of time...? If it's talking about a clock,
         forward is clockwise, and backward is counterclockwise.&quot;

                                                  __________________
 ________________________________________________/MS10 -- Eid. Wall |

 [There are numerous &quot;?&quot;s Zidane can inspect:]

 #1: We repeated the mistake our ancestors made 500 years ago. We
     failed an attempted summon at the foot of the Iifa Tree. The
     area surrounding the tree was unaffected, but we sealed the
     area as they would have done 500 years ago.

 #2: When the arrogant one summoned a power that could not be
     controlled, holy judgment was passed. The jewel of this
     village must serve as a reminder of the day we had to leave
     our country.

 [After doing the back-and-forth thing nine times, new pieces of
 inscriptions will show up on the wall:]

 #3: This information is yet to be confirmed, but there was an
     eyewitness account of a previously-undiscovered eidolon. It
     was witnessed in Esto Gaza. If there is an eidolon that can
     exist outside of our legends, our theory would no longer hold
     true. But maybe there are other tribes that have legends of
     their own.&quot;

 #4: Eiko, You are a treasure born to a dying village. We are
     dying, and there is little we can do for you. We shall return
     to the stars with one wish in mind. If legends are not born of
     eidolons, and eidolons but born out of legends, let us leave
     this place with one wish: If we can give birth to a legend, it
     shall create an eidolon that is friend and protector of
     humans.

 #5: Eiko, my lovely child. Until you turn 16 and have your own
     eidolon to your control, stay in this village. Then build
     strong friendships with others. I wish for your happiness from
     far away.

 #6: &quot;The First Eidolon Discovered, Shiva. Shiva took the form of a
     young girl when she was first discovered. She now appears as a
     grown woman. Eidolons adapt their forms to the time and
     culture in which they appear. Shiva illustrates this theory.
     In certain areas, Shiva is depicted as a snow fairy. This
     cannot be verified, since the only written document that
     remains is in the summoner village. People associate Shiva
     with the snow fairy. Why she changes forms remains a mystery.

 #7: The Legend of Eidolons: We discovered eidolons by researching
     legends documented from around the world. The Thunder God,
     Ramuh is one of those legends. Some theorize that the eidolons
     were created from the legends, and not the other way around.

 #8: This is where the fault lines collide. Listen to the planet's
     heartbeat. Breathe slowly, and calm your mind. Let memories
     return to you. Memories shape time. Time overlaps. The overlap
     becomes our memory. Memories construct time. History repeats
     itself. We must stand in its flow and understand the world.
     Such is the goal of our tribe.

 #9: Fear not the power of summon magic, but the ones who use it.
     Greed and instability endlessly repeat old mistakes. Will
     omniscience set us free?

 [If Garnet's with, you can witness the tenth one, too:]

 #10: I survived the storm. I wonder if you two are okay? I see the
      two of you smile every time I close my eyes. I imagine I see
      you when I open my eyes. I have a mortal wound. I won't be
      able to wait for you very long. I regret being so unemotional
      all these years. I'm writing down everything here in the hope
      that you'll read it someday. To my dearest wife, Jane,
      Although we fought many times, and I may not have shown my
      affection enough, I love you very much. To my beloved
      daughter, Sarah, My life changed when you were born. You made
      me happy. These are the things I want you to know.

 Old Man: &quot;You appear to be quite the traveler. I can tell... If

          can you please bring it to me? Consider it a dying man's
          last wish. I will give you something in return.&quot;

 Librarian: &quot;Grandpa Kukuro is really getting forgetful these

            and chairs, we also have hammocks for people who fall
            asleep while they are reading. Would you like to stay
            here for 100 Gil?&quot; {Y/N}

          R1: &quot;Oh, thank you!!! ......&quot;

              Zidane: &quot;What's wrong?&quot;

              Old Man: &quot;...I used to be a fairly well-known
                       blacksmith. My work was everything to me,
                       and then one day, my wife died... That's
                       when I moved here. I've lived here ever
                       since. Few years ago, I read a biography of
                       a great craftsman named Gogo who was known
                       for making dolls that looked like real
                       people. Supposedly, the secret to his
                       extraordinary skill was in his fingers. So,
                       I figured if I could get his fingers and
                       combine them with my skills, I could make a
                       doll that looked like my wife. ...I'm such a
                       fool. Look at these fingers. They look worn-
                       -down, as if they never got a break. They
                       look just like my fingers... I thank you
                       from the bottom of my heart. I now realize
                       that I accept who I am and how I have lived
                       my life. Please accept this as a token of my
                       gratitude. I no longer need it. [+Excalibur]

          R2: &quot;Okay. I understand...&quot;

                        get back because the cable card had stopped!
                        So, I ended up staying with her longer than
                        I had expected. Now I can't imagine living
                        without her. I'm so glad the Mist cleared.

         item? We need it to repair Mognet!

 Mois: &quot;They gotta tell me more than 'that item'! Kupo!!!&quot;

 [Talk to Mois again about Mognet, and:]

 Mois: &quot;Hey, you gotta deliver a letter to Noggy for me! Kupo!&quot;
       R1 --&gt; Yes
       R2 --&gt; No

       R1: &quot;Thanks, kupo!&quot; [He gives you the letter.]
       R2: &quot;I'm so sad, kupo...&quot; [He doesn't give you the letter.]

         From Mois to Noggy

         I think Mognet can go back to standard operation if we get
         the right item! Kupo! If you ask me, I think the item
         they're looking for is that thing! You know what I mean,
         right? It's that...thing!

 Noggy: &quot;That thing... Oh, I know! Kupo! Kupo!&quot;

 [Talk to Mois again about Mognet, and:]

         From Noggy to Kupo

         I now know what's needed to run the machine in Mognet
         Central! It's 'Superslick'! I heard a rumor about it! The
         rumor said that someone in Alexandria has it! That's what
         I heard! Kupo! Find it and send it to Central right away!

 Kupo: &quot;Ah, 'Superslick'! Kupo! But I don't know who has any...&quot;

 [If you talk to Ruby after delivering the letter:]

 Ruby: &quot;Well, fry my hide! How'd you know I use this here
       Superslick in my hair? You want to try some? How come you be
       a-needin' it? You wanna be beautiful like me? Yer pullin' my

 Quina: &quot;Something smell...&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;What's wrong, Quina? You just came out of nowhere...&quot;

 Quina: &quot;You no smell? Something smell wonderful...&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;No, my nose doesn't work like yours does...&quot;

 Quina: &quot;A-Aiyaaah!&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Wh-What happened!?&quot;

 Quina: &quot;I-Is amazing, Zidane! Is miracle!&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;?&quot;

 Quina: &quot;It a feast!!!&quot; [Quina imagines a gigantic feast around.]
        &quot;I-Is unbelievable... I not know where to start! What I eat
        first? Hohoho! &lt;Ng-ng-ng...&gt; I-Is sooo good! Hohoho!
        &lt;Ng-ng-ng...&gt; Is delicious!!! Delicious...&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Hey, Quina...&quot;

 Quina: &quot;I no eat anymore...&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Oh, man...&quot;

 Quina: &quot;!? Oh, what happen!? Feast is gone...&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;What are you talking about, Quina? I think you were
         hallucinating.&quot;

 Quina: &quot;I-Is not true! I saw with own eyes!

 Zidane: &quot;But you were just running around...&quot;

 Quina: &quot;Hmm!? I smell something this way!&quot; [S/he heads to balcony]

 Zidane: &quot;Hey, Quina! Geez...&quot;

 Voice: &quot;Quina! You stop!&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;?&quot;

 [Quina goes out onto the balcony and finds Quan (!?):]

 Quan: &quot;I finally here...&quot;

 Quina: &quot;Wh-Who you!? You the one who show me illusion!?&quot;

 Quan: &quot;I Quan... Is illusion only if you see illusion... You saw
       because you travel around world.&quot;

 Quina: &quot;Wh-What you mean!?&quot;

 [Quale runs in.]

 Quale: &quot;Is cheap trick!&quot;

 Quina: &quot;Master!? What you talk about!?&quot;

 Quale: &quot;He my former master! He run away and escape training!&quot;

 Quan: &quot;I no run from training... It you who make mistake.&quot;

 Quale: &quot;What!?&quot;

 Quan: &quot;To eat everything not true way of gourmand! Your student
       already start to realize! Quina, what you saw you used
       imagination... Is your imagination you used to eat.&quot;

 Quina: &quot;I-I not know... But it taste like real food!&quot;

 Quan: &quot;Is all good... You travel around the world and gain
       imagination. People who no have imagination no taste until
       they actually eat!&quot;

 Quale: &quot;Mmm!?&quot;

 Quan: &quot;You use imagination, is possible to taste all food in world!
       It no matter if it story somebody else tell. Is possible to
       eat with your imagination!&quot;

 Quale: &quot;......&quot;

 Quina: &quot;H-How did Master's master learn to do this...?&quot;

 Quan: &quot;Is because...&quot;

 [Vivi runs in.]

 Vivi: &quot;Grandpa!&quot;

 Quan: &quot;Ah, Vivi! You...no grow much at all. Is thanks to Vivi I
       learn about imagination... I teach Vivi, who not know
       anything about world outside. My imagination grow very big
       as I teach him!&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;Grandpa...&quot;

 Quan: &quot;To eat same as to live... Vivi, you understand? To see not
       only thing. To think and talk just as important. Life end
       when you die. But imagination share with others, live
       forever. My spirit almost gone. Is where my imagination
       end...&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;No... Are you going away again, Grandpa?&quot;

 Quan: &quot;No need be sad... Vivi, as long as you imagine, I by your
       side. Quina and Quale... Good luck...&quot;

 [Quan's being fades away.]

 Quale: &quot;M-MASTER!&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Hey, who are you guys all talking to...?&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;What?&quot;

 Quale: &quot;Quina... I start over from beginning...&quot;

 [Quale leaves.]

 Quina: &quot;Master...&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Who were you talking to...?&quot;

 Quina: &quot;You no see, Zidane?&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;See what? I saw you guys talking into space.&quot;

 Quina: &quot;I see... You still have long way to go, Zidane.&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;Never mind, Zidane. I'll tell you about it some other time.

 Zidane: &quot;?&quot;

 Vivi: &quot;Let's get going! There are still so many things to
       understand!&quot;

 Zidane: &quot;Y-Yeah...&quot;

 Mene: &quot;Do you have all Chocograph Pieces!? They make up one
       Chogograph now, kupo! Take a look at what it says on the
       back. Go treasure hunting, kupo! Choco said he already dug
       up all the Chocographs here. Kupo... Maybe you can go to
       some other locations by using Dead Pepper.&quot;

 [If you go back to the forest or lagoon once you've a gold choco:]

 Mene: &quot;Your color changed again! Congratulations, kupo! I have
       good news, too, kupo! I figured out some things about Dead
       Pepper, kupo! You may already know, but if you give Choco
       Dead Pepper, it boosts his ability for a limited time.
       Legends say we can get to paradise using that ability! The
       paradise is not on the map, but I know you can find it, kupo!
       Good luck!&quot;

 Mene: &quot;Kupo! I followed you because I thought you'd find this

 Mene: &quot;I'm speechless, kupo...&quot;

 Gold Choco: &quot;Kweh.&quot;

 Gold Choco: &quot;Kweh.&quot;

 [NPC Dialogue after you talk to Fat Chocobo for first time:]

 Gold Choco: &quot;Kweh, kwokkwehkweh, kweh.&quot; (The western side of the
             mountain on Seaways Canyon on the Forgotten Continent
             also has a crack in it.) &quot;Kwok, kwek, kweh.&quot; (But it's
             very hard to find.)

 Gold Choco: &quot;K-Kwekweh, Kweh?&quot; (Did you know that you can use a
             Dead Pepper to crumble cracked mountain walls?)

 _______________________________________/CP02 -- Fat Chocobo Pltfrm |

 [When you first get up there:]

 Fat Chocobo: &quot;Seeker Choco, welcome... I am Fat Chocobo, the king
              of Chocobo's Paradise! It would have been better if
              you'd come here without the help of humans...but they
              have taken good care of you. I've made it so they can
              understand our language while they're here...&quot;

 Choco: &quot;Kweh.&quot;

 Fat Chocobo: &quot;You, who brought Choco here... Choco will stay here
              and start a new life with us. You should say your
              goodbyes now.&quot;

 Choco: &quot;K-Kweh?&quot;

 Mene: &quot;I'm Mene! I'll live here, too, kupo!&quot;

 Fat Chocobo: &quot;...Little one.&quot;

 Mene: &quot;Kupo?&quot;

 Fat Chocobo: &quot;Only chocobos can live here.&quot;

 Mene: &quot;...No exceptions?&quot;

 Fat Chocobo: &quot;No exceptions...&quot;

 Mene: &quot;...Choco...&quot;

 Fat Chocobo: &quot;Have you finished your goodbyes?&quot;

 Mene: &quot;Not yet, kupo! Choco still needs to find more treasures!&quot;

 Fat Chocobo: &quot;Choco, were you not looking for peace and
              companionship? Are there things you must take care
              of?&quot;

 Choco: &quot;...Kweh.&quot;

 Fat Chocobo: &quot;Then come back when you finish what you must do.&quot;

 Mene: &quot;...I'm goin' home, kupo. I'll be waiting at the usual
       location, kupo!&quot;

 [NPC Dialogue up on that platform:]

 Gold Choco: &quot;Kweh, kwek, kwohkweh, kweh.&quot; (You can see where the
             floating island is by checking the location of the
             shadow on the 6 Chocograph Pieces.)

 Gold Choco: &quot;Kwo, kwek, kweh, kweh...&quot; (This paradise existed long
             before the disaster 5,000 years ago...) &quot;Kwekkwek,
             kweh, kwoh...&quot; (The Dead Pepper has been our favorite
             food for 5,000 years...)

 Fat Chocobo: &quot;I'll give you a hint... There are still so many
              treasures out there. You need a special ability to
              find them. You already know that Dead Pepper gives
              Choco a special ability, because you are here... His
              beak can crack open stone walls, he can jump into the
              ocean and fly high in the sky... Use these abilities
              and seek out the treasures. I'll wait here for your
              return...&quot;

 Reef Choco: &quot;Kwok, kwekweh, kkweh.&quot; (There's a crack on the
             mountain located on a long island north of Outer
             Continent. I heard something say 'kupo' from the
             crack.)

 Blue Choco: &quot;K-Kweh, kwek, kwek.&quot; (The east side of the mountain
             on Seaways Canyon on the Forgotten Continent has a
