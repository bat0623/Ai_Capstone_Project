That said, training Quina into having a full arsenal rewards the player with one of the best Blue Mages in the series, as Quina now can function as a better healer than Garnet or Eiko, a damage dealer only rivaled by Zidane and Freya, the ability to hit elemental weaknesses with better efficiency than Vivi, and a combination buffer and debuffer that outshines Amarant.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower

Plus, the fact that his Flair abilities don't technically count as magic make him an ideal character to take to the magic-blocking Oeilvert.

-   He's also this to Vivi. Both are artificial beings who were made to invade other places and they both face the revelation that they're going to be dying much sooner than they anticipated.

This may be a case of [Gameplay and Story Integration](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration), as Kuja's stats when fought as a boss a full disc later give him a boatload of HP (42,382 to be precise), far more than Bahamut could deplete.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron

Despite Garland beating him to the punch on destroying Alexandria, Kuja still effectively vanquishes the four major kingdoms of the Mist Continent with very little effort. Even during Disc 3, he still manipulates the party into doing most of his dirty work for him.

He puts on exaggerated efforts to seem sophisticated and intelligent to assert his individuality, is very narcissistic and selfish, and is prone to quickly losing his temper when he doesn't get his way. According to creation materials, this is why Garland created Zidane as a baby â€” he would be able to grow and mature in order to develop the complex emotions needed to enter [Trance](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode), while Kuja was created as an adult and never matured emotionally beyond the young mindsets of regular Genomes.

He even manages to damage the Original Crystal, as per his original intent. The only reason he fails to destroy everything is because he had no idea that Necron existed and needed to destroy reality himself in order for Crystal to truly be undone.

The only reason why Kuja wasn't put down the moment he showed signs of instability was because Garland believed that he might be useful â€” at least until a stronger Genome was available to replace him, whereupon he'd simply be disposed of. Thus, gaining power strong enough to overpower that hypothetical genome and eventually overthrow Garland was the only way for Kuja to ensure his survival.

In fact, the only reason why Kuja's activities on Gaia were permitted were because most of them benefited Garland in some way - until the battle of Alexandria. Similarly, once Zidane makes it clear that he can't be convinced to become his Angel of Death, Garland rips his soul out, intending to reduce him to another Genome vessel.

He created Kuja, who, at Garland's behest, encouraged Brahne to pursue her desire for conquest.

However, where Kuja is a [Large Ham](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam) who likes to behave as flamboyantly as possible, Garland is calm, composed, and rarely acts with any kind of drama; where Kuja is actively cruel and sadistic, Garland is simply pragmatic to the point of ignoring the suffering of others; where Kuja is relentlessly selfish, Garland acts only for the sleeping Terrans and has seemingly no desires of his own; where Kuja refuses to admit defeat even when he has nothing to gain except total destruction, Garland willingly aids Zidane in order to prevent the destruction of the universe.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil

Also, after Kuja murders him and destroys Terra, Garland returns to assist Zidane on his journey through Memoria, even though Zidane's interference made said destruction possible.

For example, when the summoners of Madain Sari grew too powerful for him to tolerate, Garland carpet-bombed their village into dust; when Kuja tried to take control of the eidolon Alexander, Garland simply assumed control of the *Invincible* and destroyed Alexander with two shots, forcing Kuja into a humiliating defeat; finally, the moment he learned that Zidane would never willingly serve him, Garland just ripped his soul out.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNonsenseNemesis

-   Fittingly, given how much inspiration *Final Fantasy* takes from *[NausicaÃ¤ of the Valley of the Wind](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind)*, his scheme and motives are reminiscent of the manga's main antagonist,  (SPOILER) the Crypt of Shuwa, a biological program designed by the old humans to purify the Earth from its polluted state. Ultimately, its goal was to cleanse the world, including all the new humans that adapted to it, so that old humanity could be reborn from stasis. Much like NausicaÃ¤'s Earth, Terra was a dying world that sought to assimilate Gaia so that its population could be reborn there.
