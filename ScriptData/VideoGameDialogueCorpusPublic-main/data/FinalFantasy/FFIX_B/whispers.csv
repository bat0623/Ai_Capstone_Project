Mogster,"First, I'll go over the battle controls. - Basic Battle Controls 1 - (><) Confirm. (O) Cancel. (/) Cycle to the next ready character when the ATB Gauge is full. (()) Hold down to clear menu. - Basic Battle Controls 2 - (L1)(R1) Select single/multiple targets. (L2) Turn the target window on/off. (START) Pause. (SELECT) Turn on/off help. Next, I'll talk about ATB. ATB stands for Active Time Battle. Time during battle is managed by the ATB System. There are 2 ATB modes: Active and Wait. You can select them in the Config Menu. - ATB Mode - Active Always real-time (time never stops during battle). Wait Time stops when you are selecting magic and items. If you're a beginner, I think you should choose Wait. Active is for more advanced players. Now, let's go over damage points. Numbers and details pop up during battle whenever your HP and MP change. Numbers appear in 2 different colors. - Damage Points - 9999 HP change; White numbers indicate damage. Green numbers indicate HP recovery. 9999MP MP change; White numbers indicate loss. Green numbers indicate MP recovery. - Damage Details - Miss When the attack misses. Critical When you deal greater damage than usual. Death When you get KO'd. Guard When status attacks and elemental attacks have no effect. Finally, I'll give you some tips regarding Order. The Order option involves not only the lineup but also the battle position. There are 2 battle positions: front row and back row. - Front Row and Back Row - Front Row You can deal big damage with Attack, but you can also receive big damage. Back Row You can only deal small damage with Attack, but you receive less damage from attacks. You can change this setting with the Order option. You can also switch between the front and back row during battle, by selecting Change. If you use magic or long-range weapons, you can deal just as much damage from the back row as you can from the front row. In tough battles, adjusting battle positions appropriately might save your life. Okay, I think I've covered enough battle stuff.",(time never stops during battle),
