My dad and I never talked so much. Whoa ... Didn't mean to reminisce, folks. Anyway ... Ten years later, the Jecht Memorial Cup tournament is today! The two teams that have won through to the finals are ... of course, the Abes from A-East, and the Duggles from C-South. I know there's a lot of people out there today to see the star of the Abes! In just one year, he's become the team's number one player! He's Jecht's blood, and the new hope of blitzball! What kind of super play will he show us today? Will we see his father's legendary shot?

I couldn't sleep, so I wandered into the town, away from the celebrating crowds. I stood on the bridge in Bevelle where my father and I had parted. Standing there, alone, I could see the fields where he had fought Sin. Then, you appeared, Kimahri. You said you were looking for the daughter of Braska, remember? At first, I was so scared.

You just held me, without saying a word. I cried after we got to Besaid, too. When you tried to go after leaving me in the care of the temple ... I held onto you, crying, \"Don't go, don't go!\" And you listened, Kimahri. You stayed. Kimahri, thank you. Thank you so much. And I've always liked your broken horn."

Wonderful ... but it hurts, sometimes. I wonder. I ... I just want to say, thank you for everything. Maybe ... maybe that's why it hurts. When I ...

But ... the fiends all got away because I, uh, screwed up. I'm too old to gather fiends now, so I'm in quite a fix ... So, that's where you come in, sonny! Can I ask you to round up all the fiends for me? Of course, I'm not asking you to do it for free. There'll be nice, fat rewards! On top of that, you can hone your fighting skills anytime against the fiends you bring back here! In addition, any items you win during training are yours to keep for free! But, there will be a small fee for each training session, so bear that in mind. How about it? Not a bad deal, eh? You won't regret it!"

Oh, by the way ... Jecht and Auron send their regards. So far, our journey has been very entertaining. Of course, it is a hard journey, but I have no regrets. It is the path I have chosen. Yuna, when you have grown, you will have to find your own path. Do what you must do, the way you want to do it. Doors will always open themselves to those who do. Listen close, Yuna. Your future is yours to make. Live the way you want to. Whatever way that may be, you have your father's full support. Yuna, I will always be with you."

I am truly glad that I had that chance. Having you as a guardian was so great an honor I don't know how to thank you. Perhaps if I defeat Sin, that will be my thanks to you. That's what I'll do. Yes. I will challenge Sin. I will defeat Sin. If you are all there watching this, then I guess Sin is already gone. And so am I, I suppose. Anyway, I just wanted to say Sir Auron, I thank you."

I was so happy. But when night came, it occurred to me. My father had defeated Sin and now he was dead. Now, I was all alone. I couldn't sleep, so I wandered into the town, away from the celebrating crowds. I stood on the bridge in Bevelle where my father and I had parted. Standing there, alone, I could see the fields where he had fought Sin. Then, you appeared, Kimahri. You said you were looking for the daughter of Braska, remember? At first, I was so scared. Until I realized what a gentle person you are."

That it was the wish of a man facing death. I think ... I cried then. Because that ... that was when I knew my father was dead ... and I would never see him again. You just held me, without saying a word. I cried after we got to Besaid, too. When you tried to go after leaving me in the care of the temple ... I held onto you, crying, \"Don't go, don't go!\" And you listened, Kimahri. You stayed. Kimahri, thank you. Thank you so much. And I've always liked your broken horn."

And when you refused to let me become a summoner and I did it anyway ... I'm sorry. I've always wanted to apologize. You know, when you tried to stop me then\u2013really, I was happy. I could tell you really cared about me. You were like my big brother and sister. No ... I think you really were my big brother and sister. What else ... I love watching you play blitzball, Wakka."

We haven't even known each other that long, but ... It's funny. So ... So this is what it feels like. It's a much more wonderful feeling than anything I had ever imagined. Wonderful ... but it hurts, sometimes. I wonder. I ... I just want to say, thank you for everything. Maybe ... maybe that's why it hurts. When I ... When I think about us never being together again at all ... I'm afraid. No, I shouldn't say that. I'll do that part over. Um ..."
