He wanted to make Tidus a star blitzball player like him, but his attempts to do so involved berating his son and acting like he would never amount to anything. Part of Jecht's development in Spira is realizing he messed up, and owns up to his mistakes in the end, realizing his son has every reason to hate him.

Jecht was a buff sports superstar, he lived a life full of machismo and fame, and he drank heavily. Because of all of this, Jecht has absolutely no way to resonate or bond with a child who doesn't share in the machismo, and his attempts to make Tidus like him backfire since instead he just becomes a bully towards his son. While he does love Tidus, he has trouble talking to him without coming off as a condescending jerk, which made Tidus both hate and fear him. It takes him journeying through Spira, giving up drinking, and learning he never will be able to return home to fully admit his failures, and even then he cannot do anything to fix it until Tidus is almost an adult.

../data/FinalFantasy/FFX_B/,Final Fantasy X,Jecht,Jecht,Puzzle Boss,0," [Puzzle Boss](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss): In the fight with Braska's Final Aeon, he has two pillars behind him that will each heal him for 1500 health every turn, for a total of 3000 health if both are active. If you are underleveled, they can easily undo the damage dealt to him. AND their healing ability also increases Jecht's overdrive gauge. Fortunately the two pillars can be attacked, and if they lose all their health, they are knocked out for a few turns, allowing for uninterrupted damage on Jecht. The rub is that all extra damage they take when being knocked out gets permanently added to their total health when they revive. So if they have 5000 health total, and you were to knock one out with an attack that does 5500 damage, when they get back up, they'll have 500 extra health (and if you were to knock them out with 15000 damage, they'd revive with 15000 health). This means that you have to be careful with how much you damage them (and be careful with Aeon overdrives), because if they gain too much health, knocking them out becomes less and less feasible, turning the fight into a long battle of attrition.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss

-   Also, in the original Japanese, the homonyms detailed above are *not* a coincidence; in particular, the ""deity"" meaning is descriptive, as a malevolent deity that goes around punishing people for their transgressions (and killing them - ""shin"" again) is what the creature is meant to come across as.

This makes him very versatile and able to be molded to whatever role you need easily. The trade-off is that he's also a [Master of None](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone), since he will inevitably trail behind anyone whose grid he enters, while Rikku joins at such a low sphere level that she'll pass him even if Kimahri is ahead of her at first.

However, if you can get your [Relationship Values](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues) with her high enough, she reveals the reasons she acts this way and also shows she can be rather insightful.
-   The death of her mother taught her that you can't waste your life being sad, and that you need to live it up while you can, especially in a [Crapsack World](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld) like Spira.
-   In Guadosalam, she reflects she's already looking to get married once she meets the right guy. Tidus lampshades she's a bit young to be thinking that way, but Rikku explains in a world where fiends or Sin could kill you at any moment, why wait until she's ""older"" to think about it? She also wants to have a lot of kids so they'll have a big family to take care of each other if anything happens to her or the father.

It's really more like she's an [Agent Scully](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentScully), who has *a* spiritual belief; just not the ""main"" one, as it were.

-   *X-2* includes an optional hotsprings scene where she blatantly checks out Yuna's body and remarks: ""I know who's got it goin' on."" A later scene has Rikku compare herself and Yuna to Lenne and her dead lover, Shuyin, respectively, because both she and Shuyin tried to save the ones they loved.

She isn't a great fighter and it'll be a while before she can learn any good magic, so her main contribution will probably be in using items.

-   To reflect on the above paragraph, his voice is deeper in the opening montage than in his earliest canonical appearances. James Arnold Taylor did this intentionally to indicate the character's newfound maturity. However, it's also a result of his voice actor being given poor direction: James Arnold Taylor believed Tidus was narrating events from well into the future, and gave him an older voice for those parts. It doesn't match up with the the youthful voice Tidus uses even after the game catches up with his narration.
-   At the start of the game. Tidus views his father as nothing more than an [abusive, drunk, asshole,](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents) [who left him and his mom at a young age](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad) and still casts a shadow over him as a Blitzball star.

Their context, backstories, and roles differ greatly.<ul>
-   Zidane is an [Experienced Protagonist](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencedProtagonist), he's been on a few adventures before and has earned his fair share of friends, and enemies throughout Gaia before the story has even begun. Tidus is a [Fish out of Water](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater) who knows absolutely nothing about Spira's culture, people and geography and has to learn at the same pace the player does.
-   Zidane is quite a flirt and seems to constantly have girl's on his mind even when he begins to develop feelings towards Garnet. Ironically, [he has issues with telling Garnet his true feelings towards her despite his many flirtatious comments.](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut) Meanwhile, Tidus doesn't seem all too interested in flirting with other girls. The closest he gets is telling two female fans that he'll be thinking of them as he plays. The most he ever views Lulu and Rikku are older and younger sister-figures, respectively. However, he is very aware about his feelings towards Yuna and [he makes it very clear to her how he much he loves her.](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigDamnKiss)
-   Both eventually learn the truths about who they are late in the story, but their purposes couldn't be any more different. Zidane learns the [Awful Truth](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth) that [he's a Genome created for the sole purpose of destroying all life on Gaia,](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingWeapon) the world he's grown to love. This revelation [shocks him to the core to the point he begins refuting the idea that he deserves to have friends.](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD) Meanwhile Tidus learns that he is nothing but a dream of the Fayth and once that dream is over, he will cease to be. Other than that, [Tidus has no real importance in the grand scheme of things other than being a Blitzball star from Zanarkand.](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnchosenOne) This is important, as Tidus doesn't seem to care all too much about it and this lack of importance is what allows him to speak his mind on the state of the [Crapsack World](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld) that is Spira and influence his companions, most importantly of all, Yuna, into striving to make their world a better place rather than dying to false hope.
-   Gameplay-wise, while both are very agile and evasive in combat, their roles are quite different. Zidane is a classic thief who's all about stealing, [dual wields](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding) daggers, and uses his non-traditional ""thief-swords"" in combat. Tidus is more of a traditional warrior, he uses longswords and employs time magic to control the pacing of a fight.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrastingSequelMainCharacter

-   He's also an unlockable character in the Fiend Arena.
-   And he can be glimpsed in a flashback to his notorious ""laughing"" scene (and the more poignant ""whistling"" scene) in Luca.
-   When Yuna falls into the Farplane at the end of Chapter 3, she (by prompt from the player) will start whistling, which causes an image of Tidus to appear and guide her back to Spira.

However, he's somewhat lacking in the health and defense departments, meaning that, when fighting most major bosses (who are often just as fast as Tidus and immune to his slowing attacks), you're better off using someone hardier, as Tidus will just end up dying a lot. That being said, if the player dips into Auron's side of the Sphere Grid a little, Tidus will quickly become a [Lightning Bruiser](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser) who hits as hard as Auron, but is faster, and much more durable as a result.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster

-   Tidus brags about being the superstar player of the Zanarkand Abes. He can more than live up to it if you play blitzball, particularly if you exploit the Jecht Shot.

Tidus is also the only party member to notice that Auron is an unsent, long before Auron reveals this secret to him.

-   The ""Tidus"" recording turns out to be Shuyin, the main antagonist of *X-2*. It's a little unclear whether Tidus was based on Shuyin or not, but they share the same backstory and voice actors. The difference is that Shuyin fought and died in the Machina War, never got sent, became unstable, and turned evil (it's also implied that Shuyin is older, which gives a possibility that Tidus may become like Shuyin. *X-2.5* lightly shows how Tidus becomes a bit unstable after his lovers' quarrel with Yuna).</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger
