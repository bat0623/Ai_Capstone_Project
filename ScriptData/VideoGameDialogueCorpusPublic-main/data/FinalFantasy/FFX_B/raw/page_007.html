<span class="Y">Yuna: Business with me? Whatever could it be, I wonder?</span><br />
<span class="M">Tromell: Please, come inside the manor. All will be explained. Of course, your friends are also welcome.</span><br />

<p><span class="npc"><a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/guadogroupie.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/guadogroupie.jpg" target="screencap">Guado woman in purple</a>: Thank you so much for destroying that Al Bhed contraption. Those heathens are despicable. I feel so relieved now.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;If you see any more of those Al Bhed, you go right ahead and beat them up.</p>
<p><a href="../characters/noy.jpg" target="screencap">Guado blitzer</a> (Noy): We Guado help the warrior monks patrol the roads beyond. Why wouldn&#8217;t we do all we can for the good of Spira?<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Someday when the Crusaders regroup, we&#8217;ll want them to help us, too.</p>
<p><a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/guadoOP.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/guadoOP.jpg" target="screencap">Innkeeper</a>: The Guado welcome all guests. Would you like to rest here?</span>

<span class="M"><a href="../characters/shelinda.jpg" target="screencap">Shelinda</a>: Oh, how fare you, Sir Guardian? It seems that Maester Seymour has returned to Guadosalam. He&#8217;s young, but he deserves our respect.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;The maester is also the high priest of Macalania temple. So he administers both the temple and Guado affairs.<br />
I hope to get an audience with Maester Seymour, myself.</span><br />
<span class="bs"><br />

<li class="choice">No, thanks.</li>
<li class="reply"><span class="M">Maechen: Pity. Suit yourself.</span></li>
<li class="choice">Tell me about the Farplane.</li>
<li class="reply"><span class="M">Maechen: Ahem! The Farplane&#8217;s the place where pyreflies born from a sending gather. They appear in the shape of people who&#8217;ve died and gone to the Farplane. Quite the phenomenon; how I wish I understood it more fully! The Al Bhed have a theory, you know. They say the pyreflies are just reacting to visitors&#8217; thoughts and dreams. But only the dead appear on the Farplane. No image of the living has ever been seen. It&#8217;s a great mystery! But maybe&#8230;Maybe the dead leave a bit of themselves in the hearts of the living. And that little bit borrows the pyreflies&#8217; power for their paranormal performance! Or maybe not. Who knows? And that, as they say, is that.</span></li>
<li class="choice">Tell me about the pyreflies.</li>
<li class="reply"><span class="M">Maechen: Ahem! They may be called &#8220;pyreflies&#8221; but they aren&#8217;t really &#8220;flies,&#8221; you see. They&#8217;re those lights you see whenever a fiend dies. The little fellows are responsible for a few fantastic phenomena. Visions of the past, spheres, fiends&#8211; these are all the pyreflies&#8217; doing. In fact&#8230; pyreflies have something to do with aeons, too. The dreams of the fayth reach through the spirit of the summoner&#8230; And that which is unreal becomes real for all to see! Or maybe not. Who knows? And that, as they say, is that.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="M">&nbsp;&#172;Can&#8217;t get enough? Like to hear it one more time? <span class="choices">[No, thanks. | What about this Farplane? | Let&#8217;s hear about these pyreflies.]</span></span><br />
</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Guado Glories House</h4>
<p><span class="npc"><a href="../characters/pah.jpg" target="screencap">Pah Guado</a> (in corner): Say, you play for the Besaid Aurochs. You&#8217;re Tidus, right? I saw you at the tournament. Let&#8217;s blitz sometime.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Those fiends really made a mess. Some of my teammates were badly hurt.</p>
<p><a href="../characters/zazi.jpg" target="screencap">Zazi Guado</a> (on chair): I&#8217;d love to step away from the Guado glories and play for a different team once in a while. Why, if they paid me enough, I&#8217;d even play for the Al Bhed!</p>
<p><a href="../characters/guadoBY.jpg" target="screencap">Snooty Guado in yellow</a>: As sole protectors of the Farplane, the Guado are the supreme race of Spira. We are fundamentally different from the populous humans and the hulking Ronso. But, that&#8217;s an old story. Now the Guado seek harmony with other races.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Let us welcome humans and Ronso without prejudice.</p>
<p><a href="../characters/guadogirl.jpg" target="screencap">Guado girl in purple</a>: You find it difficult telling us Guado apart, don&#8217;t you? I suppose you think we all look the same.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Actually, we Guado tend to have trouble telling one human from another, too.</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">House of the Fusty Elders</h4>
<p><span class="npc"><a href="../characters/guadoyouth.jpg" target="screencap">Young Guado in blue</a>: Lord Seymour instructs the Guado youth on numerous subjects. Thanks to him, I learned about Yevon&#8217;s teachings and the history of Spira.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Lord Seymour is a great teacher. He explains everything quite clearly.</p>
<p><a href="../characters/guadoold.jpg" target="screencap">Old fart in green</a>: Thou seem&#8217;st weary, good traveller. Wouldst sit and rest thy feet awhile? Ah, belike my speech perplexes thee? &#8216;Tis old Guado I speak, a tongue seldom heard within even Guadosalam now.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;A dying breed we are, speakers of the old tongue. I fear this precious legacy hath but little time remaining.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Many Guado shun the old tongue, favouring instead the speech of foreign tribes. &#8216;Tis a pity, verily.</p>
<p>Old fartess in yellow: Good traveller, prithee forgive us our antiquated prattling.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Once, all Guado spoke the old tongue. But when Lord Jyscal brought us to the light of Yevon&#8230; the old tongue fell out of favour with many, and suffers now a slow demise.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;The youth laugh upon us as stale old relics who live too much in the past.</p>
<p><a href="../characters/yuma.jpg" target="screencap">Yuma Guado</a> (Blitzer in back): The elders just won&#8217;t give up the old tongue. I keep telling them how unseemly it is, babbling like that to guests.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;It&#8217;s just what old folks do, I guess. Please, take no offense.</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Guadosalam Shop</h4>
<p><span class="npc"><a href="../characters/guadoOP.jpg" target="screencap">Shopkeeper</a>: Ah, one of Lady Yuna&#8217;s guardians. How may I help you today? <span class="choices">[Buy weapons. | Buy items. | Leave.]</span><br />
&nbsp;&#172;Please return anytime.</p>
<p><a href="../characters/guadohood.jpg" target="screencap">Guado woman in hood</a>: My husband has long served as a guardian to the leaders of the Guado. These days he accompanies Lord Seymour all over Spira.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;We imagine Lord Seymour will rise to great glory in Spira.</span></p>

Then Lord Gandof appeared &#8212; a man later to become high summoner. He scoured the continent for the Qactuars and drove them to these plains. Once he&#8217;d gathered the Qactuars together, Lord Gandof linked the sign of (&#9633;), whereupon the Qactuars turned to smoke and were absorbed by a stone. The Qactuars were thus sealed into stone, fated to face lightning day and night. Unless someone again links the (&#9633;) sign and releases the seal, they shall suffer within the stone for their deeds. Thus did Lord Gandof bring relief to peoples all over Spira. He believed that the battle with Sin was only one great part of a summoner&#8217;s greater mission.</span></li>

<span class="G">Auron: No, I&#8217;m not. As long as she is willing to face Sin&#8230;all else is her concern. That is a summoner&#8217;s privilege. As long as she journeys.</span><br />

She&#8217;s &#8220;privileged.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t understand. But somehow, I felt like I didn&#8217;t belong. But if I didn&#8217;t belong with them, I&#8217;d be stuck in Spira, alone. And being alone in that place, well, I didn&#8217;t want to think about it.</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: Next, we&#8217;re going to <font color="#0000aa">Macalania Temple</font>. Yuna can talk with Seymour there. We guardians will wait until they&#8217;re done, and plan our next move. Understood?</span></p>
