<span class="G">Auron: He is dead. As dead as Jyscal was. His attachment to this world kept him from the next.</span><br />
<span class="R">Rikku: Whoa, scary!</span></p>
<p><span class="G">Auron: Yuna must be trying to send him.</span><br />

<p><span class="L">Lulu: The city of Bevelle is built on the water. There may be underwater fighting. You or Rikku should study your magic, just in case.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Seymour is one of the dead now. Odd. Why does Maester Mika allow the unsent to walk free?</span></p>
<p><span class="M">Cid: They grabbed Yuna back in the Sanubia Desert. One of the Guado squads that attacked Home found her.<br />
