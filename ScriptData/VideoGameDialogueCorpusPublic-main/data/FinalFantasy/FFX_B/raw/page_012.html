<p><span class="stage">[Biran leaps out and bars path. Kelk approaches.]</span><br />
<span class="npc">Kelk: Summoner Yuna and guardians, leave here at once!</span><br />
<span class="stage">[Party looks around; Ronso surround them.]</span><br />
<span class="npc">Kelk: Gagazet is Ronso land, sacred mountain of Yevon. The mountain will not bear the footsteps of infidels!<br />
Biran: Enemy of Yevon is enemy of Ronso! Leave, traitors!</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: I have cast aside Yevon! I&#8230; I follow the temple no more!</span><br />
<span class="npc">Kelk: Then you will die by those words!</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: So be it. Yevon has warped the teachings and betrayed us all!</span><br />
<span class="W">Wakka: Nothing but a bunch of low-down tricksters, eh?</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: Yeah! Yeah!</span><br />
<span class="R">Rikku: Yeah! Yeah!</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: We have no regrets.</span><br />
<span class="npc">Yenke: Blasphemers!<br />
Kelk: A summoners and her guardians&#8230;</span><br />
<span class="L">Lulu: Lord Kelk Ronso, if I may. Have you not also turned your back on Bevelle?</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: But still, you guard Gagazet as a Ronso, not a maester. Yuna is much the same.</span><br />
<span class="npc">Biran: Elder Kelk! Let Biran rend them asunder!<br />
Yenke: No escape! Not one!</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: No, we will not flee. We will fight, and continue on.</span><br />
<span class="npc">Kelk: You have been branded a traitor, but still you would fight Sin? Lost to the temple, hated by the people, yet you continue your pilgrimage? Everything lost! What do you fight for?</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: I fight for Spira. The people long for the Calm. I can give it to them. It&#8217;s all I can give. Defeating Sin, ending pain&#8230;this I can do.</span><br />
<span class="npc">Kelk: Even sacrificing yourself? <span class="mov">(Ponders a while.)</span> Ronso, let them pass! Summoner Yuna, your will is stronger than steel. Tempered steel that even the mightiest Ronso could not hope to bend. Yuna, we bow to your will! Now go! The sacred heights of Gagazet welcome you.</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: We thank you. <span class="mov">(Deep bow)</span> </span></p>
<div class="optional">
<span class="W">Wakka: Gaah, my neck&#8217;s hurtin&#8217;.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: Zanarkand&#8217;s on the other side, huh?</span><br />
<span class="W">Wakka: Yeah&#8230;your home, ya?</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: As if you believed me.</span><br />
<span class="W">Wakka: Hm. Maybe I do. The one on the other side here&#8217;s probably just a pile of rubble, ya? But somewhere out there is your Zanarkand. Somewhere, ya? Yeah, you&#8217;ll be home soon enough!</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: I&#8230;hope you&#8217;re right.</span><br />
<span class="W">Wakka: Yeah! Cheer up! Let&#8217;s do this!</span></p>
<p><span class="W">&#172;Wakka: Better get ready. Ain&#8217;t no shops where we&#8217;re goin&#8217;.</span></p>
<p><span class="R">Rikku: You think of anything yet?<br />
&nbsp;&#172;I&#8230;there&#8217;s just so little time. Uh&#8230; I don&#8217;t know.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Ugh&#8230; This is a toughie&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span class="Y">Yuna: It&#8217;s just a little farther now.</span></p>
<p><span class="L">Lulu: Yuna&#8217;s&#8230;grown stronger.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: Stronger, huh? I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s more like she&#8217;s driven, don&#8217;t you think?</span><br />
<span class="L">Lulu: That&#8217;s why she&#8217;s strong. She&#8217;s still pressing forward. When weak people are driven they can&#8217;t go far before they break. She keeps going forward, because she is strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="L">&#172;Lulu: Yuna has grown strong. And I&#8230; All I can do is try and keep up with her.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Let&#8217;s get ready for the climb.</span></p>
<p><span class="K">Kimahri: Biran and Yenke gone.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: I wonder what they&#8217;re up to? Eh, it&#8217;s probably nothing!</span><br />
<span class="K">Kimahri: Biran is hero of Ronso. Yenke is powerful warrior.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: Great&#8230; I hope we don&#8217;t have to fight them.</span><br />
<span class="K">Kimahri: Kimahri must fight. Kimahri must win.</span></p>
<p><span class="K">&#172;Kimahri: The sacred Gagazet. First time Kimahri climbs.</span></p>
<p><span class="G">Auron: It is as I thought.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: What is?</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: Yevon is in turmoil. Mika tries to keep it whole, but it crumbles around him.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: Look, I couldn&#8217;t care less what happens to Yevon.</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: Because you are not of this world. To those who truly believe in the teachings&#8230; a time of much pain is coming.</span> </p>
<p><span class="G">&#172;Auron: Ten years ago, I looked up at Gagazet from where we stand now.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: My old man say anything?</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: I do not remember. All I could think of was how&#8230; how I might keep Braska alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="G">&#172;Auron: Your duties as guardian will soon end.</span></p>
<p><span class="npc">Maester Kelk: Summoner Yuna&#8217;s words, they ring clear in my soul. Small voice, small frame, but a will that towers over Gagazet&#8217;s peak.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;The path to the sacred heights is steep and lined with the dens of fiends. Strong guardians, be prepared, and guard your summoner well.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Guard your summoner with all your heart.</p>
<p>Female Ronso in yellow: To Ronso, losing horn is greatest disgrace. But hornless Kimahri return to mountain. Why?<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Kimahri stand tall, unashamed. Lose horn, but gain friends.</p>
<p>Female Ronso in red: The cold winds of mountain, sharper than Ronso fangs. It stands in way of weak, and buries them in ice.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Prepare your body and mind. Reach for the peack of the mountain!</p>
<p>Merchant Ronso: The sacred heights of Gagazet shun the weak. Use Ronso weapons! <span class="mov">(Shop)</span></p>
<p>Old Ronso in red kilt by save sphere: Young or old, Ronso all warriors. All must protect sacred mountain. Ronso sharpens fangs, until day of death.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;It is great joy to see Kimahri return after ten years, a mighty Ronso! With this all is well. Praise to Yevon!<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Now, be off. Mount Gagazet awaits.</span></p>
<p><span class="bs"><span class="npc">Ronso in red: Quarrel between Biran and Kimahri started ten years ago. Young Ronso fight each other to show strength. Biran beat Kimahri, but Kimahri never admit losing. Not once. Angry Biran broken Kimahri&#8217;s horn. Kimahri could not bear shame and left sacred mountain.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Kimahri talk less after horn broken.</span></span></div>

<span class="TN">Narration: A city dead for a thousand years. A city I had to see with my own eyes. The end of Yuna&#8217;s journey. The last chapter in my story. </div>
<p><span class="TN">Narration: My thoughts, they kept floating up, and then slipping through my fingers. Slipping away before I could pin them down with words.</span><br />
<span class="R">Rikku: Yuna, I say no! If we go down there, then you&#8217;ll&#8230;</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: Rikku. You&#8217;re a true friend, and I thank you, but&#8230; I must go&#8230;down, to Zanarkand.</span><br />
<span class="R">Rikku: I&#8217;m not saying we shouldn&#8217;t go. But shouldn&#8217;t we think about it some more? There&#8217;s gotta be some kind of way we can save you, Yuna!</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: All my life, I knew this moment would come.</span><br />
<span class="R">Rikku: Yunie&#8230;</span><br />
<span class="stage">[Yuna hugs her, and a sphere slips from the folds of her kimono]</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: Thank you, Rikku. Thank you for everything.</span><br />
<span class="R">Rikku: Don&#8217;t say that, Yunie! It&#8217;s not over yet!</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: Tell Cid thank you.</span><br />
<span class="R">Rikku: No&#8230; You can tell him yourself.</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: Please&#8230;</span><br />
<span class="R">Rikku: Yunie, don&#8217;t say that because&#8230;we&#8217;re gonna see each other again, okay?</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: Kimahri, let&#8217;s go.</span></p>

<span class="Y">Yuna: Sir Auron. Kimahri told me&#8230;when my father wanted me taken from Bevelle to Besaid&#8230; It was you who told Kimahri, right? I had always wanted to meet you someday. I am truly glad that I had that chance. Having you as a guardian was so great an honor I don&#8217;t know how to thank you. Perhaps if I defeat Sin, that will be my thanks to you. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do. Yes. I will challenge Sin. I will defeat Sin. If you are all there watching this, then I guess Sin is already gone. And so am I, I suppose. Anyway, I just wanted to say: Sir Auron, I thank you.</p>
<p>Yuna: Kimahri&#8230;Do you remember the first day we met? I was only seven. My father had defeated Sin, and all Bevelle was celebrating. Everyone was saying what a hero my father was. I was so happy. But when night came, it occurred to me. My father had defeated Sin and now he was dead. Now, I was all alone. I couldn&#8217;t sleep, so I wandered into the town, away from the celebrating crowds. I stood on the bridge in Bevelle where my father and I had parted. Standing there, alone, I could see the fields where he had fought Sin. Then, you appeared, Kimahri. You said you were looking for the daughter of Braska, remember? At first, I was so scared. Until I realized what a gentle person you are. <span class="mov">(Laughs)</span> You weren&#8217;t used to talking to children. When I told you that I was Braska&#8217;s daughter&#8230; you said you would take me as far from Bevelle as you could. That it was the wish of a man facing death. I think&#8230;I cried then. Because that&#8230;that was when I knew my father was dead&#8230;and I would never see him again. You just held me, without saying a word. I cried after we got to Besaid, too. When you tried to go after leaving me in the care of the temple&#8230;I held onto you, crying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t go, don&#8217;t go!&#8221; And you listened, Kimahri. You stayed. Kimahri, thank you. Thank you so much. And I&#8217;ve always liked your broken horn.</p>
<p>Yuna: Wakka, Lulu: I&#8217;ll never forget my days spent with you, growing up in Besaid. We always played together, us and Chappu. That&#8217;s why I was always so happy, I think. And when you refused to let me become a summoner and I did it anyway&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;ve always wanted to apologize. You know, when you tried to stop me then&#8211;really, I was happy. I could tell you really cared about me. You were like my big brother and sister. No&#8230;I think you really were my big brother and sister. What else&#8230; I love watching you play blitzball, Wakka. <span class="mov">(chuckles)</span> I even love it when you scold me, Lulu! Really!</p>
<p>Yuna: I guess that leaves&#8230;the newest guardian. Star player of the Zanarkand Abes! You are&#8230; I am&#8230; Well, um&#8230; I&#8217;m glad&#8230;I&#8217;m glad that we met. We haven&#8217;t even known each other that long, but&#8230; It&#8217;s funny. So&#8230; So this is what it feels like. It&#8217;s a much more wonderful feeling than anything I had ever imagined. Wonderful&#8230;but it hurts, sometimes. I wonder. I&#8230;I just want to say, thank you for everything. Maybe&#8230;maybe that&#8217;s why it hurts. When I&#8230; When I think about us never being together again at all&#8230; I&#8217;m afraid. No, I shouldn&#8217;t say that. I&#8217;ll do that part over. Um&#8230;</span></p>
