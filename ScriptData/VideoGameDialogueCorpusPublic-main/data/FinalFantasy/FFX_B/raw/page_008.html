<span class="G">Auron: You&#8217;re worried about Yuna.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: &#8216;Course I&#8217;m worried about her. What is she thinking?</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: The simplest answer would be&#8230;in exchange for agreeing to marry him&#8230;she hopes to negotiate with Seymour.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: Negotiate what?</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: I wonder.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: What? All by herself?</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: <span class="mov">(Chuckles)</span> She&#8217;s strong, but Seymour is the better negotiator.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: Well then, why don&#8217;t we do something about it?</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: Yuna wants it this way.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: Argh! I just don&#8217;t get it! Doesn&#8217;t she trust us?</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: On the contrary&#8230; She doesn&#8217;t want us caught up in whatever it is that she&#8217;s planning.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: Yeah, that&#8217;s what I thought. But that makes me worry even more. She could just tell us.</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: That&#8217;s the way she is. She&#8217;s naive, serious to a fault, and doesn&#8217;t ask for help.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: You&#8217;re probably right.</span><br />

<span class="TN">Narration: It&#8217;s funny how calm I was. Maybe it was because I realized that Yuna wasn&#8217;t marrying Seymour for love. Not really. It was just her duty&#8211;something she had to do before returning to her pilgrimage. That&#8217;s what I kept telling myself, anyway. And well, maybe&#8230; I realized that Yuna and I&#8217;d never&#8230; You know&#8230;</span><br />

<span class="R">Rikku: <span class="mov">(Bops Tidus)</span> Hey, don&#8217;t change the subject!</span><br />
<span class="K">Kimahri: We climb.</span><br />
<span class="R">Rikku: Kimahri, too!</span><br />
<span class="K">Kimahri: Only those who try will become.</span><br />
<span class="R">Rikku: Huh?</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: I think he means you have to work hard if you want to be like Lulu.</span><br />
<span class="R">Rikku: Oh! I will!</span><br />
<span class="K">Kimahri: Kimahri think Rikku should stay Rikku.</span><br />
<span class="R">Rikku: Huh? Hey! Are you saying I&#8217;ll never be like Rikku! Kimahri!</span><br />
<span class="T"><span class="mov">(Laughs)</span></span><br />
<span class="W">Wakka: How can you laugh at a time like this!?</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: <span class="mov">(Stirs)</span></span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: Yuna!</span></p>
<p><span class="stage">[Slight fast forward, guardians gathered around Yuna]</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: I wanted to confront Maester Seymour about his father, Lord Jyscal. I wanted to convince him to turn himself into Yevon&#8217;s judgement.</span><br />
<span class="L">Lulu: In exchange for marriage?</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: Yes, if that&#8217;s what it took.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: So, what did Seymour say?</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: He didn&#8217;t say anything. Now&#8230;now I don&#8217;t even think it was worth it. I should&#8217;ve told you what I was going to do.</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: Enough. Dwelling in the past is futile.</span><br />
<span class="R">Rikku: Hey! You don&#8217;t have to say it like that!</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: You want to waste time listening to her regrets?</span><br />
<span class="R">Rikku: You don&#8217;t have to say it like that.</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: Our immediate concern is Yuna&#8217;s pilgrimage. Are you willing to go on?</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: Yes. But then, do you think Yevon will allow it?</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: The fayth are the ones that give power to the summoners. Not the temples or the teachings. If the temples try to stop us&#8230;then we will defy Yevon if we must.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: Whoa!</span><br />
<span class="R">Rikku: I can&#8217;t believe you said that!</span><br />
<span class="L">Lulu: Sir Auron!?</span><br />
<span class="W">Wakka: Count me out. We have to atone, to make up for the sins we have committed. Of course&#8230;it&#8217;s not like I ever liked Maester Seymour, ya? No way I&#8217;ll ever forgive him for killing Lord Jyscal&#8230;and for trying to do us all in too, you know? But still, the bunch of us going against Yevon? No way!</span><br />
<span class="L">Lulu: But still, we have transgressed and must face our punishment.</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: We must go to <font color="#0000aa">Bevelle</font>. We must speak with Maester Mika and explain what has happened. There is no other way, I think.</span><br />
<span class="W">Wakka: I agree.</span><br />
<span class="L">Lulu: Mm. <span class="mov">(nods)</span> </span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: Sir Auron&#8230;</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: So it is decided.</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: Will you come with us?</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: I am the troublemaker, after all.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: Yeah, that&#8217;s right! You can always count on Auron to complicate things!</span><br />
<span class="R">Rikku: Yeah! Kimahri roars, and Auron runs off, and&#8230;</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: I never asked you to follow me.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: Hey, but that&#8217;s what friends are for. Right?</span><br />
<span class="R">Rikku: Yep!</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: <span class="mov">(To Tidus)</span> Thank you.</span><br />
<span class="R">Rikku: Friends, huh?</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: <span class="mov">(Chuckles )</span></span><br />
<span class="W">Wakka: Man&#8230; How can you all act like nothing&#8217;s wrong? Must got nerves of steel or something.</span><br />
<span class="L">Lulu: You&#8217;re too edgy. Listen to the hymn and calm down.</span><br />
<span class="stage">[They scatter, each left to his own thoughts. A woman&#8217;s voice is singing the Hymn of the Fayth in the background.]</span></p>
<p><span class="T">Tidus: Is that coming from the temple?</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: Yes, it is Yevon&#8217;s gift. <span class="mov">(Yevon bow)</span> It soothes the hearts of the faithful.</span></p>
<div class="optional">
<span class="W">Wakka: Say, you feel something weird in the air? Some kind of bad vibes or something.</span>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">
<li class="choice">Yeah!</li>

</ul>
<p><span class="W">&#172;Wakka: I feel really weird.</span></p>
<p><span class="R">Rikku: Heh heh. Friends, huh? First time a non-Al Bhed called me that.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Ee-hee-hee.</span></p>
<p><span class="T">Tidus: Who is that singing?</span><br />
<span class="L">Lulu: The fayth.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: Oooh&#8230;. Huh? The fayth? What? It can sing?</span><br />
<span class="L">Lulu: Of course it can. Don&#8217;t be a fool.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Say, isn&#8217;t the ground shaking?</span></p>
<p><span class="Y">Yuna: I&#8217;m sure that Maester Mika will listen to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="K">Kimahri: This place smell different now. Kimahri not know if this good or bad.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Kimahri feel no danger.</span>
</div>
<p><span class="G">Auron: Jecht used to sing this song&#8230;</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: Yeah, over and over. <span class="mov">(Laughs)</span> But not this good, that&#8217;s for sure.</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: Another trait you share.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: Huh? What, were you listening?</span></p>
<div class="flashback">
<h4 class="sc">[Flashback: Zanarkand dock. Tidus humming, Auron off-screen.]</h4>
<p><span class="T">Tidus: Eesh&#8230; Can&#8217;t I get a little privacy?</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: Your singing reminded me of Spira.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: Oh, right. You&#8217;re not originally from Zanarkand, are you? You homesick?</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: Maybe.</span></div>
<p><span class="T">Tidus: Say, how&#8217;d you get to Zanarkand, anyway? Sin?</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: &#8230;</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: Uh-huh, I thought so.<br />
Tidus: That proved it. Sin was the link between Zanarkand and Spira. Which means, if we kill Sin, I&#8217;ll never be able to go home.</span><br />
<span class="G">&#172;Auron: We should get moving soon.</span><br />
<span class="stage">[Eerie silence.]</span><br />
<span class="R">Rikku: Hmm?</span><br />
<span class="L">Lulu: The singing stopped.</span><br />
<span class="stage">[Rrrumble&#8230;]</span><br />

<span class="stage">[Confusing jumble of images, then everything goes fuzzy]</span><br />
<span class="TN">Narration: It was then I knew&#8230;that Sin really was my old man. For the first time, I was finally able to believe it.</span><br />
