<span class="npc">Announcer (Bobba): &#8230;he shoots&#8230;gooooooaaaaallll! Unbelievable! Ladies and gentleman, the day we&#8217;ve all been waiting for, the opening tournament of the season. This event is sponsored by Yevon. And this year we celebrate Maester Mika&#8217;s 50th year in office!</span>

<span class="npc">Announcer (Bobba): Ah, over there! The ships carrying the players are arriving now! This would be dock number 2. All the way from Kilika, it&#8217;s the Kilika Beasts! High Summoner Ohalland used to play for them&#8211;a big name to live up to. Their hometown was recently attacked by Sin. Isn&#8217;t that right, Jimma?<br />
Color Guy (Jimma): Yes, Bobba. They&#8217;re going to be pulling out all the stops to try and bring back the cup this year.<br />
Bobba: Exciting, isn&#8217;t it folks? Our next team off the ramp is&#8230;Well, well, well! If it isn&#8217;t the Besaid Aurochs! They&#8217;re a living, breathing statistical impossibility! I&#8217;ve never seen a team this bad! That&#8217;s right! In twenty-three years they&#8217;ve never made it past the first round! Only a few die-hard fans are in the audience today.<br />
Jimma: Best of luck to them and a safe journey back to Besaid.<br />
Bobba: Right, Jimma. Moving right along, our next team is&#8230; Here they are, folks! Our very own Luca Goers! They&#8217;ve got power! They&#8217;ve got speed! They&#8217;ve got teamwork! They&#8217;re an all-around first-class team! And they&#8217;re back home in Luca!<br />
Jimma: Without a doubt, they are the favorite this year, Bobba. And after the way they dominated last year, it&#8217;d take a miracle for them to lose today.<br />
Bobba: You can say that again, Jimma. Look at the crowd, folks! Look at the crowd! Looks like all of Luca has turned out to cheer the Goers on! They know, I know, and you know, folks! The Luca Goers are number one!</span><br />
