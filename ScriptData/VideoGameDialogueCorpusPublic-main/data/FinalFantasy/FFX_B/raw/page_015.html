<span class="Y">Yuna: <span class="mov">(Shakes head)</span> No&#8230;</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: Yuna, I have to go. I&#8217;m sorry I couldn&#8217;t show you Zanarkand. <span class="mov">(Starts walking away)</span> Goodbye!</span><br />

<span class="R">Rikku: We&#8217;re gonna see you again&#8230;?</span><br />

<span class="Y">Yuna: Everyone&#8230;everyone has lost something precious. Everyone here has lost homes, dreams, and friends. Everybody&#8230; Now, Sin is finally dead. Now, Spira is ours again. Working together&#8230; Now we can make new homes for ourselves, and new dreams. Although I know the journey will be hard, we have lots of time. Together, we will rebuild Spira. The road is ahead of us, so let&#8217;s start out today. Just, one more thing&#8230; The people and the friends that we have lost, or the dreams that have faded&#8230;</p>
<p><span class="stage">[Significant moments in Yuna&#8217;s past flash by, lingering on the scene at the spring in Macalania. A pyrefly drifts past Yuna&#8217;s cheek and the screen goes dark on her final words&#8230;]</span><br />
Yuna: Never forget them.</span></div>
