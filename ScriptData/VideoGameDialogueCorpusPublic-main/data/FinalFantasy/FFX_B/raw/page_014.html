<p>Daddy the fisherman: The temple&#8217;s so busy chasing traitors they&#8217;ve left Sin alone. It will be a long time yet before I can feel safe going out to sea.</p>
<p>Woman in green skirt: Operation Mi&#8217;ihen was a crushing loss for the Crusaders, but they&#8217;re rallying together from every land. Much better than those warrior monks. They&#8217;re all holed up in Bevelle, I hear.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;It&#8217;s funny that the Crusaders are the ones protecting us, even after being excommunicated.</p>
<p>Tiny nun by door of temple: I came to this island all the way from Bevelle to stop you. But from what everyone here says, I find it hard to believe you&#8217;re traitors! Warrior monks are waiting in the temple. Better leave before they notice you.<br />

<p>Botta: I-I&#8217;ll always be on Yuna&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>Datto: No one&#8217;s gonna believe that Yuna is a traitor, man.</p>
<p>Jassu: I already knew about Yuna&#8217;s lineage. I just kept my mouth shut in front of Wakka.</p>
<p>Letty: The temple has pardoned the Crusaders. It&#8217;s a little late for that, ya?</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Luca Stadium Stands</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Winter-wrapped woman (Svanda?): So many people&#8230;Much more than in the Calm Lands.</p>
<p>Man wrapped up in long brown coat: Such a free-spirited city&#8230; I do not wish to return to Bevelle.</p>
<p>Crusader: I&#8217;m off duty. Let me be.</p>
<p>Al Bhed in khaki: nothing beats watching a blitz game after a long stint at sea.</p>
<p>Female sailor: I&#8217;ve seen many things in my time at sea, but nothing like that flying ship at dock number 1.</p>
<p>Lefthand guard in stands: People from all over Spira gather here. The monks of Yevon, the Al Bhed, Crusaders, warrior monks, Ronso, Guado, you name it. People of different cultures and values come together as one to cheer on blitzball. There is no other place in Spira as wonderful as this.</p>
<p>Righthand guard in stands: The warrior monks have left, but the Crusaders are back to help guard the area.</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">In Front of Stadium</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Stadium entrance guard, left (Biggs): The people of Luca will always stand behind blitzer&#8211; even one condemned as a traitor.</p>
<p>Stadium entrance guard, right (Wedge): Most of the warrior monks have withdrawn to Bevelle, but some have taken a liking to Luca and remained here.</p>
<p>Crusader sitting on bench (new guy, green and gold): Even through all the hardship, the people of Luca enjoy blitzball and carry on with their lives. Oh, how I admire their strength.</p>
<p>Female Crusader on bench (new, faded blue outfit): The merchants of Luca have raised money to support the Crusaders.</p>
<p>Crusader in dark purple: Once the Crusaders regroup in Luca, they will charge through the Mi&#8217;ihen Highroad and lay waste to all the fiends!</p>
<p>Woman in pom-pom hat: Did you know that you&#8217;re more popular than ever, now that you&#8217;re branded as a traitor?</p>
<p>Luca guard (gray): The warrior monks have left, but the Crusaders have returned to serve as guards. A blessing from Yevon indeed!</p>
<p>Luca guard (blue): The Crusaders will help us with security. We will support them all the way!</p>
<p>Crusader in need of pants: I quit the Crusaders after the operation, but I&#8217;m back in again. I think I have Crusader blood running through my veins.</p>
<p>Al Bhed in bright red vest: The flying ship at dock 1 is the legendary airship! So the tales are true!</p>
<p>Al Bhed in brown vest: I think the Crusaders are more suited to Luca than the warrior monks are.</p>
<p>Al Bhed woman in red (Nhadala): Hey, when are you playin&#8217; next? I really want to see you again.</p>
<p>Guy in white and blue: I&#8217;ve decided to join the Crusaders. No sense hiding behind their back all the time.</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Luca, Dock number 1 (airship docked)</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Man wrapped in long brown coat: I ran out of Bevelle as fast as I could, so I didn&#8217;t pack any summer clothes.</p>
<p>Crusader patrolling: Th-That flying ship&#8230;Have the Al Bhed finally brough out their big guns? I hope they will avenge the fallen Crusaders for me!</p>
<p>Al Bhed in gas mask: <span class="AB">I will not ride the airship. I get airsick easily.</span></p>
<p>Hypello adult: I wonderss what that ship ish? An anshient mashina?</p>
<p>Hypello child: Thish ish a big ribber. You shink shoopuf can make it here okay?</p>
<p>Man in green and white: Is it true that the temple is in chaos? I don&#8217;t believe that one bit!</p>
<p>Man in white and blue: I hear Lady Yuna&#8217;s wedding was called off.</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Luca, dock number 2 (ferry docked)</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Little Crusader: Nothing out of the ordinary, sir!</p>
<p>Female Crusader by ferry: With the warrior monks gone, it&#8217;s up to us Crusaders to defend Luca.</p>
<p>Female Crusader on opposite side: Whenever guard duty gets boring, I try to remember how much the Crusaders need me right now.</p>
<p>Little boy: Sis once got caught trying to sneak onto that ferry.</p>
<p>Little girl: I want to be a sailor and sail all over Spira when I grow up.</p>
<p>Old woman: I tell her how dangerous it is out on the ocean, but she never listens.</p>
<p>Busy female sailor: Hey, hey, outta my way! I&#8217;m tryin&#8217; to work here!</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Luca Dock Number 3 (No ship docked)</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Bickson: Whether you&#8217;re a traitor or not means nothing in the sphere pool.</p>
<p>Abus: Rumor has it that you guys are traitors. Some people sure talk rubbish.</p>
<p>Graav: We&#8217;re going to keep on blitzing no matter what becomes of the temple.</p>
<p>Raudy: Both the Ronso and the Al Bhed teams play extra hard to help cheer their fans up.</p>
<p>Balgerda: What in Spira&#8217;s name is the temple thinking these days?</p>
<p>Doram: You always seem to be walking around. When do you have time to practice?</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Luca, dock number 4 (no ship docked)</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Al Bhed woman in red: A flying ship, huh? What will they think of next?</p>
<p>Little Crusader near screen: I may be enjoying the game, but I&#8217;m keeping watch, too. Everything&#8217;s okay here!</p>
<p>Crusader in purple: Those Ronso players are massive! I feel like they&#8217;re here to guard us instead of the other way around.</p>
<p>Gazna Ronso: Maester Kelk Ronso was slain while defending the mountain. For Ronso, no better way to die.</p>
<p>Argai Ronso: If Ronso Fangs win, our brothers on the Farplane will rejoice.</p>
<p>Basik Ronso: Ronso shed no tear when brothers die. Pain and sorrow will never conquer mighty Ronso spirit.</p>
<p>Nuvy Ronso: The Crusaders stand strong once more. We admire their fortitude.</p>
<p>Zamzi Ronso: No longer can temple help us. Must protect Spira on our own.</p>
<p>Irga Ronso: Ronso are pious race. But cannot trust temple now.</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Luca, dock number 5</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Islander woman in halter top: This dock is so quiet compared to the others.</p>
<p>Short nun: I was lost when I left the temple, not knowing what to believe anymore.</p>
<p>Zev Ronso: Warrior monks run away to Bevelle. They abandon the people. Should hide their faces in shame.</p>
<p>Woman in white and blue: There&#8217;s a flying ship at dock number 1! Why don&#8217;t you go check it out?</p>
<p>Crusader guard: If guard duty&#8217;s taught me anything, it&#8217;s the importance of checking every nook and cranny. Trust me, it pays off.</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Luca, Causeway to Mainland</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Pair of warrior monks near Stadium:<br />
-You! You&#8217;re that traitor!<br />
-Let him go. Even the two of us won&#8217;t be able to overpower him.<br />
-But, what about our duties to the temple?<br />
-Our duties? We missed the ship to Bevelle! They&#8217;re not coming back for us! We&#8217;re nothing now!<br />
&nbsp;&#172;You&#8217;d probably kick my butt anyway.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;We wear the armor of the temple, but it doesn&#8217;t mean a thing. </p>
<p>Little beaky guy in red: The city of Luca keeps on blitzin&#8217;, even with all the turmoil goin&#8217; on these days. Even the faltering of the Yevon temple won&#8217;t change that.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Even if Sin were to attack today, the people of Luca would probably be more interested in tomorrow&#8217;s match.</p>
<p>Guy in red shorts: I hear the warrior monks invaded Besaid. They were looking for some traitors.</p>
<p>Kilika Beasts fan in white pants: I&#8217;m just worried that Sin might attack Kilika again.</p>
<p>Mother in tan and orange: I saw a flying ship at dock number 1. Think that&#8217;s gonna beat Sin?</p>
<p>Priest: Some of Luca&#8217;s residents are making light of the teachings. What sacrilege.</p>
<p>Priestess: The Macalania temple is losing its faith. I do not wish to live there anymore.</p>
<p>Man in yellow and green: The temple&#8217;s probably devising a grand plan. That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re not doing anything right now.</p>
<p>Woman in blue: Those warrior monks were useless. They didn&#8217;t do a thing.</p>
<p>Man in green shirt, brown overalls: The flying ship is a forbidden machina, but we should just get it approved by the temple.</p>
<p>Man on bench: The temple is in a state of chaos, but we must remain strong and keep faith in the  teachings as we wait for the Calm.</p>
<p>Man in blue vest: The only thing the people can really do is to pray for the Calm.</p>
<p>Woman in green skirt sitting: I hear the mood in Guadosalam is just as gloomy as the Farplane.</p>
<p>Woman in yellow talking to her: I&#8217;m glad the Crusaders are in high spirits, but I&#8217;m just worried they&#8217;ll come up with another reckless plan.</p>
<p>Reporter (Shaami): Even as faith in the Yevon clergy dwindles, the temple remains silent, choosing not to issue any official statement on the matter. Many are protesting the cold and insensitive manner in which the temple has treated the people. There have even been reports of a mass exodus from Bevelle by dejected temple followers&#8230; Wh-What do you think you&#8217;re doing!? Can&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m working here? You sure are a show-off, aren&#8217;t you!<br />
&nbsp;&#172;We have unconfirmed reports that Maester Seymour has committed an unspeakable crime&#8230; Will you move!?</p>
<p>Cameraman: If you want to be interviewed, show us your most outrageous gag, okay?</p>
<p>Woman on mainland side of causeway: Sin hasn&#8217;t attacked lately. That&#8217;s making me even more nervous.</p>
<p>Portly man with her (always worried about ferry): Having that airship would make travelling between Luca and Kilika a lot easier&#8230;</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Side-Bridge to Sphere Theater</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Little nun: The monks have been looking stern lately. I wonder what&#8217;s gonna happen to the temple?</p>
<p>Ex-sailor (Zalitz): I quit the sailor&#8217;s life because I&#8217;m terrified of Sin. I&#8217;m too ashamed to face my shipmates.</p>
<p>Macho sailor: Those stuck-up warrior monks ran back to Bevelle crying for their mommies. Spineless bastards!</p>
<h4 class="sc">Sphere Theater Front Entrance</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Hypello: Thish ishn&#8217;t the shtadium&#8230;? I shink I&#8217;m losht.</p>
<p>Young hypello looking at frog guy: That drummer lookss like ush&#8230; Maybe he&#8217;s a big relative of Hypello?</p>
<p>Adult Crusader (back by the data console): Gathering data for travellers is an important part of a Crusader&#8217;s duties, too.</p>
<p>Little Crusader: A fiend might be attracted to the music! Keep your eyes open and stay alert!</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Luca Main Square</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Female Crusader in red: Luca is a free city. The fiends could have snuck in from anywhere.</p>
<p>Lucan guard in brown: Maester Kinoc was always concerned for the safety of the people. It&#8217;s a shame to have lost him.</p>
<p>Guado girl in purple: I don&#8217;t want to go back to Guadosalam because it reminds me of my brother. (one of Seymour&#8217;s former guards)</p>
<p>Man in green and white (&#8220;spoony bard&#8221;): The warrior monk? She&#8217;s not around anymore. I missed my chance at her.</p>
<p>Opportunistic woman in green: I can&#8217;t do business with the temple the way it is. I hope they get their act together soon.</p>
<p>Woman in pom-pom hat: The defeated Al Bhed are now staying at different travel agencies.</p>
<p>Chunky guy in green outside cafe: Even the temple makes mistakes. The monks are only human, after all.<br />
Woman in gold with brown leggings: I wonder how the wedding was? Haven&#8217;t heard anything from the temple yet.</span><br />
Man in white pants: Where have the Crusaders been hiding? After that battle they just disappeared&#8230;<br />
Woman in purple by vendor: What&#8217;s wrong with the temple these days? They&#8217;re hopeless when we need them most!</p>
<p>Little girl with balloon: There&#8217;s a flying ship at the port! That&#8217;s a forbidden machina, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Father on bench (Jumal): Not all of the Crusaders are armed well. They seem inferior to the warrior monks.</p>
<p>Mother on bench: My husband likes the warrior monks, but I simply can&#8217;t bear them.</p>
<p>Woman in green skirt: I don&#8217;t know much about religion, but there&#8217;s something weird about the temple.</p>
<p>Man in blue vest: Hurray! With the Crusaders back I feel like we could take on two Sins!</p>
<p>Seated guard: The warrior monks left Luca without a word. Who do they think they are?</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Luca Cafe</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Beaky guy in purple: I heard that the Guado razed the Al Bhed&#8217;s hometown. That&#8217;s horrible!</p>
<p>Drunk in khaki on the left: I shouldn&#8217;t say this out loud, but the temples are way outta line! Dang it, I said it out loud&#8230;</p>
<p>Warrior monk and Crusader at bar:<br />
-The temple is a wreck. I really want to quit the warrior monks.<br />
-Then join the Crusaders! We&#8217;d love to have you join our force.</p>
<p>&#172;Crusader: I&#8217;d like to recruit as many as possible and rebuild the Crusaders.<br />
&#172;Warrior monk: Never expected that the Crusaders would try to recruit me. Not in a million years.</p>
<p>Woman in blue: The high summoner&#8217;s daughter would never turn traitor. The temple must be mistaken.</p>
<p>Woman in red (Shuu): Is Lady Yuna a traitor or not? With everyone gabbing, I don&#8217;t know what to believe.</p>
<p>Luca guard in gray: We should hold a blitzball tournament to aid Yevon in this time of crisis.</p>
<p>Luca guard in brown: The temple&#8217;s in chaos? Really? That&#8217;s too bad, but we&#8217;ve got other problems to worry about, like blitzball.</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Balcony Overlooking Luca</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Crusader on steps into Luca: The Crusaders are guarding the stadium. If any fiends appear, we&#8217;ll destroy them even if it means our lives.</p>
<p>Crusader patrolling on the balcony: The youth of Luca are flocking to the Crusaders in droves! Lord Mi&#8217;ihen would be proud.</p>
<p>Guy with Crusader&#8217;s dog and cat: There are so many people fleeing Bevelle. They say it&#8217;s utter chaos over there.</span></div>
<h3 class="where">Mi&#8217;ihen Highroad</h3>
<div class="backtrack">
<h4 class="sc">Southern End of Highroad</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Man in green and purple: Fiends are lurking everywhere. I have to be on my toes constantly.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;They really need to guard the Highroad better. The Crusaders, the warrior monks. I don&#8217;t care who handles it, as long as it&#8217;s safe.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;I suppose it&#8217;s too much to ask to secure a remote area like this one. Out here, it&#8217;s every man for himself.</p>
<p>Woman in blue and yellow at railing: I see a large shadow in the sky sometimes. It&#8217;s too big to be a bird. What could it be?<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Maybe&#8230;Nah, it can&#8217;t be.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;I wonder if somebody&#8217;s riding that thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="clue"><span class="npc">Man in green and white: There are seven legends about Lord Mi&#8217;ihen&#8217;s statue&#8230; but they&#8217;re all so absurd!<br />
&nbsp;&#172;They say that they eyes follow you when you&#8217;re not looking, and that it gets up and walks around in the night! Silly, isn&#8217;t it?<br />
&nbsp;&#172;There&#8217;s a legend that Lord Mi&#8217;ihen&#8217;s sword still exists somewhere. I think it&#8217;s just an ancient myth.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="npc">Portly man in white vest: This is a statue of Lord Mi&#8217;ihen, who founded the Crusaders several hundred years ago. Lord Mi&#8217;ihen passed along this very road on his way to St. Bevelle. Ever since then, this road has been known as the Mi&#8217;ihen Highroad.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Lord Mi&#8217;ihen faithfully followed the teachings, unlike the Crusaders these days.</p>
<p>Man standing in ruins of hollow tower: There&#8217;s gotta be something here&#8230;I can feel it. But no matter how hard I look, I can&#8217;t find a thing.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;There should be inscriptions of some sort here. Aw, well&#8230; I probably wouldn&#8217;t be able to read them anyway.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Hey! What&#8217;s that? Ha! Made you look!</span></p>
<p><span class="clue"><span class="sign">Inside the ruined tower:<br />
<span class="AB">There is a valley in a vast plain with a great thorn beside. From the thorn look cross the vale to the other side.</span></span></span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Mi&#8217;ihen Highroad &#8212; South</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Woman in purple apron: I fled Bevelle and came here. I got sick of living there. It was so unsettling, what with the priests&#8217; meddling and the warrior monks&#8217; arrogance.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Yevon had better start getting its act together.</p>
<p>Little girl in red shorts: I&#8217;m not running, I&#8217;m practicing with my brother.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;It&#8217;s important to train. You never know what&#8217;s gonna happen.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;I have to become strong like my brother so that I&#8217;ll be able to run away like him if fiends attack us.</p>
<p>Man in green shirt and brown overalls: My sister wanted to play, so we came here. I just didn&#8217;t expect to see so many fiends.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;I&#8217;ll have no problems outrunning the fiends, but I doubt my sister could. I&#8217;m gonna pray we don&#8217;t run into any.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;If there were no fiends in Spira, we wouldn&#8217;t even have to worry about this.</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Mi&#8217;ihen Highroad, Central</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Spikey-haired Al Bhed: <span class="AB">Our home was blown to smithereens. I am trying not to think about it.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;It is good to take a walk like this. Sometimes I catch the rascal who scribbles graffiti in Al Bhed.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;You probably do not know what I am saying. I am sorry to waste your time.</span></p>
<p>Man in white and blue: The collapse of the Crusaders, the conflict in Bevelle&#8230;I fear for Spira&#8217;s future.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;All we can do is trust the summoners. I feel so helpless.</p>
<p>Woman in tan and orange: You look awful depressed, and it&#8217;s such a beautiful day.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;When I&#8217;m feeling down, I come here and take a walk. Nothing like a breath of fresh air to clear your mind.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;There are some things that can&#8217;t be helped.</p>
<p>Barechested guy in shorts slumped over by a column: Sorry, I don&#8217; feel like talking anymore.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Just leave me alone.</p>
<p>Woman near billboard: There are more and more Al Bheds coming here. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s good or bad.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;I&#8217;m still not comfortable being around Al Bhed. Maybe I should get to know them, but I don&#8217;t speak the language.</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">By the Mi&#8217;ihen Travel Agency</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Al Bhed woman in bikini: <span class="AB">We got off the ship with the children under the orders of Elder Cid. The elder probably senses it will be a tough battle.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;I pray for your safety. I do not wish harm on any more people.</span></p>
<p>Al Bhed child (blue pants): <span class="AB">A fiend tried to attack us, but Mom blew it away with machina. Don&#8217;t make her angry. You don&#8217;t want to see her when she is angry.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Is this our new Home?</span></p>
<p>Al Bhed Kid on ocean overlook: <span class="AB">That is the biggest puddle I have ever seen!<br />
&nbsp;&#172;There are many unusual plants. I wonder how they taste.</span></p>
<p>Al Bhed woman in leggings: <span class="AB">The children are happy. Everything is so new to them.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;I must watch over the children. It is dangerous here. They could fall off the cliff.</span></span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Inside Mi&#8217;ihen Travel Agency</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Bearded Al Bhed: <span class="AB">I told them I could fight, but they said to get off the ship. Cid has become quite the fox treating me like an old man.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Rin is up there, so he&#8217;ll keep an eye on Cid.</span></p>
<p>Crusader in yellow and rust: I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll see our fellow Crusaders if we wait here. We can&#8217;t depend on the temple, so I guess it&#8217;s all on us.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;We owe the Al Bhed so much for all their help. I&#8217;d like to repay them someday.</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Mi&#8217;ihen New Road, South End</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Monk on bridge: It was time for me to leave the temple and travel the world. Along the way, I hope to spread the teachings to the people I meet.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Also, I plan to learn Al Bhed. Nothing will be solved unless we begin a dialog.</p>
<p>Female Crusader in blue on bridge: We are receiving many refugees from Bevelle. They have suffered a trying journey here, and it is our duty to protect them from fiends.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;The warrior monks were guarding the Highroad just recently. Now they&#8217;re gone. How irresponsible of them.</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Mi&#8217;ihen New Road, Central</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Al Bhed child kneeling: <span class="AB">We live in the desert, so I have never seen so many flowers.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;I like the flower here and the flower in the desert. I like them both.</span></p>
<p>Man in green and purple looking at child: There are some Al Bhed wandering around. What are they up to now?<br />
&nbsp;&#172;The Al Bhed wouldn&#8217;t be acting so big if the warrior monks were here.</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Mi&#8217;ihen Highroad, North end (gates)</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Crusader in green and gold: There aren&#8217;t many guards beyond here, so watch it.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Ideally, we&#8217;d like to station men at the Mushroom Rock Road, too. But we&#8217;re really shorthanded. Please understand.</p>
<p>Crusader in red, white and blue: We&#8217;ve been so busy with guard duty, we&#8217;ve been using that cage as shelter. Praise be to Yevon that nobody cleared it after the operation.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;The Al Bhed from the travel agency bring us food now and then. I still don&#8217;t understand them, but they&#8217;re my friends so long as they feed us.</p>
<p>Woman in blue: The warrior monks and the Guado guarding this area have left. Maybe they went after the traitors.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;I guess the Crusaders are the only ones we can really count on.</span>

&nbsp;&#172;No Guado has the strength to weave dark conspiracies any more.</p>

&nbsp;&#172;Years later, Lord Seymour returned. He said his mother had died. But he was no longer the lost child banish&#8217;d so long ago. He had returned a master of the summoner&#8217;s art. The half-breed boy once so reviled thus reversed his fortunes and won deep respect.<br />

&nbsp;&#172;It was Maester Seymour&#8217;s plan to release the fiends in Luca Stadium. He thought he could win the trust of the people by defeating the fiends with his aeon. I heard that his plan to marry the high summoner&#8217;s daughter was solely to gain the support of the people of Yevon. There seem to have been other reasons as well, but now, we will never know.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;By obeying Maester Seymour, we Guado have committed an inexcusable crime. It&#8217;s far too late to try shifting the blame to Maester Seymour. Within time, the Guado will be as despised as the Al Bhed.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;That child&#8217;s brother was Maester Seymour&#8217;s subordinate. He died while invading the Al Bhed hideout, searching for the lost summoners. He was never sent&#8230; I fear he now wanders as a fiend.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;The power of the Guado has greatly deteriorated. They merely await the inevitable, now. That is why I brought that child and moved away from Guadosalam. Perhaps we will find peace in some far away land.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;I still haven&#8217;t told that child the truth about the Guado. Perhaps when he grows older and can accept the reality of the situation&#8230;only then will I reveal the truth about everything to him.<br />

On the eve of Zanarkand&#8217;s destruction, Lady Yunalesca&#8230;  had fled to safety with her husband, Zaon. Later, the two used the Final Summoning to defeat Sin. Yet the people of Bevelle still feared Yu Yevon. It was to quell his wrath that they revered him, and first spread his teachings. And so were born the temples of Yevon. I suppose it&#8217;s possible Yunalesca had planned it that way from the start! A fair trade, she defeats Sin in exchange for her lord father&#8217;s honor. Of course, there&#8217;s no proof. No, the facts are lost in the mists of time. And who&#8217;d admit Yevon was an enemy of Bevelle? You can bet the temples had a hand in covering that one up! And that, as they say, is that.</span></li>

<li class="reply"><span class="M">Maechen: Let me tell you about the Hymn of the Fayth. It was once a Zanarkand song, sung in defiance of Bevelle! Of course, the Yevon clergy of Bevelle forbade it. Then, as these things often go, those who disliked Yevon began to sing it. The Al Bhed, for instance. The Hymn of the Fayth became the symbol of defiance against Yevon. Yevon could do nothing but capitulate. They lifted the ban on the song, and spread a new story. They said the hymn was a song sung to soothe the souls of the dead. And so saying, they took the song and made it scripture. That&#8217;s why today, the hymn is sung all over Spira. You could say that, though Zanarkand is gone from this world, it lives on in the song. Aaaah, but look at the time. I&#8217;ve rambled on again. I do love stories, you see. Well, I owe you my gratitude for hearing this old scholar out.</span></li>

&nbsp;&#172;Baaj is a place of mystery. Mystery worth exploring, no?<br />
