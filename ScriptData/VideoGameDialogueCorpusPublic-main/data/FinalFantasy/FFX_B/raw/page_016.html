<span class="W">Wakka: Oh, the traitor Omega, ya?</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: Omega&#8217;s loathing of Yevon has turned him into a fiend.</span><br />
<span class="W">Wakka: They say he liked it underground, out of the light.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: So he&#8217;s here?</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: Scared?</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: Not a chance!</span></p>

<span class="stage">[After they&#8217;ve dealt with it&#8230;]</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: That was not Omega. Just a shadow, born from Omega&#8217;s wrath.</span><br />
<span class="W">Wakka: What, so the main man&#8217;s still around?</span><br />

<span class="npc">Seymour&#8217;s mother: He was always alone&#8211;half Guado, half man. I wanted to give him the strength to live by himself. And so I became a fayth.<br />
But&#8230; because I let him taste power, he began to thirst for more. He was not satisfied with my aeon. He wanted more. More power.</span><br />
<span class="stage">[Vision ends]</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: And he found Sin.</span><br />
<span class="npc">Seymour&#8217;s mother: Yes. Come, summoner. I will bestow you with my power: The Dark Aeon, Anima. Destroy Sin, and my son&#8217;s obsession with it. Though it is small recompense for what I did to him.</span></p>

<p><span class="M">Belgemine: Welcome, Yuna.</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: What is this place?</span><br />
<span class="M">Belgemine: Remiem Temple. Once a great religious center in the Calm Lands, lost after the battle with Sin.</span><br />
<span class="T">Tidus: And this is your home? What? You got something against company?</span><br />

<span class="T">Tidus: You&#8217;re dead, too?</span><br />
<span class="M">Belgemine: Don&#8217;t send me just yet. There is still one thing left for me to do here. With the help I can give, a young summoner might just be able to defeat Sin. Well, Yuna?</span></p>
<p><span class="tri">Each time you visit, she phrases challenge differently: </span><br />
<span class="M">Belgemine: I challenge you: if you cannot beat me, you&#8217;ll never beat Sin.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;If you&#8217;ve got what it takes to beat Sin, I should be no more than a bump in your path, right?<br />
&nbsp;&#172;I will be the judge of your aeons&#8217; strength. Are you good enough, I wonder?<br />
&nbsp;&#172;You&#8217;ve got quite a name to live up to, daughter of Braska.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Well, Yuna, shall we see how well your training serves you?</span></p>

<span class="stage">[After defeating each aeon]</span><br />
<span class="M">Belgemine: Stop. That is enough.</span><br />
<span class="M">Belgemine: Ah, you have made some progress, and for that, I&#8217;m glad. Take this. It may come in handy. <span class="gift">~Various items</span></span></p>
<li class="choice">Perhaps later.</li>
<li class="reply"><span class="M">Belgemine: Hmm&#8230;I see.</span></li>

<span class="M">Belgemine: <span class="mov">(Chuckles)</span> That&#8217;s not possible. You have already surpassed your father. There is nothing more I can teach you. My work here on Spira is done. Time for me to go.</span><br />
<span class="G">Auron: Send her.</span><br />
<span class="tri">[If Yuna sends her&#8230;]</span><br />
<span class="Y">Yuna: Yes. <span class="mov">(Begins sending)</span> </span><br />

<p><span class="npc">Valefor in Besaid: Sin is cursed. Sin prays. It curses its form, it prays for dissolution. Sin sees dreams of its own destruction. Sin is looking at us. We live in a fading echo of time left us by the destroyer. Free him from Yu Yevon. Free him &#8212; the fayth that has become Sin.</p>
<p>Ifrit in Kilika: Sin swam in the sea near Zanarkand. Perhaps the waking dream eased its suffering. Your father touched Sin and became real that night, foundering in the seas of Spira. How sad now, that he is caught in the tragic spiral. He is Sin. He is lost.</p>
<p>Ixion in Djose: For a long time, we had forgotten how to go forward. You reminded us we must go forward. Yes, we must run. Let us go, you who share our dreaming. Come, and we will run till the dream&#8217;s end.</p>
<p>Shiva in Macalania: Should the dreaming end, you too will disappear&#8211;Fade into Spira&#8217;s sea, Spira&#8217;s sky. But do not weep, nor rise in anger. Even we were once human. That is why we must dream. Let us summon a sea in a new dream world. A new sea for you to swim.</p>
<p>Yojimbo in Cavern of the Stolen Fayth: You are a fading dream, but one touched by reality. Spira will not forget its reality, nor the one who saved it. Run, dream; run on. Pass beyond the waking, and walk into the daylight.</p>
<p>Magus Sisters (only one speaks): Why couldn&#8217;t we see to stop the dreaming? Why did we stay on in Spira? We had forgotten for so long. We had forgotten to move forward. We had forgotten to change.</span></p>

You can hone your battle skills here by fighting fiends gathered from all over Spira! But&#8230;the fiends all got away because I, uh, screwed up. I&#8217;m too old to gather fiends now, so I&#8217;m in quite a fix&#8230; So, that&#8217;s where you come in, sonny! Can I ask you to round up all the fiends for me? Of course, I&#8217;m not asking you to do it for free. There&#8217;ll be nice, fat rewards! On top of that, you can hone your fighting skills anytime against the fiends you bring back here! In addition, any items you win during training are yours to keep for free! But, there will be a small fee for each training session, so bear that in mind. How about it? Not a bad deal, eh?

<p><span class="sign">Village of the Cactuars<br />
&#8211;Using spheres to control the sands, the Cactuars defend their village. They are the Gatekeepers.<br />

<p><span class="stage">[Meeting first gatekeeper, you get instructions&#8230;]</span><br />
<span class="sign">Way of the Gatekeepers I: It may look like fun and games, but the Gatekeepers are a proud race of warriors. While they dislike combat, they will turn and face any enemy that takes their back.<br />
Way of the Gatekeepers II: Should you fail to sneak up on them they will realize they have over-estimated their enemy and depart in disgust.<br />
Way of the Gatekeepers III: Sneak up on the cactuars when their backs are turned to confront them. It&#8217;s better that way, believe me.</span></p>

Rovivea: Has no patience for certain dim-witted friends. Not a progressive thinker.<br />
Chava: Recently learned to count to 50. A little needy. Attention deficit.<br />
Alek &#038; Aloja: Two brothers, rarely separated. They move as one, their closeness a paragon of brotherhood.<br />
Vachella: Loves new things. Hard on others, easy on self. Stingy.<br />
Robeya: A real needle brain. Likes cramped spaces. Check out his great collection!<br />
Isrra:The philosopher about town. Today, he digs holes. Again. A cautious sort.<br />
Elio: To see what lies beyond the sands, he travels far to distant lands. Hyper-reactive and a bad poet.<br />

4 little gatekeepers play in the sand.  O, Robeya&#8217;s stuck inside.  Gone for good.<br />
3 little gatekeepers play in the sand.  A fiery inscription&#8211;The lord of the hole is gone, Isrra thinks.  Gone for good.<br />
