<h4 class="sc">Balcony Overlooking Luca</h4>
<p><span class="npc"><a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/oldmanblue.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/oldmanblue.jpg" target="screencap">Old man in blue pants</a>: I tried to stop the Crusaders, but I tell you, those youngsters won&#8217;t listen to anybody!<br />
&nbsp;&#172;I fear Sin will crush them and teach them just how futile repentance is then.</p>
<p><a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/manGB.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/manGB.jpg" target="screencap">Guy on bench</a> with dog and cat: Their owner&#8217;s a Crusader. I&#8217;m only looking after &#8217;em while the operation&#8217;s going on.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;I&#8217;d hate to see these fellas left on their own. I hope their owner returns safely.</p>
<p><a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/beclem.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/beclem.jpg" target="screencap">Crusader in red, white, blue</a>: Nothing you say will sway us. The Crusaders will proceed with the operation as planned.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;I am well aware of the risks of this mission. But we cannot simply run away.</p>
<p><a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/manWB.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/manWB.jpg" target="screencap">Man in white and blue</a>: The Crusaders are kicking up a real ruckus down the Highroad. This operation of theirs is getting out of hand.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Well, if they really can wipe out Sin, I guess it&#8217;s worth a little confusion.</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Luca Cafe</h4>
<p><span class="npc"><a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/womanP.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/womanP.jpg" target="screencap">Lady at the counter</a>: You&#8217;re a good player, but still need some work. If you want to get your hands on that thing, you&#8217;ll need to win more games.</p>
<p><span class="tri">After winning a tournament&#8230;</span><br />
Wow, you&#8217;ve become a great player! Now, as long as you bring it to me, I&#8217;ll present you with our heirloom.</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">Luca Square</h4>
<p><span class="npc"><a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/womanWB2.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/womanWB2.jpg" target="screencap">Mother</a> on bench: Most of the Crusaders that guard our city have gone off to that &#8220;operation.&#8221; Luca is defenseless! Whatever will we do if fiends appear?</p>
<p><a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/manYBG.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/manYBG.jpg" target="screencap">Father</a> (Jumal): The Crusaders may use machina in their operation. If so, they&#8217;re no different from the Al Bhed.</p>
<p><a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/calli.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/calli.jpg" target="screencap">Little girl</a> running around: You know what? They said that the Crusaders are bad people disobeying the teachings!</span></p>
<h4 class="sc">In Front of Stadium</h4>
<p><span class="npc">Righthand guard (<a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/guardbrown.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/guardbrown.jpg" target="screencap">Wedge</a>): It took forever to fix the stands inside the stadium.</p>
<p>Lefthand guard (<a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/guardblue.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/guardblue.jpg" target="screencap">Biggs</a>): Access is no longer restricted. Feel free to enter.<br />

<p><span class="npc"><a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/ronsoFB.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/ronsoFB.jpg" target="screencap">Blue-haired female Ronso</a>: Ronso warriors value their horns, and the people of Luca value blitzball.<br />
&nbsp;&#172; True believers of the teachings will not support the Crusaders.</p>
<p><a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/fabricmerchant.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/fabricmerchant.jpg" target="screencap">Man in purple coat</a>: Games are held every day, even after the tournament.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Maester Mika has already returned to Bevelle.</p>
<p><a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/manGP.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/manGP.jpg" target="screencap">Man in green and purple</a>: Those fiends really put a damper on the tournament.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;I was watching Maester Seymour&#8217;s aeon from here. It was awesome!</p>
<p><a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/ronsoFW.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/ronsoFW.jpg" target="screencap">White-haired female Ronso</a>: Many Ronso have left Luca to guard their sacred mountain, Gagazet.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Throughout the long history of Yevon, this is the first time a summoner has ever been appointed maester.</p>
<p><a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/guardgray.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/guardgray.jpg" target="screencap">Roving Luca guard in gray</a>: Even with the recent fiend scare, I can&#8217;t believe how crowded it is.<br />
&nbsp;&#172;It&#8217;s too bad the Aurochs&#8217; record losing streak had to end. That was the only thing going for them.</p>
<p>Lefthand <a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/guardbrown.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/guardbrown.jpg" target="screencap">guard</a> at railing: We no longer have the strength to fight&#8230;Should the fiends reappear, run for your lives!<br />
&nbsp;&#172;Thanks to the citizens&#8217; pitching in, the stadium has been repaired in no time.</p>
<p>Righthand <a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/guardbrown.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/guardbrown.jpg" target="screencap">guard</a> at railing: The fiends broke in, all because the Crusaders ditched guard duty this year. It&#8217;s all their fault! They should have been helping instead of devising some foolish plan!<br />
&nbsp;&#172;The Crusaders are dreamin&#8217;! Do they really think the operation will succeed?</span></p>

<p><a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/bickson.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/bickson.jpg" target="screencap">Bickson</a>: Our biggest mistake was going too easy on you Aurochs. We won&#8217;t hold back next time.</p>
<p><a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/graav.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/graav.jpg" target="screencap">Graav</a>: I consider your victory a total fluke.</p>
<p><a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/raudy.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/raudy.jpg" target="screencap">Raudy</a>: We&#8217;re just lending you the trophy until next year&#8217;s tournament. Keep it nice and shiny for us.</p>
<p><a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/balgerda.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/balgerda.jpg" target="screencap">Balgerda</a>: How could we lose to the Aurochs, of all teams? This is a disgrace!</p>
<p><a class="who sc-tooltip" data-image="../characters/doram.jpg" data-desc="" href="../characters/doram.jpg" target="screencap">Doram</a>: We didn&#8217;t lose to the Aurochs, we lost to Wakka&#8217;s spirit and dedication.</span></p>
<p><span class="tri">If the Aurochs lost&#8230;</span><br />
<span class="npc">Abus: Another tournament, another victory&#8230;But no parade, thanks to those fiends.</p>
<p>Bickson: We Luca Goers will always be on top. Crawl your way up if you think you can.</p>
<p>Graav: Just be grateful that your twenty-three-year losing streak is finally over.</p>
<p>Raudy: How can the Aurochs be runners-up? The competition these days just ain&#8217;t what it used to be.</p>
<p>Balgerda: Had enough? Come back when you&#8217;re a man.</p>

Eight centuries ago, he founded a legion known today as the Crusaders. In just a few short years after their founding, their ranks grew throughout Spira. The maesters of Yevon feared an uprising and accused them of rebellion. So Lord Mi&#8217;ihen walked along this very road to go face their charges and refute them. He succeeded in winning the maesters&#8217; trust, and his legion became an arm of the Yevon clergy. It was then that Yevon gave them the name &#8220;Crusaders,&#8221; which they have kept ever since. And the rest is history.<br />

<li class="choice">About the cannons.</li>
<li class="reply"><span class="npc">The Al Bhed provided us with these cannons at no charge. I hate the bastards, but I&#8217;ve got a little respect for them now. These cannons have good range. We&#8217;ll give Sin a shower it won&#8217;t soon forget!</span></li>
<li class="choice">About the Chocobo Knights.</li>
<li class="reply"><span class="npc">Only a select few can become Chocobo Knights. You have to be a skilled rider or achieve some combat merit to become one. Captain Lucil is no doubt the best of the bunch right now. I just don&#8217;t know how that wimp Clasko got knighted. Well, he is good at earning their trust&#8211;the chocobos, that is.</span></li>
<li class="choice">About this operation.</li>
<li class="reply"><span class="npc">We&#8217;ve researched Sin&#8217;s past behaviors in planning this operation. Sin often turns up where its sinspawn are. So we hunted down the sinspawn at various places and brought them here to lure it. When it shows up, we&#8217;re gonna hit it with the ancient machina, and it&#8217;s bye-bye Sin. The Crusaders&#8217; responsibility is to lure Sin and immobilize it. The Al Bhed will deliver the finishing blow. I wish it could be the other way around, but as long as we defeat Sin, who cares.</span></li>
