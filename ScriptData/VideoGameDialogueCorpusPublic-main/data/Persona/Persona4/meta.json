				"Ho ho! I'll lend you some of my fishin' gear, then.",
				"Let me tell you, fishin' is hard work. What you need is Diligence.",
				"You can still fish without Diligence, o'course, but you'll get pretty darn tired of it quick.",
				" ... Oh, well. Here's a Fishing Set. I'll give you ten of these here Baits, too.",
				"Fishin' in the day is fun, but night fishin' ...  That's just stylish.",
				"Do you want to hear some of my advice about fishin'? Hm?",
				"First, you toss in the float. If there's a fish around, he'll take a poke at it.",
				"If you rush it and pull your line up too fast, the fish'll get away. Well, you'll still have bait, so try again.",
				"Listen, you want to start pulling right after the float sinks. When it bites, reel it in by pulling continuously!",
				"If you don't keep pulling, it'll get away, and you'll lose your bait. Suck it up and pull as hard as you can!",
				"If you lack Diligence, you'll probably want to go home after just one try. A tough guy like me can fish five times!",
				"Oh, and your chances of landin' a real whopper are better on rainy days!",
				"Do whatever you want with the fish you catch. If you don't particularly want 'em, I'll trade good stuff for 'em.",
				"Good luck, boy.",
				" ... You know what I'm talkin' about, right? Samegawa has a Guardian in the river.",
				"I've only seen him once, when I was younger ... ",
				"I felt a tug I'd never felt before, and when I pulled ... ",
				"He was huge! Not only that, but there was this godly aura around him ... ",
				"I fought him for hours, but I lost 'im. No ...  I know he was just toying with me.",
				"I kept on fishin' for years and years, just hoping to catch a glimpse of him one more time, but ... ",
				"I'm an old man, and the strength is gone from these arms ...  Maybe it's time to hang up my rod for good.",
				" ... I just want to see him with my own two eyes one more time before I go to the big bait shop in the sky.",
				"Then, I wouldn't have any regrets ... ",
				"(sigh)",
				"Are there any skilled young fishermen out there ... ?",
				"That Huge Fish you got there ...  It's not bad ... ",
				" ... Will you listen to my final wish?",
				"Your skill, your eyes ...  I want to see you give it a try.",
				"I want you to land the Guardian! You can do it!",
				" ... Please! This old man's beggin' you!",
				"I see ... ! I see, I see!",
				"Alright, I'll give you this! My Angler's Set.",
				"I carved this rod by hand, with all my fishin' spirit. If anything can catch the Guardian, it's this.",
				" ... Oh, and try it on rainy days. It'll be harder for the fish to notice your presence when it's raining.",
				"And, this is my ultimate fishin' advice! Listen close, because I ain't gonna repeat myself.",
				"If you start pullin' when a fish pokes the bait, the fish'll run away, right?",
				"So ...  if you don't want to catch that fish, pull the bait away before it bites!",
				"You'll keep your bait, and the fish you don't want will swim away. Just keep repeating that ...  You get my drift?",
				"I'm counting on you!",
				"Ooooh!!",
				"Th-Th-That ...  That must be!",
				"(cough) (cough)",
				"(pant) (pant)",
				"(sigh) You scared me. I thought I was gonna die ... ",
				"So, that thing you've got there must be the Guardian ... ",
				"Congratulations, youngster!!",
				"I ...  I don't have any more regrets ...  Now I can live out the rest of my life in peace ... ",
				" ...  ... ",
