# Persona 4

In the source, the protoganist has been named "Souji" (Souji Seta). In related materials (e.g. the anime, manga) his name is "Yu Narukami" or "Soji Seta", but in the game, players can choose their own name for the character. 

## Gender Coding
Kunino Sagiri and Ameno Sagiri are referred to with neutral pronouns in the wiki, but their voice acting reads as male and they appear from (i.e. transform from) male characters, so I suspect players experience them accordingly. Left the coding as male, but could be revisited. 

Izanami is an interesting case. She spends much of the game in the guise of a gas station attendant, who appears quite androgynous, although late in the game, characters in the English subtitles refer to the attendant with male pronouns. However, in the English dub she's voiced by a woman (in both guises), whereas in Japanese there's a male voice actor for the gas station attendant (https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Izanami_(Persona_4). The face of the two doesn't seem to change. The wiki uses male pronouns throughout for the gas station attendant (https://megamitensei.fandom.com/wiki/Moel_Gas_Station_Attendant). I've left them as separate characters (Izanami and Attendant) and coded the latter tentatively as male (based on their character model and the in-game pronouns). This could be revisited. 

"Ema" are messages the fox gives you. They're unvoiced, and written by different people. Coded as neutral. 

I think * and Hollow Voice are Shadow Mitsuo and Mitsuo respectively, so have coded accordingly. Might need revisiting. 

"Postcard" written by Hisano's husband (and we're told as much in-game), so coded as male. 

"Soccer Player" is a generic - it seems to apply to various members of the team. They're all male, so coded accordingly. "Team Members" are soccer players. 

Naoto is a controversial example. Naoto is described with female pronouns in the fan wiki and in other sources, but dresses as a male and uses male pronouns to self-refer while cross-dressing. Some players have thus interpreted Naoto as a transman. One NPC speaks of Naoto as follows: "Naoto's that boyish ...  girlish ...  whatever, right? You know, she's, uh ...  pretty cute, hehehe." Others use male pronouns early on, and the game initially calls Naoto "Slender Young Man" in the English translation. However, Naoto's personal journey is framed as them coming to terms with their female gender identity against a backdrop of discrimination; Naoto states in-game: "I finally think I can accept myself. That I'm a woman…That I haven't yet become the detective I wanted to be… I… I am a woman… and a detective…". Given this, I've coded Naoto as female (deferring to her self-identification). However, this could be revisited.

"???" - Players are unsure about who this is, although there's some suspicion it's Izanami. It's unvoiced dialogue and given the lack of other clues I've coded as neutral.
