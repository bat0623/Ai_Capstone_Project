<i>Ever had one of those days? You know, the kind where you wonder what you did to someone in a past life? This was one of them, and it started even before I woke up. I had this weird-ass dream.</i><br/>

<i>I don't know what a blue limo driving through fog lined in blue velvet is supposed to mean, but I bet some shrink would get a damn paper out of coming up with something. Especially when I got to the people in there with me.</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>Normally I don't really remember dreams, but this one is clear as a bell.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Igor.png"/> My name is Igor… I am delighted to make your acquaintance.<br/>
This place exists between dream and reality, mind and matter…<br/>
It is a room that only those who are bound by a "contract" may enter…<br/>
It may be that such a fate awaits you in the near future.<br/>
Now then… Why don't you introduce yourself…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I wonder why I needed to tell my own creepy dream my name?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Igor.png"/> Hm… I see.<br/>
Now, let's take a look into your future, shall we?<br/>
Do you believe in fortune telling?<br/>
Each reading is done with the same cards, yet the result is always different…<br/>
*chuckle* Life itself follows the same principles, doesn't it?<br/>
Hm… The Tower in the upright position represents the immediate future. It seems a terrible catastrophe is imminent.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm moving a million miles away from home, I don't need a creepy dream troll to tell me catastrophe is coming. The next part, though, was a little more odd.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Igor.png"/> The Moon, in the upright position.<br/>
This card represents "hesitation" and "mystery"… Very interesting indeed.<br/>
It seems you will encounter a misfortune at your destination, and a great mystery will be imposed upon you.<br/>
In the coming days, you will enter into a contract of some sort, after which you will return here.<br/>
The coming year is a turning point in your destiny… If the mystery goes unsolved, your future may be forever lost.<br/>
My duty is to provide assistance to our guests to ensure that does not happen.<br/>
Ah! I have neglected to introduce my assistant to you.<br/>
This is Margaret. She is a resident of this place, like myself.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Igor.png"/> We shall attend to the details another time.<br/>
Until then, farewell…<br/>
<br/>
<i>That's when I woke up, which really made things even worse. As bad as crazy dreams might be, they were better than the reality of what was going to happen today. Moving to Inaba…</i><br/>

<i>There's been some story or another all over the news about some politician, Namatame or something, who's been stepping out on his wife with that news announcer Yamano. Nothing really interesting. Anyway my uncle had sent me a message saying he'd meet me at the station when I arrived.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I started kind of fuzzing out, seeing some strange things on the train. Luckily it got to Inaba before I started hallucinating or something.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> Welcome to Inaba. I'm Ryotaro Dojima. I'll be looking after you.<br/>
Let's see… I'm your mother's younger brother… and that about sums it up.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I hadn't seen my uncle in like forever.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> I'll say. You've really grown, I still remember when you were in diapers…<br/>
This here's my daughter.<br/>
Come on, Nanako, introduce yourself to your cousin.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'd not met my cousin Nanako at all, he's got some crazy job that takes up all his time and stops him coming to visit.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> …'lo.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> *chuckle * What're you so shy for?<br/>
Ow, hahaha.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> Well then… Let's get going.<br/>
My car's over there.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was a bit of a drive back into town, and we ended up stopping for gas.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00085.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00086.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> Can you go to the bathroom by yourself?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> Uh-huh.<br/>
<b>Attendant:</b> It's in the back, to your left. You know which way's left? The side you don't hold your chopsticks in.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> I know… Geez…<br/>
<b>Attendant:</b> Are you taking a trip?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> No, we just went to pick him up. He just moved here from the big city.<br/>
<b>Attendant:</b> The city, huh…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> Fill up my car while you're at it. Regular's fine.<br/>
<b>Attendant:</b> Right away, Sir!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> Good a time as any for a smoke…<br/>
<br/>
<i>The attendant struck up a conversation with me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Attendant:</b> Does it surprise a city boy to see how little there is out here?<br/>
There's so little to do, I'm sure you'll get bored fast. You'll either be hanging out with your friends or doing part-time jobs.<br/>
Speaking of which, we're actually looking for part-time help right now.<br/>
Give it some thought, why don't you? We don't mind if you're a student.<br/>
Oh, I should get back to work.<br/>
&gt; Nanako is looking at you.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I started feeling kind of queasy. I guess it was the trip.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00107.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> Did you get carsick?<br/>
You don't look too good…<br/>
&gt;Could it be exhaustion from the long trip…? Now that she mentions it, you feel a little dizzy…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dojima got back from his smoke, and we finished our drive.</i><br/>

<br/>
&gt; For the next year, this place will be your home…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We sat down and had some dinner.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00115.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> So… Your mom and dad are busy as always… They're working overseas, was it?<br/>
I know it's only for a year, but getting stuck in a place like this because of your parents… It's rough being a kid.<br/>
Well, it's just me and Nanako here, so it'll be nice having someone you around.<br/>
So long as you're here, you're part of the family, so make yourself at home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>If I was going to be stuck here, at least it would be with nice people.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00120.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> C'mon, there's no need to be so formal.<br/>
Look, you're making Nanako all tense.<br/>
Well, anyway… Let's eat.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Before we could start, Dojima got a call.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00124.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> …Dojima speaking.<br/>
……<br/>
Yeah? I see… So where is it?<br/>
……<br/>
All right, I'm on my way.<br/>
Looks like I made the right choice to skip the booze…<br/>
Sorry, but I gotta go take care of some business. Go ahead and eat without me.<br/>
I don't know how late I'll be. Nanako, you help him out, okay?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> …Okay.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00134.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> I already brought it in!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> …All right. Well, I'm off.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dojima left, and Nanako turned the TV on.</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>Weather Announcer:</b> With storm clouds moving in from the west, expect rain throughout the day tomorrow in most areas.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> …Let's eat.<br/>
&gt; You find yourself alone with Nanako…<br/>
&gt; You might want to strike up a conversation…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> He… investigates stuff. Like crime scenes.<br/>
My dad's a detective.<br/>
<b>Announcer:</b> And now for the local news.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Crap, not this again. Why do people get so obsessed with these things?</i><br/>

<b>Announcer:</b> In response, Eye Television has decided to cancel all of announcer Mayumi Yamano's televised appearances.<br/>

<i>Those things have been sprouting up like mushrooms all over the place. But out here, I guess it's your best bet for shopping. Nanako seems to like the place.</i><br/>
