			<b>7/24/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>Yosuke was off today, so we headed to the Samegawa.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You wandered here with a pensive Yosuke…<br/>
&gt; Yosuke is holding something…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> …I found this. It's a Print Club sticker I took with Saki-senpai…<br/>
When I first got here, she insisted on taking it…<br/>
Back then… somewhere inside me, I thought I was above this place…<br/>
A lot of people saw me as the enemy, because Junes was going to ruin the shopping district…<br/>
But… when I met her, she told me, "Parents are parents. You're you…"<br/>
Even if she didn't really mean it… it made me happy.<br/>
Because of her… I started to think maybe this town wasn't all that bad.<br/>
But then…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's a shame Yosuke will never really have his answers.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Why…?<br/>
Why did she… have to… die…?<br/>
It pisses me off… It makes me mad!<br/>
I wanted to talk with her more! I wanted to get to know her better!<br/>
But…<br/>
She's… not here anymore.<br/>
&gt; Yosuke is sobbing out loud…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Souji… I get it now…<br/>
I wanted to forget about Saki-senpai. How's she not here anymore…<br/>
I wanted to forget that… I was living a boring life in the middle of nowhere.<br/>
When the murders started, I got excited…<br/>
I thought there was finally a point to me being in Inaba…<br/>
I thought I could forget Senpai was gone… and the fact that I was such a loser…<br/>
I jumped at the murders and never once thought about what I was doing…<br/>
I… didn't even take the first step…<br/>
I'm sorry… Saki-senpai. I'm sorry… Souji.<br/>
<br/>
<i>If he understands, though, he can try to do something about it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> But… I got you involved with the case, and all I did was run away from myself…<br/>
&gt; Yosuke is looking at you, his eyes red…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> But I think I'm awake now…<br/>
I need to get over the fact that Saki-senpai isn't coming back…<br/>
That when this case ends… I'll have nowhere to run…<br/>
And I won't have changed…<br/>
……<br/>
…You made me realize that.<br/>
&gt; It seems you were able to act as Yosuke's crutch…<br/>
&gt; You feel a bond between you and Yosuke…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Despite what he says, I think Yosuke's changed a lot.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Souji… I think I'm all cried out…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided to mess with him a little.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Haha… Quit treating me like a kid…<br/>
&gt; Yosuke is smiling through his tears…<br/>
&gt; You stayed by Yosuke's side, then walked him home…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nanako seems to want to say something, but I can't quite get her to tell me. I'll ask again some other time.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>7/25/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>It rained again, though sadly not all day.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Yukiko.png"/> Hey, have you seen the weather report?<br/>
This rain's going to lift in the afternoon, but they said it's going to rain all day tomorrow.<br/>
Wouldn't it be a good idea to check the Midnight Channel… just in case?<br/>
The culprit is already wanted by the police, but he's someone the police can't handle to begin with.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Souji.png"/> Let's check it out.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Yukiko.png"/> Yes.<br/>
Let's let everyone else know too, okay?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Exam results were in, I was pretty happy with the outcome.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> They posted the test results!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Argh… The awful moment of truth…<br/>
Oh well. Wanna check it out?<br/>
&gt; You decided to check the test results.<br/>
&gt; You got the highest score!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Whoooa! You're a genius, Souji!<br/>
That's awesome! I'm just as happy as if I'd got the highest grade myself!<br/>
&gt; Lunch break is almost over. You decided to return to class…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh, and Ms. Sofue had checked the grades too.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Ms. Sofue:</b> It is through diligent study that we are bonded with ages past… Ahaha… Keep up the good work.<br/>
Now, a little something for you.<br/>
&gt; Obtained Magic Mirror x 3.<br/>
<b>Ms. Sofue:</b> You know, for as long as time's wheel has turned, hard work has reaped its rewards. Ahaha…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I hadn't heard much from Yumi recently, I decided to head to the hospital to see how things were.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00083.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You hear Yumi's voice coming from inside…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yumi.png"/> Here, open your mouth…<br/>
Oh, it fell out…<br/>
…I didn't peel it. This fruit came from a can.<br/>
You want me to cut it into smaller pieces? …Are you sure?<br/>
…Then I'll go throw this away.<br/>
<br/>
<i>This was about where she came out into the hall.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yumi.png"/> You came here because you were worried about me?<br/>
……<br/>
When I come to see him… he wakes up.<br/>
He should be in a lot of pain, but he won't take his medicine, because he says it puts him to sleep…<br/>
He says… because he doesn't have much longer… he wants to say awake as long as he can… So he can see Mom and me…<br/>
…He's so stupid.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Souji.png"/> He's a kind father.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yumi.png"/> I forgot about him all this time… No, I just didn't want to remember…<br/>
That he actually was a kind man. He played with me so much when I was a child…<br/>
&gt; Yumi smiles, lost in memory.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yumi.png"/> He waits all my life to show up all of a sudden and turn my life around… And then he's going to leave again…<br/>
It's not fair…<br/>
Souji-kun… Thank you for coming…<br/>
I'm… I'm scared…<br/>
I'm scared to be alone… in that room, listening to him breathing…<br/>
It's so quiet… I don't know when he's just going to stop breathing, forever.<br/>
……<br/>
<br/>
<i>Poor Yumi.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00108.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yumi.png"/> I… I don't know what to do, but I don't want to have any regrets later.<br/>
So I'll do what I can now…<br/>
&gt; It seems you were able to give Yumi some support…<br/>
&gt; You feel that your relationship with Yumi has deepened…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I can't imagine what it would be like to have a family member dying like this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00113.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yumi.png"/> Oh… Visiting hours are almost over. I'm going to stay here.<br/>
…I'll see you at school.<br/>
&gt; Yumi walked off, looking helpless. You went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh, and Nanako had made something for me while she was at school.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00118.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> Dad said you got the best score in the school on your tests.<br/>
That's incredible!<br/>
Umm… I made this.<br/>
H-Here you go.<br/>
&gt; Nanako gave you Paper Armband.<br/>
*giggle *<br/>
<br/>
<i>I somehow feel tougher just wearing it.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>Also how the hell did Dojima already know? Scary guy sometimes.</i><br/>

<b>Guy With A Backpack:</b> Summer vacation starts TOMORROW! Woohoo!<br/>
<b>Bespectacled Student:</b> Too bad it's raining. The forecast said that it was going to last until evening…<br/>
Well, it'll let up by tomorrow morning. I wonder if we'll have a nice, clear summer sky tomorrow.<br/>
<b>Guy With A Backpack:</b> Oh, well… It's not like I had any plans or anything.<br/>
I guess I could watch "Tanaka's Amazing Commodities" and see if there's anything I want.<br/>
I don't know what it is about that show, but I always end up buying something.<br/>
It's that one that goes: "Over the airwaves to yoooouuuu!" Have you seen it…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Time passed so damn slowly.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00134.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kashiwagi.png"/> I won't say anything mean like SOMEONE I know, but please do what you're told.<br/>
*giggle * I'm excited about summer vacation too! I already bought my swimsuit.<br/>
Not that it's got that much material to call it a swimsuit… Hmhmhm.<br/>
Well, enjoy your summer vacation, everyone. Oh, and don't forget to do your homework, okay?<br/>
<br/>
<i>God she's disgusting. I decided to check in on Yumi one last time, I'm sure she'll be very busy in the summer with her father so sick. After that I headed home. It was raining at night once again…</i><br/>

<br/>
&gt; Something may appear on TV…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Not only did something appear on TV, but it was immediately clear.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00149.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It's an extremely vivid image!<br/>
&gt; A boy is standing with his back against a wall…<br/>
<br/>
<i>He was familiar, though I can't place from where.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00152.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Mitsuou.png"/> You all think you can see me? You all think you know everything about me?<br/>
……<br/>
Then try and catch me.<br/>
&gt; Who was that…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, did you see that!?<br/>
Who was that guy? I don't know him… Have you ever seen him on the news or some television special?<br/>
He seemed really gloomy… Like a zombie…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Teddie2.png"/> Yosuke! Yooosukeeee!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Alright already, I hear you! Sorry, I'm gonna give the phone to Ted.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Teddie had some interesting thoughts on the Midnight Channel now that he'd finally seen it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00162.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Teddie2.png"/> I finally got to see the Midnight Channel with my own eyes. Now I know exactly what's happening.<br/>
That guy's suppressed emotions are resonating with the other side, which are picked up by the TVs over here.<br/>
It's clear now that it's not being filmed by anyone. Mystery solved!<br/>
But that kid… He must already be inside the other world!<br/>
What're we gonna do!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Souji.png"/> We're going in.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Teddie2.png"/> Gotcha! I knew I could count on you, Sensei!<br/>
&gt; You can sense Teddie's strong trust in you…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Teddie2.png"/> I think my heart skipped a beat…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nothing I hadn't already guessed, but it's good to know.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00172.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> That's enough, Ted! Gimme the phone!<br/>
Hey, how could he be already inside!? What happened to the blurry image that we usually see in advance?<br/>
And did you hear what he said?<br/>
"Try and catch me"…<br/>
……<br/>
Now that I think about it, he looked like a high schooler… Hey, could he be…?<br/>
Nah, I better not jump to conclusions. Let's meet up at headquarters tomorrow. Alright, later!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I didn't need Yosuke to finish that statement. Chie called right after that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00185.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Chie.png"/> Oh, I finally got through! Yosuke's line was busy, too…<br/>
I was just talking to Yukiko! Was that…?<br/>
&gt; You recapped your conversation with Yosuke and Teddie for her.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Chie.png"/> Yeah, we gotta get to the bottom of this. Well, off to bed. G'night.<br/>
&gt; …You decided to go to bed early.<br/>
<br/>
<i>None of us wanted to jump to conclusions, but I think we all understood: That was the killer.</i><br/>
