<i>Well, at least Yukiko's not angry at me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The boxed lunch Yukiko brought looks delicious…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> Don't worry, it's good!<br/>
&gt; It looks pretty good…<br/>
&gt; You decided to close your eyes and shove it into your mouth.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; It's…<br/>
&gt; …delicious!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> Is it good? Really?<br/>
Thank goodness… Er, well of course it is…<br/>
Half the cooking was done by the head chef… He took over again.<br/>
But he told me it's gotten a lot better!<br/>
I'm also thinking of continuing my studies for a job license.<br/>
I don't plan to leave anymore, but I thought I might as well.<br/>
I'm glad I realized sooner…<br/>
If I'd struck out on my own, I know I would have regretted it.<br/>
I wanted to become completely self-sufficient.<br/>
But I think I was being presumptuous.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukiko had realized what she would be leaving if she moved away.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> I am who I am now because I was raised by such a kind group…<br/>
When I think of it that way, my problems aren't just my own.<br/>
That's why… I'm going to say here. By my own will.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> That's good.<br/>
<br/>
<i>And just like Yosuke, she found a new power through this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Her Persona became Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Konohana Sakuya has transfigured into Amaterasu!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> This is… my new power…?<br/>
The power you've shown to me…<br/>
…Power I will treasure.<br/>
I want you to have this.<br/>
&gt; You obtained Shrine Charm.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> It's a charm from that shrine… To protect you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> Thank you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> …Mm.<br/>
&gt; Yukiko is smiling gently…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> I think of you as an irreplaceable friend.<br/>
No matter how far apart we are, even if we never meet again, that feeling will never change.<br/>
You're dear to me.<br/>
&gt; You can feel Yukiko's pure, simple emotion…<br/>
&gt; You feel a strong bond between you and Yukiko…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I still wonder a bit about what might have happened if I wasn't so dumb earlier but I guess things can only go one way in a lifetime.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I also got the power to create a persona called Scathach, who was the mentor of a hero named Cu Chulain.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> I've never known any boys who I could call close friends. I'm very happy…<br/>
Let's talk, shall we?<br/>
&gt; You spent a long while talking with Yukiko while eating her boxed lunch…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still, what does it mean that we're still getting stronger? Is there still some use for our power, something we haven't seen yet?</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>8/23/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>That poor Namatame guy. Since Mayumi Yamano died he's been moping around town.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Namatame.png"/> Even though I've earned more than enough…<br/>
…Why did that have to happen…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Me and Chie were going to Aiya later, but before we could enter we heard something from the alley behind.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You finished today's training and decided to stop by with Chie…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Chie.png"/> Steak bowl or a combo plate… The ultimate decision…<br/>
<b>Familiar Voice:</b> S-Stop it…!<br/>
<b>Threatening Voice:</b> Shut up, dumbass.<br/>
<b>Young Man's Voice:</b> Yeah, that's right. We all know it's time to cough up.<br/>
What? This's it? Quit bullshitting us.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Chie.png"/> Th-That voice… It can't be…!<br/>
Let's go, Souji-kun!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie's asshole friend Takeshi was getting hassled by some thugs.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Punk:</b> Hey, someone's here.<br/>
<b>Punk Leader:</b> Whatever. Let's take their money while we're at it.<br/>
<b>Punk:</b> This guy only had 1,000 yen on him.<br/>
<b>Takeshi:</b> Ch-Chie!<br/>
<b>Punk:</b> Hey!<br/>
<b>Punk Leader:</b> Whaddaya runnin' for? Gonna hide behind a girl, huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Chie.png"/> Are you all right?<br/>
<b>Takeshi:</b> I-I'm fine…<br/>
Y-You've always been good at stuff like this!<br/>
Th-They took all my money. You're gonna get them for me, right!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Chie.png"/> Well, it does tick me off!!<br/>
Hey, cowards! Ganging up on one guy… You oughtta be ashamed!<br/>
<b>Takeshi:</b> T-Take care of them for me!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Chie.png"/> Uh, wow, that was fast!<br/>
…Sheesh!<br/>
C'mon, what's the matter? Let's throw down!<br/>
<b>Punk Leader:</b> Huh? What's with this bitch?<br/>
Y'think you're all that? I ain't afraid to hit a girl… We'll kick your ass!<br/>
&gt; The punks are aggravated by Chie's taunt…<br/>
&gt; Things aren't looking good…<br/>
<br/>
<i>For these guys' own sake I decided to take matters into my own hands. I mean even these punks don't need to have their balls kicked into their necks.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Chie.png"/> Huh…? Souji-kun?<br/>
&gt; Chie seems discontent…<br/>
<b>Punk Leader:</b> What a pain in the ass…<br/>
<b>Punk:</b> Yo, that guy who ran away might call the cops.<br/>
<b>Punk Leader:</b> Screw this. Let's go.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Chie.png"/> Hey, hold on! Wait!!<br/>
……<br/>
What the heck…<br/>
Running away when you step in.<br/>
……<br/>
…Why'd you butt in?<br/>
What, you thought you couldn't leave it up to me!? I could've handled them myself!<br/>
…Sorry.<br/>
I charged in by myself… Caused you trouble…<br/>
<br/>
<i>She may jump into things but Chie's heart is always in the right place.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00106.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Chie.png"/> …Thanks.<br/>
&gt; Chie looks apologetic…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Chie.png"/> You're right, huh? I gotta remember I'm not alone…<br/>
It's always like that. Everyone's doing their best…<br/>
Then I start to worry that it's all up to me… and I've gotta work harder…<br/>
I worry that someday, I'll end up causing even more trouble, like I did today…<br/>
Haha… I'm so stupid.<br/>
&gt; It seems Chie regrets her grandstanding…<br/>
&gt; You felt Chie's quiet passion…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie wouldn't be Chie if she wasn't eating steak and charging into danger.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00116.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Chie.png"/> Souji-kun… Thank you.<br/>
Umm…<br/>
……<br/>
N-Never mind!<br/>
……<br/>
I need to work harder, huh? Why am I moping…?<br/>
I'll think about it some.<br/>
…Though I'm not too smart!<br/>
&gt; You walked home partway with Chie.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh, and Nanako's got some summer homework to do, so I helped her with some of it earlier.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00130.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; According to her, there's a huge pile of homework…<br/>
&gt; The objective of Nanako's homework is to tighten the bond between family members by doing homework together.<br/>
&gt; …It's too much for Nanako to finish all by herself.<br/>
&gt; Should you help Nanako with her homework for the next few nights?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> Really!?<br/>
Thank you, big bro!<br/>
Umm… Then I'll start working on spelling practice.<br/>
&gt; Nanako is doing her best to practice her spelling…<br/>
&gt; She seems to be doing well… But you decided to double-check her work anyway.<br/>
&gt; After Nanako finished her spelling, you put her to bed and returned to your room.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I feel like I'm forgetting something. I'm sure I'll figure it out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>8/24/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ugh, I've got homework too.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; From Nanako's homework last night…<br/>
&gt; You remember that you had homework as well…<br/>
&gt; However, it would only take you a few days to do it.<br/>
&gt; But, you promised Nanako that you would help her with her homework every night.<br/>
&gt; Maybe you can do your homework during the daytime…<br/>
&gt; You can start on your homework today…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was such a nice day, though, that I didn't get started. Instead I headed to the shopping district, Kanji was chilling out near the textile shop and we hung out for a while.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00150.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You came to Tatsumi Textiles…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Gotta warn you-there's nothin' fun here.<br/>
Hey Ma, I'm home…<br/>
……?<br/>
She ain't here. What's she doin' leaving the store open…?<br/>
<b>Aiya Owner:</b> Kan-chan! There you are!<br/>
Your mother's in the hospital!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> The hospital…?<br/>
……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> Let's hurry.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Huh…?<br/>
Oh, y-yeah… I need to go… and see…<br/>
<b>Aiya Owner:</b> I only heard from a customer, but she's at Inaba Municipal Hospital!<br/>
Hurry, go!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Y-Yessir!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We rushed to the hospital, but it turned out things weren't quite what we thought.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00167.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> You all right!? You were taken to the hospital!? Someone did this to you…!?<br/>
<b>Kanji's Mother:</b> Goodness, but you look pale.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Never mind me!! What about you…!?<br/>
…Huh?<br/>
You're okay?<br/>
<b>Kanji's Mother:</b> I wasn't taken to the hospital. I took someone.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Huh…?<br/>
<b>Kanji's Mother:</b> The poor thing got hit by a bicycle right in front of our shop.<br/>
He hit his head, so I had a doctor examine him.<br/>
He said there's no damage, thank goodness.<br/>
The one who hit him was a boy from your school. When he saw the poor child fall, he ran away.<br/>
Why don't you find him and give him a little scolding?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Cut the crap!<br/>
You've got no idea how I felt!<br/>
<b>Kanji's Mother:</b> Haha, I'm fine.<br/>
Your mother isn't kicking the bucket that easily. It's not like you to get so worried over such a little thing.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Shut up, you old cow!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>He ran off, and I followed after him.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00186.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Sorry. Looks like it was no big deal…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> That's good.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Well, yeah, but…<br/>
&gt; Kanji still looks embarrassed…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> I thought I faced alla my bad parts back there…<br/>
But not everything can change just like that, huh…?<br/>
Oh, uh… Sorry for draggin' you around.<br/>
If I'd been by myself, I mighta been even more scared… Hah.<br/>
Hope I can repay the favor.<br/>
&gt; It seems you were able to support Kanji…<br/>
&gt; You sense his trust in you…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm just glad his mother's okay.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00198.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> …I'm goin' home.<br/>
<b>Kanji's Mother:</b> That boy…<br/>
We were both going home… He didn't have to run away like that.<br/>
Oh… You're Souji-kun? You came to our store with Yuki-chan, right?<br/>
I've been hearing a lot about you from Kanji.<br/>
"Senpai this" and "Senpai that"… He must really like you.<br/>
I'm sorry to have made you both come all the way here. He hates hospitals, you see…<br/>
His father… my husband died here.<br/>
Kanji happened to be somewhere else when he collapsed…<br/>
So I think he was scared today.<br/>
Haha, but it's good to see you.<br/>
He's always had trouble getting along with people. He didn't have any friends like you before.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I took a stab in the dark based on what his Shadow had said.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00215.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Kanji's Mother:</b> Oh, he told you?<br/>
He would always rather play house instead of catch, or go to home ec instead of P.E.<br/>
So he never had any male friends, but the girls didn't accept him either.<br/>
After a while, he started getting into fights every day and bleaching his hair…<br/>
I was worried about him… But lately, he seems to be having fun.<br/>
Please take care of him.<br/>
&gt; You feel you understand Kanji a bit more…<br/>
&gt; You parted with Kanji's mother and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nanako still had a lot of homework, but she got some extra help this time.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00224.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> I have to write three proverbs for my homework today.<br/>
Oh, I know one! It's, um… "A rolling stone gathers no moss."<br/>
Dad always tells me that one.<br/>
Who can that be?<br/>
&gt; Yosuke and Teddie came by.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yosuke.png"/> We had a little event going on at Junes today. Here's a souvenir for you, Nanako-chan!<br/>
…Oh, are you doing your summer homework? I feel sorry for you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Teddie2.png"/> Alright! I'll help you, Nana-chan!<br/>
Um… Proverbs… Ooh… Uh…<br/>
Oh, I have one. "Cogito ergo sum"!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yosuke.png"/> Where did you pick that up…? "Don't cast pearls before swine" is more like something you'd say.<br/>
&gt; Yosuke and Teddie helped Nanako finish her homework.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was pretty surprised Teddie knew that one too. Where could he have heard it?</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>8/25/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>It was raining today, so I stayed in to do some of the summer homework. Not quite done yet, though. Nanako had an essay to write, and we had some more help once again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00245.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> I have to write an essay about something I remember.<br/>
Hmm…<br/>
Is someone here today too?<br/>
&gt; Chie and Yukiko came by.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Chie.png"/> I heard from Yosuke that Nanako-chan is doing her homework, so I'm here to help you.<br/>
You're writing an essay? Have you decided on a topic, Nanako-chan?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> Not yet?<br/>
Hmm, let' see… How about the time when we went to the festival together?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> That's right! The ikayaki was sooo good, and I had so much fun!<br/>
&gt; Nanako begins writing her essay…<br/>
&gt; Chie and Yukiko helped Nanako with her essay.<br/>
&gt; After putting Nanako to bed and saying goodbye to Chie and Yukiko, you went to your room.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still a few more days of Nanako's homework to do, and about the same amount of my own. Oh well, just gotta get it done.</i>
