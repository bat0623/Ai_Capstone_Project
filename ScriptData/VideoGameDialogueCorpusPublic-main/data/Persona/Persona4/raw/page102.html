<br/>
&gt; Together with them, you have overcome many ordeals, and the peace you've long waited for has returned…<br/>
&gt; Though the extreme cold has eased somewhat, the winter weather in this region is still severe.<br/>
&gt; But the days that you spend with your friends whom you have faced the truth with are always warm.<br/>
&gt; And…<br/>
&gt; Time has passed… and spring has come.<br/>
&gt; It's the day before you must go back to the city…<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>3/20/12</b><br/><br/>
<i>I suppose I was sort of bothered even before the day really began. After all, this was my last day in Inaba. But I never would have imagined it all ending this way.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Dojima.png"/> All done packing? Well… if you forget anything, I'll mail it to you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Nanako.png"/> Can I go answer the door?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Dojima.png"/> Oh yeah… That's right.<br/>
Sure, go answer it. There's nothing to worry about anymore.<br/>
Seeing her so cheerful like that… Nothing makes me happier.<br/>
I already bought your train ticket for tomorrow. It leaves at nine o'clock in the morning from Yasoinaba Station.<br/>
Today's your last day here… Don't worry about Nanako. You can leave her to me.<br/>
Go see your friends. This might be your last chance to talk to them.<br/>
&gt; This is the last day you will be spending in this town.<br/>
&gt; You should wander around for a while…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Nanako.png"/> Are you going out? Be careful!<br/>
<br/>
<i>The letter was for me, though I didn't really look at it. I just carried it along with me. Anyway, I started out down by the Samegawa. There was a big surprise waiting for me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Hisano.png"/> My, my! What a coincidence. We really are connected by fate. *chuckle *<br/>
Shall we talk like old times?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Souji.png"/> Sure.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Hisano.png"/> Goodness, I'm so happy.<br/>
I just went to visit my husband's grave. Then I came to look at the river like I did last time…<br/>
Next thing I know, here you are. There's a surprise.<br/>
I live with one of my kids, and his family now. They're all so kind.<br/>
…I just realized that I almost never talked about my kids with you.<br/>
I probably distanced myself from the rest of my family…<br/>
I was afraid that if I didn't, I was going to depend on them…<br/>
……<br/>
They're living their own lives; I didn't want to be a burden on them.<br/>
So I wanted them to forget about me… to treat me as if I was dead.<br/>
But they welcomed me… and now we live together.<br/>
They take care of me, but I'm taking care of my grandson.<br/>
*chuckle * So there's a little bit of give-and-take there.<br/>
There really is a place in the world where I belong.<br/>
I'd just assumed that there wasn't one.<br/>
They're my children… my family. I regret that I didn't talk with them before.<br/>
My husband's death must have been sad for them, too. After all, they lost their father…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm glad she was able to find her family again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Hisano.png"/> Yes, very much so…<br/>
I'm so happy right now, but because of that, I feel sad every now and then.<br/>
I can't help but think, "He must have wanted to feel this happiness, too…"<br/>
So I've decided that the best thing I can do is live a long, happy life.<br/>
I'll make the rest of my life as great as it can be… And then I'll tell my husband about it when I see him again.<br/>
Then, we'll have all of eternity to be happy together.<br/>
I'm not afraid anymore. Just… a little lonely.<br/>
*chuckle * I'll also have to tell him everything that happened in town, too.<br/>
About this whole crazy year, those awful murders, and how the police solved the case.<br/>
I'll definitely have to tell him all about you, too.<br/>
……<br/>
I recently realized something.<br/>
Precious things remain precious, whether you're alive or dead…<br/>
Sorry for making you listen to my long-winded monologue.<br/>
You look like you still have things left to do.<br/>
You look like you've grown up a lot, Souji-chan. You're much more handsome now, too.<br/>
Not as handsome as my husband was, though. *chuckle *<br/>
Well then… Take care of yourself.<br/>
You still have a lot of life ahead of you.<br/>
&gt; You feel a close bond between Hisano and yourself…<br/>
&gt; HIsano left without looking back…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I remembered there was an early bus to the hospital so I decided to see if Sayoko was there today. I was pretty surprised by what I found.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Young Nurse:</b> Have you heard about Uehara-san?<br/>
&gt; They seem to be talking about Sayoko…<br/>
<b>Young Nurse:</b> She joined some volunteer organization and went to Africa.<br/>
<b>Slim Nurse:</b> Africa!? I never though she'd be he kind of person who would go there…<br/>
<b>Young Nurse:</b> Well, she seemed to be taking her job very seriously towards the end of her time here. She even studied during break.<br/>
Do you remember when we were talking about the rumors of the Midnight Channel? She wasn't interested at all.<br/>
<b>Slim Nurse:</b> Oh, I remember those rumors. Not that I know where they started…<br/>
But yeah, not that you mention it, Uehara-san was never around when we were chatting about them.<br/>
She was studying some foreign language, wasn't she?<br/>
<b>Young Nurse:</b> She was trying to learn English and some African languages. She read a lot of medical books, too.<br/>
<b>Slim Nurse:</b> I see… But, why Africa? Why'd she join a volunteer organization? What's the point?<br/>
I'd rather marry a guy, raise kids, and be an ordinary housewife.<br/>
<b>Young Nurse:</b> That's what I used to think too, but watching Uehara-san kinda made me feel different about it.<br/>
…She did seem to have a boyfriend, though. A very young one, too!<br/>
<b>Slim Nurse:</b> Oh, it must have been that kid who was working here part-time…<br/>
<b>Young Nurse:</b> I don't know the details, but he seemed to really mean something to her…<br/>
She one told me that she was trying to do her best to live up to him…<br/>
<b>Slim Nurse:</b> "Do her best," eh…?<br/>
…I feel I have to try harder, too…<br/>
<b>Young Nurse:</b> Yeah… I'm starting to see where she was coming from.<br/>
…Let's get back to work and do our best.<br/>
&gt; It seems that Sayoko is working hard in a foreign country…<br/>
&gt; Even though Sayoko is gone, her life here has changed people for the better.<br/>
&gt; You feel a close bond between Sayoko and yourself…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Even though I might never see her again, I could feel how much we meant to each other. Anyway, I caught a bus down to the Amagi Inn from there, Yukiko had to work for a while today.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00096.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Yukiko.png"/> Souji-kun… That's right, you're leaving tomorrow.<br/>
Thanks for coming to see me before you leave…<br/>
…It means a lot to me.<br/>
I… I was thinking of spending today as just another day.<br/>
Helping with the housework, taking a long bath, and going to sleep…<br/>
 So I can… I can say goodbye without crying…<br/>
*chuckle * But I failed miserably… I kept thinking about you…<br/>
And on top of that… Here you are, right in front of me. You're not helping at all.<br/>
…You're so mean.<br/>
That's it, I'm leaving town with you tomorrow!<br/>
*chuckle * Just kidding… for now.<br/>
You know… After I decided to stay here and become the manager, I realized how afraid I was…<br/>
Whether I can meet all the responsibilities…<br/>
Whether I'll be able to support the whole staff on my own…<br/>
I never thought of things like that…<br/>
But I've made my decision… Now I have to make an honest attempt at it.<br/>
I'll do my best to overcome the fear.<br/>
And you'll be in my heart while I do, Souji-kun…<br/>
We'll be together… even when we're apart.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was happy that Yukiko was happy with her decision to stay.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00116.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Yukiko.png"/> I'm going to meet every challenge head-on, no matter how hard it seems…<br/>
…Remember what Ameno-sagiri said? "If mankind so wishes, I will return at any time…"<br/>
That's not what I wish for…<br/>
I'll face myself, no matter what happens.<br/>
Souji-kun… Thank you.<br/>
You'll forever be my precious friend.<br/>
&gt; You feel a solid bond between you and Yukiko…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Yukiko.png"/> U-Um, well… I-I should get back to work!<br/>
I'll see you tomorrow…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was already starting to notice something strange, but it hadn't quite started to bother me yet. Anyway, back in the shopping district I ran into Chie. Improbably, she was at the bookstore.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00126.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> You caught me off guard, haha…<br/>
Oh, umm… I was just thinking of you, and you suddenly showed up, so…<br/>
&gt; Chie is laughing, embarrassed…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> …Tomorrow's the day, huh?<br/>
I thought a lot about you, and I… I decided to come here.<br/>
I was thinking, "What can I do for you?" And I figured crying or feeling sad about you leaving wasn't it…<br/>
So I made up my mind… I'm gonna show you what you've taught me.<br/>
I bought a book.<br/>
It's called… "How to Become a Police Officer!"<br/>
I told you I wanted to become strong so I could protect what matters most to me, right?<br/>
Well, I want to protect this town.<br/>
We all worked hard to win this peace… I wanna keep it this way.<br/>
You can't be certain that no incident like this will ever happen again, right?<br/>
……<br/>
This is where all my best friends are… It's where I met you.<br/>
…So I thought maybe I'd become a cop, and have Dojima-san put me through the wringer!<br/>
&gt; Chie is smiling cheerfully…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> So go home proud. We'll be fine here…<br/>
……<br/>
Come back anytime. We'll all be waiting for you.<br/>
&gt; You feel a tight bond with Chie…<br/>
…You still have to say goodbye to everyone else, right?<br/>
Go ahead… Go.<br/>
&gt; Chie is smiling sadly…<br/>
<br/>
<i>As I started walking down the road, I really couldn't help but notice someone who, um, stood out a bit. I have no idea if people noticed her standing there, but Margaret was just sort of chilling out by the entrance to the Velvet Room.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00151.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Margaret.png"/> …You have come.<br/>
I was waiting for you.<br/>
I wanted to see you before you left.<br/>
Though, parting words aren't what I have for you…<br/>
Remember?<br/>
The heart is shaken more by a single action than by a thousand words…<br/>
Do you know what action will shake both of our hearts…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>You only live once, so they say.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00159.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Margaret.png"/> *chuckle *<br/>
For us residents… I'm sure this is a sin.<br/>
Now… Close your eyes.<br/>
Why, you ask…?<br/>
So that you don't witness my sinfulness.<br/>
Mm…<br/>
&gt; You feel a solid bond between you and Margaret…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Margaret.png"/> Why did I steal a kiss…? Is that what you were going to ask? But it's you who was the thief.<br/>
*chuckle *<br/>
……<br/>
Will I ever see you again, I wonder…?<br/>
Well, then… Farewell.<br/>
<br/>
<i>That the door to the Velvet Room still remained seemed kind of strange, but I moved on. Rise was nearby, outside of Marukyu.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00173.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Souji.png"/> I came to see you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Rise.png"/> Senpai… No… That's like you came to say goodbye…!<br/>
I'm not planning on letting this be the last time we meet!<br/>
…It does make me sad, though.<br/>
I told you before, right? I'm returning to showbiz, starting spring.<br/>
I went to voice training today to prepare myself for that. You see, I'm redebuting myself with a new album!<br/>
I'm writing all the lyrics myself! Well, I got a D in Composition, so they aren't exactly masterpieces…<br/>
…But you know, a lot of stuff's happened while I was on break…<br/>
I made friends… dear friends… Everyone was so nice to me…<br/>
I want to express that to everyone who will listen. My deepest feelings, in my own words.<br/>
Ahh, I'm scared! I'm scared of putting the real me out there for people to see…<br/>
But… I can't give in to that fear, right?<br/>
I'll work hard, for all my fans out there… I'm gonna make a huge comeback!<br/>
…So wish me luck!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Souji.png"/> Of course.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Rise.png"/> *giggle * Thank you, Senpai.<br/>
I know that you'll be watching me on the other side of the camera… I'll keep thinking that way as I work.<br/>
&gt; You feel a close bond between yourself and Rise…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Rise.png"/> I look back at Junes now, and I feel all these good memories of us…<br/>
……<br/>
<br/>
<i>I still can't wait for this commercial.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00194.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Rise.png"/> Then you'll all remember the times we had every time you see it!<br/>
…But then, we'll all feel a bit lonely afterwards, huh…?<br/>
Senpai… I'll see you tomorrow. I'll say goodbye, and I won't cry…<br/>
…I'm so glad that fog's gone.<br/>
I mean, it's still foggy over in the other world, but it's a clear, blue sky over here.<br/>
We can see you off on a happy note… Well, see you later.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It'd been a while since I checked on the fox, so I headed down to the shrine.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00204.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The shrine seems to be prospering, as some objects are shimmering with a golden sheen…<br/>
&gt; You don't see the fox…<br/>
&gt; Perhaps it left…<br/>
<b>Old Man:</b> Hm? What's a young man like you doing in an old place like this?<br/>
This place was bustling with visitors not too long ago, but these days, you see less and less.<br/>
I heard the town was considering tearing the place down because someone stole money from the offertory box.<br/>
Also heard some fox had taken up a home here and they were gonna haul it off to an animal shelter.<br/>
Too many rumors these days.<br/>
Remember that one about how the fog was making everyone sick?<br/>
Or that other one… What was it called? Midnight Radio…? That was popular with the kids, alright.<br/>
My grandson and his friends were all into it.<br/>
Funny, I remember something kinda like that happening when I was a kid, too. Wonder who starts these rumors…<br/>
…Oops, I almost forgot. I was supposed to pick up some juice for my grandson.<br/>
&gt; You wonder if the fox was taken to an animal shelter, as that old man said…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You decided to leave the shrine…<br/>
&gt; You feel a presence watching you…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Things weren't as they seemed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00223.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The fox family seems to be welcoming you…<br/>
&gt; They look like they're doing fine…<br/>
&gt; The fox's happiness reminds you of the close bond you share with it…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I left the foxes, Kanji was by the textile shop so I decided to stop in and talk with him.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00227.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Kanji seems to be panicking for some reason…<br/>
<b>Kanji's Mother:</b> Oh, hello Souji-kun.<br/>
I heard you're leaving tomorrow. You know, Kanji's been acting all say and lonely lately.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> Sh-Shut up, you old bat!!<br/>
<b>Kanji's Mother:</b> I told you not to speak to me that way!<br/>
Anyway, have you told him about the handicraft class?<br/>
Thank you for being such a role model for my son, Souji-kun.<br/>
Come visit here sometime, all right? Goodbye now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> Y-You didn't hear what she said, did you…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Souji.png"/> Handicraft class?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> Ugh…<br/>
See, a buncha customers liked those knitted dolls we sold, and they asked me how to make 'em…<br/>
S-So… I-I'm gonna hold classes on how to do it…<br/>
……<br/>
L-Laught it up, why don't you!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I didn't think it was funny at all.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00245.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> …Senpai.<br/>
It was my decision, though.<br/>
If people wanna learn, and if I can teach 'em… Hell, why not, you know?<br/>
I-I'm still kinda embarrassed, though…<br/>
But, uhh…<br/>
It kinda feels good to do something for other people…<br/>
…Heh.<br/>
It's only 'cause of you that I could face up to who I am, Senpai.<br/>
…Thank you very much!!<br/>
&gt; Kanji has a refreshing smile on his face…<br/>
&gt; You feel a solid bond between you and Kanji…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> Are you gonna say goodbye to the others later?<br/>
…Well, it ain't like this is the last time we'll see each other.<br/>
Our friendship ain't just on the surface… Funny how we got the murder case to thank for that.<br/>
…We put an end to that stuff, right?<br/>
Adachi's in the slammer, and the fog is all cleared up…<br/>
…It's all thanks to you, Senpai.<br/>
……<br/>
Yo, Senpai… When you go, don't turn back around, okay?<br/>
……<br/>
See ya.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I figured Yosuke and Teddie were working, so I headed down to Junes.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00268.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Teddie.png"/> Sensei! I'm super-duper happy that you came to see me!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Yosuke.png"/> Going around saying goodbye, huh?<br/>
What'd you think of the sleepy, peaceful version of Inaba? It must seem weird to you…<br/>
Huh… I wonder why it began just as you arrived here…<br/>
I remember that first time. Sensei and Yosuke, braving the TV world alone…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Teddie.png"/> Boy, I feel so nostalgic!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah. Ever since then, it was just one surprise after another…<br/>
……<br/>
I can't imagine how it's gonna be like, living here without you.<br/>
A quiet, peaceful town, with no need to use our Personas anymore…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Teddie.png"/> I can't imagine it either.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Yosuke.png"/> …That's right, we were right in the middle of the case when you came over to this side.<br/>
A lot of stuff's happened.<br/>
Facing my true self… And you and me got into a fight, too…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Teddie.png"/> Y-Yosuke, did you smack Sensei!? Oooh, how reckless…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Yosuke.png"/> Of course, moron. Best friends gotta fight sometimes to be best friends.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Teddie always takes things too literally.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00285.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Teddie.png"/> Sensei! Bring it on! Let's fight!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Yosuke.png"/> Don't hurt him, man. He's gotta get on that train tomorrow.<br/>
……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Teddie.png"/> Sensei… You're really leaving, huh?<br/>
I'm glad I met you and Yosuke.<br/>
You two completely changed my life…<br/>
And Nana-chan, Yuki-chan and the others, too…<br/>
They all helped me… They gave life to me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Yosuke.png"/> Life…? Come on, man.<br/>
You were the one who wanted to change. That's why you tried so hard to make it happen.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Teddie.png"/> …Thank you so much, Sensei and Yosuke!<br/>
I love you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Yosuke.png"/> "Love" is kinda strong…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Teddie.png"/> I'll take off my outfit if you want!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Yosuke.png"/> L-Let's not…<br/>
&gt; You feel a solid bond between you, Yosuke, and Teddie…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Yosuke.png"/> By the way, is it okay for you to chill here?<br/>
Don't you have somewhere to go?<br/>
Like… meeting someone?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Teddie.png"/> Do you want Teddie to come with you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Yosuke.png"/> No, I think Teddie has to work…<br/>
<br/>
<i>The school was open due to a few activities, so I wandered in for a bit. I thought I saw someone familiar in the drama room, and sure enough I was right.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00312.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Yumi.png"/> I knew you'd come… Hehe.<br/>
I came here today to turn something in and… I felt this wave of nostalgia.<br/>
We used to be in this club together…<br/>
……<br/>
You're leaving tomorrow, right?<br/>
I have something to tell you.<br/>
I haven't really put my thoughts in order yet… But I want you to hear what I have to say.<br/>
Because you're the one who changed how I think, Souji-kun…<br/>
I'm thinking of joining the student council. I figured I should do something for my school.<br/>
I want to take part in some local politics, too. Heheh… The town is voting whether to keep the gas masks.<br/>
I understand why people wouldn't want to see them ever again… But what happens if the fog comes back, y'know?<br/>
Oh, and I've started working at Junes. I'm a cashier at the food court.<br/>
I'd like to try some more of the clubs at school, too. To be honest, I'd like to go back to the drama club.<br/>
……<br/>
I… I want to see and feel the world I live in.<br/>
So, I'm planning to try as many things as I can, as long as the opportunities are there.<br/>
I've been thinking about… what I'm supposed to do in my life.<br/>
That is, I want to find out what the significant meaning in my life is. Why my parents created me.<br/>
Though, if I do find that out, I can't be satisfied with that answer.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I can't believe how many incredible people I got to know here in Inaba.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00332.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Yumi.png"/> I believe the goal of life is… to pass things on to as many people as you can.<br/>
It's not about inheriting blood, or continuing your genetic line. It's more like passing on your memories.<br/>
And since my father passed his down to me… I have to do the same for future generations.<br/>
…Maybe I should start off by getting a boyfriend.<br/>
I mean, I can't be with you, since you're leaving.<br/>
And, anyway, you ran away when I asked you in the first place!<br/>
…I doubt I'll ever find anyone as good as you, though, Souji-kun…<br/>
…I hope we can see each other again. Take care of yourself.<br/>
The fact that I care about you so much won't change, no matter how far we're apart.<br/>
We won't be alone… Bye.<br/>
&gt; Yumi's eager smile cheers you up.<br/>
&gt; You feel a close bond between yourself and Yumi…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was starting to be bothered a bit now, though I wasn't sure by what. Ai was there for some extra class to make up for the days she'd missed, so we talked for a while.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00345.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Ai.png"/> I was gonna go see you later.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Souji.png"/> I came to see you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Ai.png"/> Hahaha, really?<br/>
Then… are you free right now?<br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed up to the roof.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-P4-00350.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Ai.png"/> You stopped me when I was thinking about jumping off.<br/>
Thinking back on it, that was pretty dumb…<br/>
I really need to thank you, Souji.<br/>
You stopped me, and you listened. Thank you.<br/>
…I'm glad I was able to tell you that before you left.<br/>
I… I felt terrible after you rejected me…<br/>
But since you'll be going away, I had to find the courage to tell you…<br/>
…I'll always remember the time I spent with you fondly.<br/>
…Thank you.<br/>
I've been thinking about the future lately.<br/>
Not so much about college, or jobs, or anything like that…<br/>
But that I want to become a nicer person.<br/>
D-Does that sound like a weird goal?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't think that's a weird goal at all.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-P4-00364.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Ai.png"/> I knew you'd understand.<br/>
I'm… I'm glad I met you.<br/>
I don't know what I'd be like if I hadn't…<br/>
……<br/>
Maybe I'd be totally into that Midnight Channel. Oh, and spreading a bunch of rumors, too.<br/>
Ahaha, I could never see that happening to me now.<br/>
…I must have went through a pretty drastic change.<br/>
&gt; Ai has a beaming smile on her face…<br/>
&gt; You feel a close bond between Ai and yourself…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Ai.png"/> End of conversation!<br/>
It made me sooo nervous, saying all that. I've never done it before…<br/>
Why don't you go say goodbye to your other friends? I'm sure they're waiting for you.<br/>
I think I'll head home. My extra class is over.<br/>
……<br/>
No, I'm not gonna say goodbye! I'll see you later, Souji!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was really getting bothered by something now, and how close I was to saying a goodbye I didn't want to wasn't helping. I wandered back by the house and saw Dojima and Nanako getting ready for a walk.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-P4-00380.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Dojima.png"/> Did you see all your friends?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Souji.png"/> "Most of them…"<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Dojima.png"/> I see… Did they all cry?<br/>
…Let me see your face.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed down to the Samegawa.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-P4-00385.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Dojima.png"/> We've only been together for about a year, but kids grow up surprisingly fast.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Nanako.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Dojima.png"/> Nanako…<br/>
Do you remember what we promised?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Nanako.png"/> ……<br/>
Take care of yourself, big bro. Don't get sick.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Souji.png"/> You too, Nanako.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Nanako.png"/> Yup…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Dojima.png"/> Don't look so sad, Nanako.<br/>
We're all family, remember? It doesn't matter if we're apart.<br/>
We can go see him when I get a vacation.<br/>
Then we can talk about everything that's happened since we last saw each other, right?<br/>
…Yeah.<br/>
Will you remember me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean how could I forget my little sister?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-P4-00400.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Nanako.png"/> It's a promise…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Dojima.png"/> Aaah… Come on, don't cry…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Nanako.png"/> I'm not crying!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Dojima.png"/> Oh well…<br/>
I guess all kids end up being pushed around by their parents. Same goes for you, Souji…<br/>
Souji… It wasn't all that long, all things considered, but I did enjoy your time here with us.<br/>
I really do think of you as part of my family.<br/>
I'm surprised m sister's kid would turn out to be such an upstanding young man… Haha…<br/>
……<br/>
Give Nanako a call sometime when you have a spare moment.<br/>
And… you're welcome to come visit us anytime. I'll leave your room just like it is.<br/>
This is your second home, you know.<br/>
&gt; You feel a solid bond between Dojima, Nanako, and yourself…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Nanako.png"/> When I grow up, I want to marry you, big bro…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Dojima.png"/> Hahaha! You're a stud, Souji.<br/>
Sure, Nanako, if he's still available by the time you're an adult.<br/>
But that will be a long time, won't it, Souji? …Right?<br/>
&gt; Dojima smiles, but he's looking straight into your eyes and doesn't seem to be joking…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Dojima.png"/> By the way, have you said goodbye to everyone yet?<br/>
You still have a lot of time today. Why don't you go around Inaba and see everyone who'll miss you?<br/>
Besides, I don't thing you've really had the whole "peaceful small town" experience while you were here.<br/>
……<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dojima was the second one to mention something.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-P4-00423.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Dojima.png"/> Basically, it all happened while you were here in Inaba… I guess it was just a quirk of fate.<br/>
……<br/>
Anyway, you should get going. We'll be going home, too.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I heard Daisuke and Kou from Aiya as I started the long walk back to where I'd seen Naoto earlier, so I dropped in.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-P4-00428.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Daisuke.png"/> …Haha, what a coincidence.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Kou.png"/> We were just talking about you. You should chill with us for a little.<br/>
W-Well…<br/>
You see, we started talking about whether or not all the crazy stuff that happened here was really over, and…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Daisuke.png"/> …We were consoling each other about Souji leaving tomorrow.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Kou.png"/> Why you gotta blurt that stuff out!? That's embarrassing, man!<br/>
To be honest, though… I did wanna see you one last time, but I figured you'd be too busy.<br/>
The next thing I know, you walk right in! It's like man, I was being thoughtful for nothing!<br/>
&gt; You shared a joyful moment with Kou and Daisuke…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Daisuke.png"/> Oh yeah, at this rate, our team might actually have a shot at the summer tournament.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Kou.png"/> For real? You're talking about the nationals, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Daisuke.png"/> If we keep our pace up until then, that is.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Kou.png"/> That's still a huge improvement.<br/>
Heh, probably thanks to all that harsh training of yours. The first-years were all whining about it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Daisuke.png"/> …Yeah, they don't take it seriously.<br/>
But seeing them slack off like that, I now understand why Kou got mad at me.<br/>
I mean, I can clearly tell when someone's not being serious, and it pisses me off a lot.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Kou.png"/> Hahaha! See?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm gonna miss these guys.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-P4-00447.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Daisuke.png"/> …'Course, it would be even better if Souji were sticking around.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Kou.png"/> …Oh well, nothing we can do about that. Time to suck it up.<br/>
Souji… I'll go over to your place sometime, so you better come back here and visit us, too.<br/>
……<br/>
Bahh! Enough of this sad crap! Let's be how we normally are and send him off with a smile!<br/>
So Souji, call me if you find a cute girl that's available, okay?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Daisuke.png"/> Huh? I thought you liked Chi-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Kou.png"/> Ahhh! Shut up! Enough said!!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Daisuke.png"/> Speaking of which, what happened to that promise of yours? You're the one who said we'll have another group date.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Kou.png"/> …You mean you were serious?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Daisuke.png"/> Of course.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Kou.png"/> …Then I got one thing to say: Stop wearing the same damn training clothes!<br/>
Souji, think you can give Daisuke a nice shirt and some pants as a farewell present?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Daisuke.png"/> Hey, I've got more clothes than this, ya know.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Kou.png"/> Yeah, I bet they're all sportswear!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Daisuke.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Kou.png"/> ……<br/>
You better come visit, Souji. I can't handle the dating scene with Daisuke alone.<br/>
The three of us should have a big ol' group date sometime soon!<br/>
&gt; You feel a close bond between Daisuke, Kou, and yourself…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Daisuke.png"/> Well I'm sure you've got more goodbyes to say. We can see you tomorrow anyway.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Kou.png"/> Yeah, don't waste your time on us, man. Even if we're separated-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Daisuke.png"/> We'll always be friends.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Kou.png"/> …Why do you always get to say the good part…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I found Naoto back at Yasogami.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-P4-00472.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Naoto.png"/> Oh, that's right. You're leaving tomorrow… Saying goodbye to your teachers?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Souji.png"/> Not really.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Naoto.png"/> Having a last look at the school, huh?<br/>
……<br/>
Can I come with you?<br/>
<br/>
<i>We went up to the roof.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-P4-00478.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Naoto.png"/> Well… Not that I'm disappointed.<br/>
It's just that… for me to remain here, without you or a case to solve…<br/>
I feel somewhat… listless.<br/>
I know this sounds awkward, since we've already discussed it before and came to a satisfactory conclusion…<br/>
…that the reason for me being here has nothing to do with the case.<br/>
……<br/>
Perhaps it's just your departure that's making me lonely.<br/>
I'm sorry. I'm making trouble for you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Souji.png"/> No, I should apologize.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Naoto.png"/> Please, don't apologize.<br/>
It's not your fault for moving home.<br/>
…I'm sure this is hardly the last time I'll face a situation such as this in my life.<br/>
I'll remain here in Inaba, Senpai.<br/>
Of course, from time to time, my services will be required elsewhere…<br/>
But Inaba is my hometown now.<br/>
I want to treasure the precious time I've spent with you, solving the case together.<br/>
The Midnight Channel, Personas, Ameno-sagiri…<br/>
My duty is to stay here and get to the bottom of these mysteries…<br/>
…To be honest, the thought of it makes me a bit lonely.<br/>
……<br/>
<br/>
<i>If anyone could get to the bottom of mysteries like that, it would be Naoto.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-P4-00499.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Naoto.png"/> …And don't forget about me.<br/>
Please remember the time we spent together… when I confessed my love for you… when you accepted me for who I was.<br/>
&gt; You feel a solid bond between you and Naoto…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Naoto.png"/> I'll be at the station tomorrow with the others…<br/>
So this is our last chance to talk, just the two of us…<br/>
…No, of course it won't be. I can to visit you anytime, and vice versa.<br/>
Senpai… don't you have other farewells to say?<br/>
Don't' worry about me… I'll be fine.<br/>
I'll see you tomorrow!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Well, I'd spoken to everyone, but I still felt like I had something else to do.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-P4-00510.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It's time to go back home to prepare for tomorrow…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I still had to say goodbye to the food court one last time. Anything else just wouldn't be right.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-P4-00512.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You have said goodbye to all the people you have formed close bonds with…<br/>
&gt; You should return to your house to prepare for tomorrow…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Plus, I was increasingly bothered by something. Everyone had been talking about the case, even months after we solved it. It's like they were trying to tell me something…</i><br/>
<br/>
