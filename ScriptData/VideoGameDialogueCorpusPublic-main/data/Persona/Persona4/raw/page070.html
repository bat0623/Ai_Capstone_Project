<i>That guy who was afraid of cats seems to have turned things around.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The man is covered in scratches…<br/>
<b>Ailurophobe:</b> The Red Goldfish you gave me… Thanks to that, the kitties were all over me!<br/>
Ooh, those kittie-witties were soooo cute! The feeling of their soft fur is great!<br/>
I almost want to get married more for the cat than Miyoko-san! Ooh, I want a kitty-kiss!<br/>
&gt; You accomplished the request written on the ema!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think this dude kind of went overboard. Anyway I stopped by with Hisano afterwards.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hisano.png"/> My husband's tsuki meinichi is today, and I've just come back from visiting his grave.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> That must have been tough.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hisano.png"/> Oh, no. The cemetery is right over there. I don't have to walk very far.<br/>
&gt; Hisano smiles gently…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hisano.png"/> Do you know what Death is?<br/>
Death is the entity that takes people to the gods.<br/>
For those trying to reach the gods, and to the families of those people, Death can be an ally.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> I don't really know.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hisano.png"/> When a person dies… the people who are left behind start to grieve, right?<br/>
"Why did that person have to die?" That's the question everyone wants to know the answer to.<br/>
How is it right that this life had to come to an end…?<br/>
The person did nothing wrong, and yet…<br/>
We want to think that they went to the gods…<br/>
They've been summoned to Heaven, and there's nothing we can do about it. We try to convince ourselves of that…<br/>
Sometimes… we look forward to Death taking them up to the gods…<br/>
……<br/>
You don't quite understand it yet, do you?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm sort of happy that I really don't.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hisano.png"/> That's how it should be. The innocence and happiness of youth.<br/>
&gt; Hisano smiles gently…<br/>
&gt; You can feel the kindness in Hisano's heart.<br/>
<br/>
<i>But I'm still not sure why she calls herself Death.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hisano.png"/> I looked forward to Death too much… and became Death myself.<br/>
……<br/>
Before I realized it, I…<br/>
I'm sorry. You don't want to hear this, do you?<br/>
I'm going home now. You be careful, too.<br/>
&gt; You left Hisano and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<b>10/10/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Had the day off today, I decided to talk to Hisano again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hisano.png"/> …Why do you keep coming back?<br/>
It must be boring, listening to this old bag's stories…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> It's actually interesting.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hisano.png"/> Well, you're just a special boy, aren't you?<br/>
&gt; Hisano smiles cheerfully.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hisano.png"/> Enough about me. I want to hear something from you. Tell me anything.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided to talk about my horrible girl-based failures.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You talked about girls.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hisano.png"/> Oh my. I think you're going to break a lot of young ladies' hearts.<br/>
&gt; Hisano smiles cheerfully.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hisano.png"/> I wish I could listen to your stories forever and ever.<br/>
&gt; Hisano is thanking you for spending time with her…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Hisano has grown even deeper.<br/>
<br/>
<i>And that's when she dropped a bombshell on me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hisano.png"/> But… I do not want to see you anymore.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> Why not?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hisano.png"/> I'm sorry… You just remind me of him too much…<br/>
&gt; Hisano smiles sadly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hisano.png"/> Thank you for everything…<br/>
Goodbye…<br/>
&gt; Hisano left…<br/>
&gt; After saying she didn't want to see you again, she left without giving you a chance to respond…<br/>
&gt; What should you do…?<br/>
&gt; The sun has set, so you decide to go home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I have no idea what to do about this, I'll have to think it through.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> We've got midterms later this week, huh?<br/>
Oh, hey! We should have a study session with everybody else after school!<br/>
We're all in the same boat, right? Let's help each other out!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh Chie.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00077.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> That's right, help each other.<br/>
……<br/>
…Okay, so what if I'm more on the "being helped" side than the "helping others" side?<br/>
Come on! Help those of us who are academically-challenged! I'll invite everyone! Please!<br/>
<br/>
<i>It doesn't help that they're still going over new material that'll be on the exams.</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>Ms. Sofue:</b> I'm gonna spend a little time covering the king who served during the golden age of the Bourbon dynasty, Louis XIV…<br/>
Known as one of the most prolific rulers in France, he's also remembered for his famous line, "I am the State."<br/>
His achievements turned France into one of Europe's most prestigious nations, earning him the title of "Sun King."<br/>
He excelled in politics, and he's also the one responsible for building the Palace of Versailles.<br/>
So… the Sun King certainly left his mark in history, but he also had an interesting personal quirk.<br/>
Let's see… Souji, would you stand up, please?<br/>
What part of his physical appearance was the Sun King, Louis XIV, most concerned with?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean you just need to look at a painting of the guy to see he was overcompensating.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Ms. Sofue:</b> Hohoho… You're right. He was a short man, who was concerned about his height.<br/>
One record says he wore shoes with an 8 centimeter heel, and that he even specially ordered his wig.<br/>
That wig alone was an astounding 20 centimeters tall!<br/>
On top of that, he wore a hat with gorgeous feathers so he'd be seen as a great man worthy of being a king. <br/>
Hoho, knowing that, doesn't it make you identify with him a little? Even though he was a monarch, he was still human.<br/>
So… midterms start at the end of this week. Don't forget to review.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed to the food court at Junes after school.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Teddie2.png"/> Hey, greetings to you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Nanako.png"/> Greetings to you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Looks like you're having fun.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Kanji.png"/> Yo.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Rise.png"/> Wow, everyone's here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Nanako.png"/> So many people!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Teddie2.png"/> Why did everyone come here?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Yosuke.png"/> Exam study group!<br/>
*sigh * Times like these, I'm jealous of Teddie…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Come on now. Let's start with proving the trigonometric identities.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> Argh… Jumping straight into math…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Rise.png"/> Ours is the section on trig functions, right? The one where we find the area of a triangle given two sides and-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Kanji.png"/> Huh? You find the area of a triangle with… You know, that thing.<br/>
Uhh, base by height by 2?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Naoto.png"/> If you don't mind, shall I teach you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Yosuke.png"/> Oh? Are you as smart as I thought? Could you uh… lend me a hand too…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Naoto.png"/> Oh, um… I wouldn't know where to begin with second-year subjects.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Yosuke.png"/> Aww… What's up with that? Useless after all…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke's going to get hit one of these days.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00117.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
 <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Yosuke.png"/> Hehehe… I think I've figured out what buttons to push to get Naoto-kun riled up.<br/>
You're pretty cute when you're angry.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Naoto.png"/> Wh-What are you talking about!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Kanji.png"/> That's it, I quit. This just ain't my thing… The hell with the exams. 's time for my animal crackers.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Rise.png"/> Ooh, can I have some too? I wanna find the penguin!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Kanji.png"/> Hands off the penguin! It's mine!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Yosuke.png"/> *sigh * Forget it. I can't think…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Nanako.png"/> Teddie said he doesn't know who he is. That's so weird.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Teddie2.png"/> …My life on this side is really fun.<br/>
But the more I feel that way, the more I want to know who I really am…<br/>
I've surfed the net, read manga, watched TV…<br/>
I even went to a place called the libeary, but I still can't find anything about me…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Yosuke.png"/> Dude, I'd be surprised if you did.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Teddie2.png"/> Still, I'm starting to get an idea…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> An idea?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> Whoa, isn't this your first time sharing a theory about yourself!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>This was definitely more interesting than studying.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00135.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Teddie2.png"/> But now, I have a feeling that it was born from the minds of people on this side…<br/>
And over in that place filled with Shadows, I think I was some sort of special being…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Yosuke.png"/> A "special being"?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Teddie2.png"/> I don't remember anything from back then, though…<br/>
Maybe it's that "amnesia" thing I read about in a book the other day.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Naoto.png"/> It's true… There are some aspects of the other world that make it seem as though it's rooted in human thoughts.<br/>
Still, there's no point in applying the principles of logic and deduction to a place like that…<br/>
But the fact that you existed in such a world from the beginning adds credibility to your theory.<br/>
There is little doubt that you are a "special being" on the other side.<br/>
If you yourself know nothing about it, perhaps it's true that part of your memory is missing.<br/>
Tell me, what is the earliest memory you can call to mind?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Teddie2.png"/> It's from a while ago. I've always lived there, as far as I could tell.<br/>
Then it started to get noisy, so when I happened to bump into Sensei and Yosuke, I asked them to do something about it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Naoto.png"/> I see… If you've always been on that side, you'd have no sense of time or days…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nanako was looking sort of confused, and rightly so.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00150.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> I'm sorry, Nanako-chan. We didn't mean to leave you out…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Nanako.png"/> Hey… I think Teddie must be a king.<br/>
I read in a story that a king was all alone inside a forest because of a bad guy's curse.<br/>
Isn't that what happened to you, Teddie?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Teddie2.png"/> A King… Well! When you put it that way, it sounds about right…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Teddie…? A King…?<br/>
*giggle * I can see him wearing a cape…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> Sheesh, Yukiko… You go into laughing fits in front of anyone now…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Kanji.png"/> Can we… not talk about Teddie being a King…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Yosuke.png"/> Hm? What's with that face…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Teddie2.png"/> Teddie really was a King.<br/>
There were all these other Kings too, and we all-<br/>
<br/>
<i>Okay, not for innocent ears there.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00163.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> Quiet, you! Not in front of Nanako-chan!<br/>
&gt; Everyone left their seats to go buy drinks with Nanako.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Teddie2.png"/> Am I really a King?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> Maybe so.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Teddie2.png"/> Mwahaha! If I am a King, I'll get to smooch girls every day!<br/>
&gt; Teddie is smirking…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Teddie2.png"/> I have this fuzzy feeling that I'll find out sooner or later with your help, Sensei.<br/>
&gt; You sense Teddie's strong trust…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still, his heart's in the right place.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00172.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Nanako.png"/> Big bro, Teddie, is melon soda okay?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm sure we'll learn the truth one day.</i>
