<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Too much stuff happened yesterday. I hope she's back to her usual self…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Oh, mornin'.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Yep.<br/>
……<br/>
Um… Thanks for everything yesterday.<br/>
It's kind of embarrassing, ya know?<br/>
You two were there to see my hidden feelings and all…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Don't sweat it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> The same thing happened to Yosuke, right?<br/>
Soooo… what was it like?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Huh? Uhhh, how should I put this…<br/>
Oh, I nearly forgot! None of that happened when yours awakened, huh?<br/>
Hmmm, could that be because you've got nothing to hide?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Oh? So nothing happened for you?<br/>
I gotta agree that you seem like a pretty open guy. There's a funny air about you…<br/>
I dunno, I guess that's what draws people to you, or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie's got a really funny way of saying nice things about people.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Haha, yep, it's a compliment.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Uh… if you say so…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Anyways, what's most important right now is to rescue Yukiko.<br/>
I'm dead set on coming. Remember… You promised.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Oh crap, I still haven't gone to the bathroom!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke ran off. Better than asking Morooka to take a piss, he gets really livid.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Th-Thanks for saving me…<br/>
Yosuke's cool and all, but…<br/>
There really is something different about you. I feel like you won't let me down…<br/>
&gt; You sense Chie's gratitude to you…<br/>
&gt; You feel a faint bond forming between you and Chie…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And that's how I formed a social link with Chie.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You haven't yet asked Chie for her contact information.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I have the guts to face down a giant monster, but not to ask a girl for her phone number straight out. Then again, the worst thing the giant monster can do is kill me…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Oh… right. You'll need this from now on, huh?<br/>
&gt; You exchanged cell numbers with Chie.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> We have to be careful of the fog that sets in after the rain, right? Let's save her before that happens!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We returned to the TV world that afternoon. We began to realize right from the start that this wouldn't be as easy as we thought.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Teddie.png"/> Sensei, can I bother you for a second?<br/>
The road here seems different from yesterday, so this place might get pretty tricky…<br/>
I'll do my best to remember where we walked, so try not to get lost, Sensei.<br/>
Anyways, I don't sense anyone around this area.<br/>
If you go further ahead, we might be able to find something.<br/>
Be careful and move on.<br/>
<br/>
<i>As if the Shadows weren't bad enough, it seemed this place's layout wasn't even fixed. Teddie warned us something was waiting behind the door where we'd fought Chie's shadow, and sure enough he was right.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yukiko-san! Are you all right!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Yukiko… what's wrong?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Everything was definitely not alright, though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00113.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Shadow_Yukiko.png"/> Oh my! Special guests? I wonder how they'll play into all this!<br/>
*chuckle * Things are really heating up!<br/>
Okie-dokie! I'm going back to the hunt for my Prince Charming! Ohhh, where could he be…?<br/>
This place is huge! It's sooo exciting, but it makes it so hard to find him!<br/>
Ooh! Maybe he's playing hide-and-seek in the fog! Ready or not, here I come!<br/>
Let's go further in then, shall we!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>When I say that's when things got weird, I need you to understand that in context of the fact that we were in a magical princess castle inside a TV infested with evil spirits.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00120.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Wh-What the hell is this!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> You're… You're not Yukiko… Who are you!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Shadow_Yukiko.png"/> *chuckle * What're you talking about? I'm Yukiko… and Yukiko is me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> No! Don't tell me, are you--!?<br/>
Where's the real Yukiko!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> What's with these voices…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Teddie.png"/> The Shadows are getting agitated!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Shadow_Yukiko.png"/> Well, I'm off again!<br/>
Heehee! You'd better be waiting with bells on, my dear Prince!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Hey, wait!<br/>
That clearly wasn't the real Yukiko. It had to be…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Teddie.png"/> I think it was. It must have been the other part of herself.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> So it's just like what happened to us…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Teddie does make some good points every now and then.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00134.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Teddie.png"/> The real Yukiko wants to show us something. I can feel it.<br/>
It's hard to explain… It seems like she has a strong connection to this castle.<br/>
This is a lot more dangerous than I thought!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Yukiko…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hey… Not again! Dammit, we told her not to run off on her own!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie didn't get far before we stopped her and calmed her down again. As we pushed on, things got stranger and stranger.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Shadow_Yukiko.png"/> *chuckle * Teeheehee…<br/>
My Prince will soon come for me.<br/>
*chuckle *<br/>
I'll always be waiting…<br/>
Forever and ever…<br/>
……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Teddie.png"/> Hrmmm…<br/>
I hear voices, but the only things I sense here are Shadows and you guys.<br/>
Sensei and Shadows… Oooh, there we go!<br/>
*snrk *<br/>
Hey Sensei! Listen to this.<br/>
When you attack Shadows from behind, Sense will have a Sensei-tional advantage!<br/>
Sensei's Sensai-tional advantage! Heeheehee…<br/>
<br/>
<i>If only we could deploy Teddie's puns against the Shadows.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Thank you for coming to the Amagi Inn today.<br/>
Your room is right this way.<br/>
If we can help you in any way, please let us know immediately.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Teddie.png"/> …What's this voice talking about?<br/>
This place isn't an inn. It's totally a castle!<br/>
<br/>
<i>And on the fifth floor, Teddie gave us some good news.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Shadow_Yukiko.png"/> Hmhmhm… Ohoho…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Teddie.png"/> I can sense her!<br/>
She must be on this floor!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Shadow_Yukiko.png"/> Wow! By any chance, are you…<br/>
My Princes?<br/>
I'm locked up here… Please save me!<br/>
Hmhmhm… I'm sure my Princes can do it…<br/>
I'm sure they'll brave any danger to release me from this place…<br/>
I'll be waiting for you…<br/>
Ohoho…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Teddie.png"/> This seems very strange…<br/>
Be careful.<br/>
<br/>
<i>The damn floor was pretty confusing. If we tried to advance, we'd be teleported away. What's more, half the doors were locked up tight. We realized, though, that we could travel forward by backtracking after we were teleported away. And soon, Teddie told us we'd found the right door.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Teddie.png"/> It's that girls' scent!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We rushed in, and immediately regretted it.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> My Prince wouldn't lose to guards such as this, correct?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Teddie.png"/> Gyaaaaaah! I've never seen such a strong one before!<br/>
I-It's attacking us!<br/>
<br/>
<b>Sub-Boss: Avenger Knight</b><br/>
Here's our first mid-level Shadow boss. This one's pretty simple. It uses powerful physical attacks and is only really vulnerable to magic. All we have to do is pound spells out into him and heal when we need to, easy as can be.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We smashed the Shadow, but by the time we were done Yukiko had already vanished. We also found the key to the level's doors, but were just in no shape to continue.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00145.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Shadow_Yukiko.png"/> If you really are my Prince, then we will surely meet again.<br/>
I am but a trapped soul… I cannot leave this place even if I wished…<br/>
*chuckle *<br/>
……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Teddie.png"/> I don't sense her anymore…<br/>
……<br/>
Oh! Are you okay, Sensei?<br/>
I'm sure we've got a long way to go. Don't push yourself too hard!<br/>
If you're tired, you should head back!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We're no good to Yukiko dead, so we returned to the real world. The rains aren't coming for a while, so we still have time.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>4/19/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>It turns out supernatural people can totally just call you up on your cell whenever they want.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00155.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Margaret.png"/> I realize this is sudden, but…<br/>
I'm Margaret. We met at the Velvet Room the other day.<br/>
There is one important point I forgot to warn you about, so I thought it best to contact you immediately.<br/>
Going to save your friends is a selfless and noble deed…<br/>
By all means, we encourage and support you in regards to this matter.<br/>
But to proceed to hastily in that quest will mean facing one battle after the next.<br/>
Though you may be pressed for time, devoting yourself to battles will not quench your heart's yearnings.<br/>
The bonds created through Social Links are another important means of strengthening the powers of your Persona…<br/>
Do not hasten heedlessly through your days, and remember the importance of moving at a sustainable pace.<br/>
Please remember that. Well then, if you'll excuse me…<br/>
<br/>
<i>She's probably right. This has already been getting harder, and if what I do outside the TV is just as important to becoming stronger I can't neglect it. As I walked to school, I heard something interesting.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00169.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Braided Girl:</b> Weren't you asking the same thing last year? And the year before that?<br/>
<b>Chatty Girl:</b> Was I?<br/>
Well, whatever. I shouldn't join a sports team. I need to focus on my entrance exams this year!<br/>
I need to choose which shrine to wish for luck at with my mother so I can pass the exams.<br/>
I don't want to go to the shrine near the shopping district, 'cuz it's all shady and creepy, you know…?<br/>
Not only that, but I heard a rumor that there's something living in that shrine!<br/>
…I wonder if it's true…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I've been feeling how out of shape I got last year a lot in the TV world, so I decided to see what sports clubs were accepting people. Of course it just had to be Morooka in the Faculty Office.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00178.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Morooka.png"/> Ohhh, no! I know what you're really after! You're just trawling for girls, aren't you!? Admit it!<br/>
Listen up! A club is supposed to be…<br/>
&gt; For some reason, you find yourself getting lectured…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Morooka.png"/> So, still want to join a club?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I asked him about the sports clubs.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00184.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Morooka.png"/> …You can join either the soccer club or the basketball club.<br/>
After leaving the faculty office, make a left, and go through the exit to get to where the sports clubs meet!<br/>
By the way, club days are Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday! Sports clubs don't meet on rainy days! Got it!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I excused myself rather than talk with Morooka for even one more second. I used to play soccer quite a bit back in the day, so it was an obvious choice.</i><br/>

<b>P. E. Teacher:</b> He's from the city, so I'm sure he's got some moves he's just waiting to show off!<br/>
I'd say this season is in the bag! I'm even thinking about making him captain!<br/>
&gt; You can hear the other players whispering…<br/>
<b>Team Members:</b> The city, huh?<br/>
I bet he played for some big team back home…<br/>
Tch, look at him. City slicker…<br/>
Probably thinks he's better than us…<br/>
Yeah, we're just a bunch of hicks to him…<br/>
<b>P.E. Teacher:</b> Here, why don't you say something to the team?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Even though they were being huge dicks to me I decided to play it cool.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00199.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Team Members:</b> …Yeah.<br/>
&gt; They don't seem very friendly…<br/>
<b>P.E. Teacher:</b> Alright, let's start with a few laps! Souji, why don't you just watch for today?<br/>
Practices are on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, but we don't practice in the rain.<br/>
We take the week before exams off too, so make sure you use that time to study hard, okay?<br/>
&gt; The other players, showing on interest in you, dispersed about the field…<br/>
<br/>
<i>One guy stayed behind, though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00207.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Daisuke.png"/> Don't let 'em get to you. Just play hard and have fun.<br/>
I'm Daisuke Nagase. Second year, same as you. Nice to meet you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Kou.png"/> Yo Daisuke, you waiting for a special inviation? Let's go!<br/>
Oh, hey, you're the transfer student, right? Joined the soccer team, huh?<br/>
Good, 'cause they need all the help they can get. Pretty weak team, know what I'm saying?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Daisuke.png"/> Shut up! Your team is just as lame!<br/>
This big mouth here is Kou. He's the same grade as us, but he's on the basketball team.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Daisuke and Kou seemed like decent guys at least.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00215.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Daisuke.png"/> Man, get your head outta the clouds.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Kou.png"/> Hey, and that's not all! I'm pretty smart too, so if you need any help on your tests, I'm your man.<br/>
…How 'bout it, transfer student? You a smart guy?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Daisuke.png"/> Stop calling him that.<br/>
The team's already giving him enough crap as it is…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Kou.png"/> Ahhh, I can hear it now. "Us country folk ain't gonna get shown up by now big shot city boy!" Gotta love those guys.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Daisuke.png"/> It's not funny, man…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Kou.png"/> Well, as long as he's got some skills, they'll back off sooner or later.<br/>
You played much soccer before, Souji?<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's been a while, but back in the day yeah.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-P4-00225.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Kou.png"/> Then this'll be easy, right?<br/>
&gt; You became friends with Kou Ichijo of the basketball team and Daisuke Nagase of the soccer team.<br/>
&gt; They accepted you regardless of the rest of the team's hostility…<br/>
&gt; You feel a faint bond forming between the three of you…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And for the second time in two days I formed a link with someone.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-P4-00230.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Daisuke.png"/> Dammit, now I'm behind on my laps.<br/>
Souji, wait up for me so we can walk home together.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Kou.png"/> Alright, I'll go get changed. See you in a few.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Not much else to report today. We're still getting ready for our next trip into the TV.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>4/20/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke actually does have a lot of good ideas. Earlier today he suggested something I myself had tried earlier.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-P4-00237.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, hey, I came up with an idea I've been meaning to ask you about.<br/>
We're able to enter TVs now…<br/>
Have you ever tried sticking your hand into a TV when something's on?<br/>
Like, have you ever touched a TV when the Midnight Channel was on?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-P4-00242.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> You tried it out already!? Oho, now that's our leader!<br/>
But, I see… So you can't just go to the same place that's on the screen.<br/>
So my plan to jump right to where Yukiko-san is while she's on the screen wouldn't work, then…<br/>
I thought it might work if there was a direct connection between what's on the TV and where you end up…<br/>
But then again, it makes sense that it doesn't work that way.<br/>
Different TVs are connected to different places, but everybody can watch the Midnight Channel.<br/>
That's kind of a contradiction, isn't it?<br/>
Then I guess there's no other way but through that castle, no matter how dangerous it might be…<br/>
Still, I'm sure Yukiko-san is in a lot more pain than we are! We can't complain about stuff like this!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke was in some trouble later, too.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-P4-00252.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Hosoi:</b> My name is Mr. Hosoi, and in this class you'll be learning about contemporary writing. Let's all have fun.<br/>
I know this is off-topic, but what's the point of applying for colleges outside Inaba? Why even bother?<br/>
Nothing good ever comes out of competing with city-folk. The country side is all you need.<br/>
Mmmhmm. Well, let's practice our spelling. Which of the following words is spelled correctly?<br/>
You! Hana-chan! You're just the kind of guy who relies on his PC's spell check!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Huh!? Well, he got that right, but…<br/>
…Souji! Help me out here?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Poor Yosuke.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-P4-00260.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Hosoi:</b> Ooh, good job, Hana-chan! The word "millennium" is very commonly misspelled.<br/>
As you know, the word "millennium" comes from the Latin word "mille," meaning "thousand," and "annum," meaning "year."<br/>
Remember when 1999 became the year 2000? Lots of words came out of that shift, like millennium baby, or millennium bug.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Phew… You're a life saver, Souji. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
<i>After school, we decided to take a break and headed down to the shopping district.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-P4-00277.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The famous steak croquettes are tough…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Sticking chunks of steak in croquettes… Man, this really is the country, huh?<br/>
Well, it is good… though it's tough.<br/>
Chie called this stuff "tender and juicy"… What kinda teeth does she have…?<br/>
&gt; You can hear the women's conversation…<br/>
<br/>
<i>A couple of the women from the shopping district walked by.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-P4-00283.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Talkative Lady:</b> His classmate… Sato-san…? Went out of business…<br/>
<b>Gossiping Lady:</b> This shopping district could disappear, and yet…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Sorry about that. You know me, I'm infamous around here.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-P4-00287.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Nahhh, it's not really.<br/>
It's mainly my parents; I'm not personally involved. Anyways, there's nothing I can do about it.<br/>
&gt; Yosuke shrugs…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I don't think there's anyone in Inaba who doesn't know me, at school or around town…<br/>
Not that I mind, but… It sucks that I always gotta mind my manners.<br/>
&gt; Yosuke smiles cheerfully…<br/>
&gt; You feel you understand Yosuke a bit more…<br/>
<br/>
<i>This feels slightly different than establishing a new link, but I did feel something.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Still, this croquette is damn good, huh?<br/>
I'm gonna have another. You want one too, right?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I've made up my mind, we're going back in on Friday. That should give us plenty of time to rest up and get ready.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>4/21/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>We had a bit of a scare when the rains started in the morning.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-P4-00299.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I hear that it's gonna be sunny for a while, starting this afternoon.<br/>
Looks like we're not gonna have to worry about the fog for now.<br/>
The fog always sets in around the morning after it's rained for a few days.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-P4-00303.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah.<br/>
Let's keep our cool, make sure we're ready, and rescue Yukiko-san, no matter what!<br/>
<br/>
<i>The rain cleared up, though. I decided to get another workout, and headed to soccer practice.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-P4-00317.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean it's a horrible dick move to throw this all on me but whatever.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Soccer Player:</b> Haha, later!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Daisuke.png"/> ……?<br/>
What were those guys saying to you?<br/>
&gt; You told Daisuke that you're going to tear down the goals and clean up.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Daisuke.png"/> What? Everyone's supposed to take turns…<br/>
You don't have to do that, man. Let's just go home.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Kou.png"/> Hey guys… Hm, did the soccer team finish early today?<br/>
…What's wrong?<br/>
&gt; You told Kou that you're going to tear down the goals and clean up.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Kou.png"/> Let me guess, they told you it was your job? Tch… how predictable.<br/>
But yeah, you should probably do it anyway.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Daisuke.png"/> How come? They got no right to dump it all on him…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Kou.png"/> Don't do it because they told you to, do it because you "want to help." That'll throw 'em off guard.<br/>
Here, I'll help out too. It'll go faster.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was much harder work than I'd expected, it was a good thing they stayed around.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-P4-00335.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Daisuke.png"/> That's because you got into polishing those balls, man. You gotta pace yourself.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Kou.png"/> Nah, it's not my style to half-ass things.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Daisuke.png"/> Still, it went pretty fast with three people.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-P4-00339.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Daisuke.png"/> No problem.<br/>
&gt; Daisuke looks happy.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Kou.png"/> Hey, you wanna grab some ramen on the way home?<br/>
&gt; Clean-up went quickly thanks to their help.<br/>
&gt; You sense their consideration towards you…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-P4-00345.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed to Aiya. I saw something about a rainy day special, I need to check that out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-P4-00349.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Kou.png"/> Hey, I saw that first-year at your practice today, Daisuke.<br/>
She was watching you the entire time, man. I even heard her say, "Wow, he kicked the ball so hard!"<br/>
I mean, duh… that's kinda the point of the game…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Daisuke.png"/> …I didn't notice.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Kou.png"/> Really? What a waste.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Daisuke.png"/> Enough of that crap. Souji, wanna stay after practice to work on your game a little more?<br/>
Let's show those guys what you can do.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Kou.png"/> Yeah, that's a good idea. If you can run circles around them, they'll have to accept you, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Daisuke.png"/> Exactly. Then it's decided.<br/>
You're helping too, Kou.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Kou.png"/> What? Since when do I have anything to do with the soccer team…?<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; The three of you discussed practice.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's good to get one last bit of normalcy in. We're going back in tomorrow, and we're going to save Yukiko, come hell or high water.</i><br/>
