			<b>9/11/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>Rise and I went to Okina earlier today.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You walked Rise home after a trip to Okina City…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Rise.png"/> *giggle * I placed lots of special orders.<br/>
Come with me next time when I go pick 'em up, Senpai.<br/>
I had tons of fun today. Not many people tried to come up and talk…<br/>
…Maybe they already forgot who I am.<br/>
Oh, yeah. Want some tofu to take home?<br/>
I helped make them today.<br/>
Wait right here.<br/>
<b>Man's Voice:</b> Excuse me… Souji-san, is it?<br/>
<b>Inoue:</b> Ummm… Sorry about the other day…<br/>
I'm Minoru Inoue, Rise Kujikawa's former manager.<br/>
I'm sorry to bother you, but… Could you give this to her?<br/>
&gt; Inoue handed you a letter…<br/>
<b>Inoue:</b> A fan letter came, you see…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I didn't have a problem giving it to her really but I wasn't sure what his deal was.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Inoue:</b> I'm one of her fans myself. Her talent is captivating…<br/>
Rise always looked forward to this girl's letters, so I…<br/>
In today's cult of personality, being popular carries its own problems.<br/>
Your schedule fits together, minute by minute, like a jigsaw puzzle… Every day you're squeezed utterly dry…<br/>
But even knowing that, I still want her to come back…<br/>
She was genuinely brilliant… Not only that, but she's strong enough to use her pain as a foundation.<br/>
From what I could see… she's relying on you.<br/>
So could you…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Rise.png"/> Sorry, Senpai, but we're all sold out…<br/>
Inoue-san!? Quit pestering me!<br/>
Wait… What did you say to Senpai!?<br/>
<b>Inoue:</b> I-I'm sorry. I'm leaving now… Goodbye…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Rise.png"/> Hounding me even after I quit… He's practically a stalker!<br/>
To think I trusted him… I feel betrayed!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't think I agree with Rise entirely as to why he's here.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Rise.png"/> No… He just wants Risette back.<br/>
The "me" he created…<br/>
&gt; Rise is biting her lip…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Rise.png"/> So… what did he come for?<br/>
&gt; You told Rise why Inoue came and handed her the fan letter.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Rise.png"/> This letter…<br/>
She wrote again…<br/>
I see… But he came all the way out here for this…?<br/>
……<br/>
This girl is a middle school student. She writes to me all the time.<br/>
I did this public service campaign once to stamp out bullying…<br/>
She said it inspired her… She wrote that she wouldn't let bullies get her down, that she'd try to make friends…<br/>
Ever since then, she wrote me letters… "This happened to me today," "I was able to say this," stuff like that.<br/>
"Seeing Risette work hard encourages me," "It makes me feel like I can still hang in there…"<br/>
Haha, she doesn't really know how it works, huh?<br/>
But still, every time I read her letters, I felt like Risette actually meant something…<br/>
So whenever things got tough, I would read them over and over…<br/>
Senpai… Do you still have some free time…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed to the shrine.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Rise.png"/> Officially, I'm taking a break due to illness, so…<br/>
……<br/>
Before I quit, there was talk about a part in a movie…<br/>
She sounds like she was really looking forward to it…<br/>
"Please get well soon and come back," she says…<br/>
……<br/>
I'm so glad you were here. I was scared to read it alone…<br/>
I gave up being Risette. I can't meet her expectations…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Souji.png"/> Having second thoughts?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Rise.png"/> I have no regrets.<br/>
…At least, I think not.<br/>
I mean, it was such a relief to quit. To go back to being the real me…<br/>
Haha…<br/>
……<br/>
&gt; Rise has a lonely smile on her face…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Rise.png"/> Anyway, Risette doesn't exist anymore.<br/>
It's not just this girl. I disappointed lots of other people…<br/>
The president of the company told me that over and over, and I knew already…<br/>
I knew this was the path I chose, but…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think despite everything she says Rise really is having some second thoughts about quitting.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00072.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Rise.png"/> Maybe I'll just inherit the tofu shop!<br/>
I'm the shop's main attraction now. I bet I could make it thrive!<br/>
…Senpai.<br/>
Maybe we should really just do it… Y'know, what I was saying a while back.<br/>
You could marry me once we graduate high school, and the two of us could work at the tofu shop together.<br/>
Doesn't that sound fun? H-How about it? Haha… ha…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Of course she was joking so I played along.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Rise.png"/> ……<br/>
Senpai, you'll say that to just anyone, huh?<br/>
It's dangerous to try to tell everyone what they want to hear…<br/>
Too bad, though! Risette wasn't fooled.<br/>
&gt; Rise is smiling…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Rise.png"/> Thank you, Senpai. For being with me all of today…<br/>
I feel a bit better.<br/>
Yeah… I'm fine.<br/>
I can contribute something…<br/>
And it looks like there are still plenty of things only I can do…<br/>
&gt; You can sense Rise's quiet will…<br/>
&gt; You feel that you understand Rise even more…<br/>
<br/>
<i>While going by a TV Rise said she thought she could almost feel the Shadows behind it, so I think her Persona's gotten stronger as well.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00093.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Rise.png"/> Sorry for dragging you around all day.<br/>
I'll let you go now.<br/>
&gt; You walked Rise to her house and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<b>9/12/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I think Rise was right by the way that I say way too much stuff that's what people want to hear without thinking things through. More on that later.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Kashiwagi.png"/> Don't you all feel just a bit more mature now that you've visited an urban area like that?<br/>
Oh, by the way… That cute bear that Souji-kun had on the trip…<br/>
Where'd you get that?<br/>
I get soooo tempted by animals with such unique design.<br/>
Speaking of bears, some species feed on salmon. And speaking of salmon, I have an interesting fact for you.<br/>
They're actually a white fish. That orangish color actually comes from the pigment of the shellfish.<br/>
Salmon roe is also affected by the shellfish. Hence, a salmon's color is affected by its environment.<br/>
*giggle * The same thing goes for girls. I hope the city brought you ladies that much closer to becoming women.<br/>
&gt; You listened to the lecture intently…<br/>
<br/>
<i>So first off that girl from the roof had run into a bit of a problem with what I'd told her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00110.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The awkward girl is teary-eyed…<br/>
<b>Awkward Girl:</b> Your lesson didn't work!<br/>
I just tried starting up a cheerful conversation with a girl in my class…<br/>
B-But I got nervous all of a sudden… I said something I wasn't even thinking!<br/>
"Move aside, ugly' I'm comin' through!"<br/>
Wh-What should I do? She just started crying…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Souji.png"/> Apologize to her.<br/>
&gt; Your current Courage allows you to give a passionate speech about courage!<br/>
&gt; You instructed her about the social importance of having the courage to apologize for your mistakes.<br/>
<b>Awkward Girl:</b> Y-You're right… I'll apologize to her. Hurting others without apologizing is selfish and cowardly…<br/>
I'll go apologize.<br/>
Maybe after I do, I can try and have a real conversation with her.<br/>
I can't keep using my bad conversation skills as an excuse… I'll do my best.<br/>
&gt; The awkward girl appears to have broken through the fear that was stunting her social growth…<br/>
&gt; You accomplished the request written on the ema!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I went to drama after that. Yumi came, but wasn't practicing with us.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00136.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Yumi is still standing there absentmindedly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Souji.png"/> What's wrong?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yumi.png"/> Oh… Sorry, I didn't realize it was over already…<br/>
After trying to act again, it's so different from the way it was before…<br/>
I can't step into the role.<br/>
I can't become a different me… I don't want to…<br/>
&gt; Yumi smiles sadly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yumi.png"/> There's… There's no one who will say my name like that anymore…<br/>
No one… to call me "Yumi" with that… That voice full of love…<br/>
No one, anywhere…<br/>
&gt; Yumi clenches her teeth…<br/>
<br/>
<i>So like I was saying before, in my haste to help the people I care about out I seem to say and do stuff that in retrospect wasn't a great idea.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00148.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yumi.png"/> Huh…? *sob * …Waaaaaaaaaaaah!<br/>
&gt; Yumi begins to cry like a dam has broken inside her.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yumi.png"/> I-I hated him. I despised him.<br/>
&gt; Yumi's voice trembles as she speaks…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yumi.png"/> I wanted to know why he left us…<br/>
But I didn't want to know how he felt about us…<br/>
I didn't want to feel sorry for myself and my mom, for him leaving us!<br/>
…That's why I decided to act like I never had a father.<br/>
Since the day he abandoned us, I stopped thinking about him.<br/>
And I stopped thinking about myself, too…<br/>
…I just wanted to run away from all of that. I wanted to look the other way from my entire life!<br/>
What… What should I do now…?<br/>
What did they mean by "bear fruit"…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>She's the only one who can figure that out for herself.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00163.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yumi.png"/> Do what I can…? But what can I do…?<br/>
&gt; Yumi thinks while she cries…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yumi.png"/> Souji-kun…<br/>
Just today…<br/>
Just this one day…<br/>
Don't… leave me alone…<br/>
&gt; Yumi trembles helplessly…<br/>
&gt; You can feel that Yumi trusts you greatly…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Poor Yumi.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00172.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; After waiting for Yumi to calm down, you walked her to her house, then went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Anyway now we have other things to worry about.</i><br/>

<b>Announcer:</b> A suspect in the murders in Inaba was safely arrested recently.<br/>
But what few people know is that the mastermind who brought him to justice was a high school detective.<br/>
Tonight's report will focus on this Detective Prince, Naoto Shirogane, whose handsome looks are sweeping the nation.<br/>
Thanks for being on the show.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Naoto.png"/> No, no, the pleasure is all mine.<br/>
&gt; Naoto is on TV…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Nanako.png"/> Oh, his uniform is the same as yours.<br/>
<b>Announcer:</b> First, congratulations to you and the police for your recent arrest of the culprit.<br/>
It was well-known that there were a lot of mysteries surrounding this case, and you did a great job clearing them up.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Naoto.png"/> I'd hesitate to say that the matter is "cleared up," as such.<br/>
It's true that our suspect was behind Mr. Morooka's unfortunate death.<br/>
But when I cast my eye over the case as a whole, I detect a few things that seem out of place.<br/>
<b>Announcer:</b> Oh… Like what?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Naoto.png"/> Unfortunately, I cannot divulge details at this time.<br/>
But this matter claimed the lives of three people. Hence, I believe even the smallest inconsistency must be investigated.<br/>
<b>Announcer:</b> I… I see. I have to say, this is a surprise in light of the police's official statement.<br/>
N-Now for our next segment, "The Detective Prince's True Identity," where Naoto-kun tells us a little bit about himself.<br/>
Amazingly, the Detective Prince has solved a whopping 24 cases. 16 of them were…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Nanako.png"/> There's a detective at your school?<br/>
When I'm older, I'm gonna go to your school too!<br/>
&gt; The breezy evening passes…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I have a bad feeling about this.</i><br/>
