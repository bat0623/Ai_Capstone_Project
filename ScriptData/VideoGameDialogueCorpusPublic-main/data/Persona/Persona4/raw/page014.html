<br/>
<i>Yukiko had been out for quite some time, it was good to see her back.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Y-Yeah… I'll be coming to school again, so… That'll be nice.<br/>
I caused everyone some real trouble.<br/>
I'm sorry…<br/>
No, "sorry" isn't quite right… What I mean to say is, thank you.<br/>
&gt; Yukiko seems more cheerful than before.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> My mother's back to work already.<br/>
The maids are being really supportive, and I think things are going even smoother than before.<br/>
I wonder if I was trying too hard…<br/>
I may have been too caught up in the idea that I had to do everything by myself.<br/>
Ever since the incident… I feel like I can think about these things more calmly.<br/>
B-But… it's still kind of embarrassing…<br/>
You guys saw everything… Even the things I didn't want to admit…<br/>
<br/>
<i>She shouldn't feel bad, though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> I'd like to believe that…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Yukiko!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Oh, it's Chie.<br/>
Well, I'll talk to you later.<br/>
&gt; Yukiko has come back as energetic as ever.<br/>
&gt; It's a good thing you were able to save her…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Mr. Yamada is seriously creepy as fuck, too.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Yamada:</b> Ooops! I mean, all of you are cute! No, really!<br/>
Er, please, don't tell your parents that I said that, will ya? I don't wanna get in trouble.<br/>
Ahem, anyway, I have an interesting topic for you today. Close your books and take a look at the handout.<br/>
Sounds like a good time to pick on the city boy, Souji-kun.<br/>
Which of the following is the highest mountain in the solar system?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean it's a dead giveaway when you mention that it's in the solar system.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Yamada:</b> Wow, you really are from the city! …Well, I guess that doesn't have anything to do with it. Hahaha.<br/>
On the planet Mars, Mt. Olympus, or "Olympus Mons," has an elevation three times that of Mt. Everest!<br/>
People tend to think Everest is the highest mountain, but that's thinking inside the worldwide box.<br/>
Since you got me started on mountains, I'm gonna cover some material on their characteristics…<br/>
<br/>
<i>After school, we all got together on the roof. Chie and Yukiko had some instant noodles, maybe they'd missed lunch.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Thanks! Oooh, that smells gooood…<br/>
These instant noodles are just the thing to help me through club… How much longer do I have to wait on this?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> It still needs a few minutes.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> So, why're we here…? Oh yeah, we were going to ask Yukiko what happened.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> Yukiko-san, I hate to bring up stuff you'd rather not think about… But I need to ask you again.<br/>
Do you recall anything about when you got kidnapped?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> No…<br/>
I thought I might remember something if I let it sit for a while, but as time passes it only gets hazier…<br/>
I think… the doorbell rang at the entrance… and someone called for me…<br/>
But when I woke up after that, I was already in the castle…<br/>
I'm sorry.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> No need to apologize.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie had drawn the same conclusion from that as I had.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> I don't know… If it's true, then that's one daring criminal. What kind of killer would ring the doorbell?<br/>
The police are probably looking for witnesses… but I don't think we can expect much from them.<br/>
Heh, as if the culprit wore bright yellow clothes at the scene of the crime.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> I wonder why whoever it is would do stuff like this.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> We won't know until we confront 'em ourselves…<br/>
But we can be sure of one thing. It's no coincidence that people keep ending up in that place.<br/>
Someone on our side is definitely kidnapping them and throwing them into the TV.<br/>
It's murder, all right…<br/>
Oh yeah, we never told you.<br/>
This guy and me are gonna catch the culprit ourselves!<br/>
The police are out of their league on this case, but we got Personas.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Since Yukiko's got the power as well, I decided to just straight ask if she would team up with us.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Huh? Um…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> I'm helping out too!<br/>
I can't believe someone would throw people into a place like that. I'm gonna sock whoever's doing this!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Chie…<br/>
…Let me help too.<br/>
I want to know why this is happening.<br/>
…Especially if someone hates me so much they want to kill me.<br/>
I don't want to run away from myself anymore.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> Alright! Then let's all work together and catch this asshole!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Agreed.<br/>
<br/>
<i>With Yukiko on board, it felt like we were one step closer to solving this even if we didn't have a single new lead.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00077.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Oh, but how're we going to find them? We don't have a single lead yet.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> I'm the third one to be targeted so far… But I have a feeling this isn't the end of it.<br/>
If we had an idea who might be targeted next, wouldn't we have an advantage over the killer?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> So we'll outsmart them, huh…? Yeah, that might work.<br/>
Okay, so let's see if we can figure out what ties the victims together.<br/>
First, there was that announcer, Mayumi Yamano. Second was Saki Konishi… Senpai. Third was Yukiko Amagi.<br/>
What do they all have in common…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I threw the obvious out there.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00087.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> Bingo.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> How dare he target females! Now that is unforgivable! This culprit's gotta be some kinda pervert…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> Also, what about this? The second and third victims had some sort of connection to the first one.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Hey, that's right. Yukiko and Saki-senpai both had connections to that announcer…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> That's true.<br/>
Then… does that mean females connected in some way to Ms. Yamano's case are being targeted…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> I think that's a safe assumption for now.<br/>
There's another angle we can take, too. If another person disappears…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> You think they'd be on that Midnight Channel?<br/>
That happened right before Yukiko was kidnapped, too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, it's hard to tell who at first, but what's important is, it's happened before the victims disappeared.<br/>
Kinda like a ransom note.<br/>
We still don't know why that happens, but we'll have to rely on it for now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> The next time it rains…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke was starting to lose his concentration. I'd also like to go on record that this was Yosuke's fault, as with so many things in life.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00104.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Whoa, that's right! Chow time!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, could I try just a little bit of that!? Just one tiny bite!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Hey! Hands off the soba, pal! Go get your own if you want some.<br/>
Rrrngh… Okay, but just one bite, got it?<br/>
&gt; The delicious aroma from the udon bowl is drifting your way…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Do you want to try some?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I swear on my  Persona that I only meant to take one bite.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00111.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> It's soooo gooood… The aroma, the flavor, and the texture all combined… This is perfect!<br/>
&gt; It's too delicious to stop eating…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Aaaack! What the hell are you doing!?<br/>
You ate everything…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> M-My fried tofu…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> I hope you guys understand what this means.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> W-Wait wait wait! Stop! I'm sorry!<br/>
I-I'll buy you steak! It'll be on me!<br/>
Y-You hear me? The very best!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Steak…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> My tofu…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> C'mon, Yukiko. There's steak in it for us now.<br/>
We can get instant noodles anytime we want. Right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Well… as long as it isn't too fatty.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Thanks to Yosuke's quick thinking we had escaped un-brutalized. And I'm sure our karmic balance will be restored by this whole buying steak thing.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00127.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> What wouldn't be too fatty? Fillet? Ooh, fillet sounds nice and expensive!<br/>
Filet, filet, filet mignon!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, you've gotta pony up too! You're just as much to blame!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Fortunately for us, Junes has steak now.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> We're doing our part to spread this town's specialty dish. Plus, we've already got an excellent grill.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> That's just a yakisoba griddle… Oh well, steak is steak.<br/>
It's far from a fillet steak, though…<br/>
Yukiko, are you okay with this? It's not too heavy for you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> I'll eat it… I'm still mad.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> So, back on topic. I wonder what kind of person the culprit is.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> If you focus just on the announcer's case, it seems like a revenge thing. Maybe it was her lover's wife.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> But Misuzu Hiiragi had a solid alibi, didn't she? And it seemed like she was already separated from her husband.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> Really? You know an awful lot about this…<br/>
Okay, what about the second case? Saki-senpai… she found the announcer's body.<br/>
Assuming the same person killed them both, then why target Senpai…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>If we're going in assuming that, there's an obvious suggestion.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00143.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, I think so too.<br/>
Maybe she found a clue or something about the culprit.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> But the killer just threw the announcer into a TV, right?<br/>
I don't think he would've left evidence the police-much less a high school student-would catch.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, exactly…<br/>
<br/>
<i>In case we were ever thinking we might get help from the police, proof of how impossible that was came walking by.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00150.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Adachi.png"/> Ooh, they updated the menu!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Huh? Isn't he that detective?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Adachi.png"/> Hey, you were at Dojima-san's…<br/>
Ahaha… I-I'm not… Oh, wait! Hey, this is great timing after all.<br/>
Dojima-san said that he'll be leaving work on schedule tonight. Could you pass that on to Nanako-chan?<br/>
Yo! I'm Adachi, Dojima-san's gofer… Err, I mean, his partner.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> Are you this busy every day?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Adachi.png"/> Huh? Oh, well, the public seems to be getting a charge out of these cases, but we can't leave it at that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Sorry to butt in, but could it be that the killer targeted Saki-senpai in order to silence her?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Adachi.png"/> U-Ummm, you sure get to the heart of the matter. Yikes… Haha.<br/>
Of course, we're also thinking along those lines. She was killed right after the announcer's body was found.<br/>
If the killer was trying to silence her, there might've been something at the scene only she would have understood.<br/>
Which would mean that the culprit may be someone close to Ms. Konishi.<br/>
<br/>
<i>If Adachi can make detective I weep for this police department.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00164.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Adachi.png"/> W-Wait, were you listening to that!? Crap! Me and my big mouth…<br/>
D-Don't tell anyone I said any of that, or Dojima-san will flay me alive… Relax, kids, the police are on the job.<br/>
See you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> *sigh * You were right, Yosuke. The police are totally useless…<br/>
Augh! My steak's getting cold!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> Could you shut up about the steak for five seconds…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>We let them finish, then headed to talk to Teddie.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00172.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> It's Teddie… Then it wasn't a dream.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Teddie.png"/> Are you feeling better, Yuki-chan?<br/>
I did what you said! I've been a good bear!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Oh, I see. Good boy!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> W-Well, this bear's part of the reason we want to find the culprit.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> I'm one of the group now too. Let's work together, okay?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Teddie.png"/> Yep! I was thinking the same thing!<br/>
That's why I got these ready for you, Yuki-chan!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Oh, so these are what everyone's wearing. Thank you, Teddie.<br/>
You're right… It's just as if the fog doesn't exist…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Hey, tell me something. How come you have so many pairs of glasses?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Teddie.png"/> Excellent question! Guess what? I'm the one who makes them.<br/>
I've lived here for a long time. So I came up with some ways to be comfortable here.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukiko had a pretty good question and I'm not sure I like what the answer implied.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00186.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Teddie.png"/> Oooh, good point. Another great question!<br/>
Listen to this! My eyes themselves are lenses!<br/>
You didn't know?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> Of course not…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Teddie.png"/> Wh-Why are you being so mean? You act like you're not interested!<br/>
I'm a really dexterous bear!<br/>
See how smoothly my fingers move!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't know why it was but damn was that thing Teddie did with his hands creepy and Yosuke was totally justified in what he did after it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00194.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> What am I even looking at!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Teddie.png"/> Ow!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Hm? You dropped something…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Teddie.png"/> Oh, that's a pair I kinda screwed up on.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Oooh…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Oh… Umm… Y-Yukiko?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I really don't know what to say about this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00201.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Damned if she wasn't enjoying herself, though, so I'm not going to rain on her parade.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00202.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-YukikoGlasses.png"/> Ahahaha!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Teddie.png"/> Do you like that one, Yuki-chan?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-YukikoGlasses.png"/> I want to wear this one. It's even got a nose guard!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Ohhh no you don't!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Teddie.png"/> How bear-y unfortunate… That pair doesn't have the right lenses in.<br/>
Guess I should've made an actual pair.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-YukikoGlasses.png"/> Aww, too bad.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Here, Chie. Your turn!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> *sigh * Man… All right, fine…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Snrk… Heehee…!<br/>
Ahaha, ahahahahahaha!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I have to say I never would have pictured Yukiko like this before. I guess she's comfortable enough around us now to be herself.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00214.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> Y-Yukiko-san? Hellooo…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-ChieGlasses.png"/> There goes one of Yukiko's laughing fits… I never though she'd do it when someone besides me was around.<br/>
These stupid glasses are useless for investigating!<br/>
I mean, what the hell's this nose for, anyway!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Teddie.png"/> Nice work, huh? That's what happens when you guys leave me here alone and I get bored!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yosuke.png"/> W-Well, I'm glad that she's in high spirits again… I guess…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Oh Chie, the look on your face… Snrk… Hahaha, it was so funny!<br/>
I-I can't stop… laugh-Heehee! Ohhh, my stomach, ahaha…<br/>
<br/>
<i>When Yukiko was finally laughed out we left and all headed home.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Dojima.png"/> I think I might be able to get the 4th and the 5th off.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Nanako.png"/> Really!?<br/>
…Really?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Dojima.png"/> What, you don't believe me?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Nanako.png"/> …It's always cancelled.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Dojima.png"/> N-Not every year!<br/>
I know you wanted to go to Junes, but… I wouldn't mind going a little further out of the neighborhood.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Nanako.png"/> Really? Can we go on a trip?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Dojima.png"/> Uhh… Well, it might be okay to go on a trip once in a while.<br/>
I'm sure it'll be crowded everywhere, though…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Nanako.png"/> Yaaay! We're going on a trip!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Dojima.png"/> Hm… all right, all right. Then we need to think of someplace to go…<br/>
How about you…? Wanna come along with us?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I wouldn't want to disappoint Nanako.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00238.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Nanako.png"/> Yeah! Let's all go together!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Dojima.png"/> Looks like Nanako wants us all to go.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Nanako.png"/> Let's bring boxed lunches!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Dojima.png"/> Hm? Yeah, good idea. We're always eating side dishes for dinner.<br/>
But I can't cook… And Nanako's not good enough yet to make them by herself…<br/>
……<br/>
Well, it'll work out. That's what we've got this guy for, huh Nanako?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Nanako.png"/> Yaaay, boxed lunches!<br/>
&gt; Nanako is pleased.<br/>
&gt; You've been selected to pack the family's boxed lunches…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's a good thing I know how to cook. I just hope nothing happens to stop Dojima from taking those days off.</i>
