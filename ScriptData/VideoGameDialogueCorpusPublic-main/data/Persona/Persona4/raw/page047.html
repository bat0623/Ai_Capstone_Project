			<b>8/6/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>Not much to say about today, it was raining so I headed down to Aiya to challenge the beef bowl again. Sadly I still lack the strength to defeat it. Not much else to say.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>8/7/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I managed to accomplish that request Margaret gave me earlier today.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Margaret.png"/> This Gdon has Rampage, I see… You have successfully completed the quest…<br/>
Do you know why I asked you to bring me such a beast?<br/>
…Because I wanted you to be aware that even an innocent boy like you can harbor such a dreadful creature inside.<br/>
……<br/>
And… I wanted to ride on it for a bit.<br/>
But this Persona seems too hot for me…<br/>
Can I extinguish its flame?<br/>
*chuckle * I'm kidding. I wouldn't harm your Persona, nor yourself.<br/>
……<br/>
…I think.<br/>
&gt; Margaret is smiling gently…<br/>
&gt; You became more intimate with Margaret…<br/>
<br/>
<i>That was sort of an odd thing for her to say.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Margaret.png"/> Well then… For my next request…<br/>
I would like a Neko Shogun capable of using Bufula. If anyone can do this for me, it's you.<br/>
I eagerly await your return.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I actually already had everything I needed for this in the Compendium as it turned out. I'm still not sure why it's a cat though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Margaret.png"/> Ah, a Neko Shogun with Bufula… You have successfully completed the quest…<br/>
*chuckle * This is a rare Persona… I think I could even beat my master with this.<br/>
Hm… wait a moment.<br/>
The Persona's nose isn't long at all…<br/>
……<br/>
No… There's no way I can win with this Persona.<br/>
It's not easy to surpass the master…<br/>
Regardless, I appreciate your showing me this beautiful Persona.<br/>
One after another, you make my every wish come true… What a gentleman.<br/>
…Hmhm.<br/>
&gt; Margaret is smiling gently…<br/>
&gt; You became a little more intimate with Margaret…<br/>
<br/>
<i>So wait Igor's power comes from his nose? Is that what she's saying?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Margaret.png"/> Well then… For my next request…<br/>
Bring me a Black Frost that knows Auto-Sukukaja… If anyone can do this for me, it's you.<br/>
I eagerly await your return.<br/>
<br/>
<i>That was a little bit harder to achieve, I need to think through how to make that happen. After I left the Velvet Room, I ran into Yosuke. His shift had just ended and he wanted to talk to me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Can I talk to you for a minute? There's something I want to say…<br/>
&gt; Yosuke seems tormented…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> I see. Thanks, man…<br/>
&gt; Yosuke looks happy.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed to the riverbed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Somewhere deep down… I didn't trust you.<br/>
No, it's more like… I was jealous of you.<br/>
I thought you were like me.<br/>
Coming from the city to the countryside, I thought you'd be bored out of your mind here.<br/>
But as soon as you got here, you called your Persona… Became our leader, gathered people… You're a hero.<br/>
I like you for that, and I'm proud of you… But I guess I was jealous at the same time.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Souji.png"/> It can't be helped.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> You get jealous of people, too…?<br/>
Haha, I can't picture it…<br/>
…When I called you "special," I thought some more about it.<br/>
I think out of everyone, I wanted to be acknowledged by you the most…<br/>
So… Souji.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I have to say Yosuke surprised me here.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Give me a good one. Knock out all this crap inside of me.<br/>
I want to be equal with you. I want us to stand shoulder-to-shoulder.<br/>
So c'mon…<br/>
&gt; Will hitting Yosuke make you and him equal…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I won't hit a man that's not trying to hit me back.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Huh…? B-But I don't have a reason to hit you…<br/>
……<br/>
I got it now. If we're "equal," then… I guess you're right.<br/>
Okay, here I come! Take your best shot!<br/>
&gt; You brawled it out with Yosuke…<br/>
<br/>
<i>You know that thing in like games or whatever where two people KO each other at the same time?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Ugh…<br/>
Your punches are brutal… I was seeing stars there for a second…<br/>
But thanks, man… I don't know how to say it, but…<br/>
…That sure beat words.<br/>
&gt; Yosuke's face is peaceful…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> You can have this.<br/>
&gt; You obtained Buddy's Bandage.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> If you start bleeding, put that on. Y'know… We should fight more often.<br/>
Phew… The sky's so high up.<br/>
Is Saki-senpai watching us…? Is she smiling at us?<br/>
Senpai… I'm going to live. Without lying to myself, without deceiving myself…<br/>
Days like today, days like before when I did nothing… They're all important days…<br/>
They're all days you didn't live to see…<br/>
I'm going to live them here.<br/>
&gt; Yosuke is smiling gently…<br/>
<br/>
<i>That was when things got crazy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00091.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>His Persona transformed into Susano-o, who even I know is a god of storms.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00092.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Jiraiya has transfigured into Susano-o!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> This… is my power…?<br/>
The power to protect what's dear to me, huh… Heheh, just what I wanted.<br/>
Let's keep at it, so we can live every day with a smile… Leader.<br/>
&gt; You can feel Yosuke's warm trust…<br/>
&gt; You feel a tight bond between you and Yosuke…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And I myself felt a great power too.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>It seemed I'd once again reached the resolution of a social link. I went and looked up Mada, he's some kind of demon from India.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Well… We're all counting on ya, Souji!<br/>
&gt; You spent a long while with Yosuke…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Not much else to report for today.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>8/8/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ai called me up again earlier today.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00108.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Ai.png"/> Let's go to Junes today.<br/>
Don't be late.<br/>
&gt; You decided to go out with Ai.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sure beat going back to Okina again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00115.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Ai.png"/> No one except starch junkies would order that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Souji.png"/> I know you want it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Ai.png"/> H-How'd you know…!? You better not tell anyone!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Teddie.png"/> Woooow, Sensei!<br/>
I'm impressed… You scored a hot girl…<br/>
Let me in on the secret!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Ai.png"/> "Teddie"…?<br/>
You don't look like a bear.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Teddie.png"/> Nooooo!!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Back to work, Teddie!<br/>
Huh? Souji and Ai-san?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Ai.png"/> Hi.<br/>
You know your store offers nothing but carbs? I need some salad.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> We have a salad bar!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Ai.png"/> No way! It's all soggy!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Teddie.png"/> Wow, her temper surpasses even Rise-chan's…<br/>
But I love it! I want to see even more!<br/>
&gt; It promises to be an entertaining day.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Every day each and every one of us regrets that Teddie was introduced to the concept of 'scoring' by Yukiko's shadow by the way. Just gonna throw that out there.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>8/9/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Well, I managed to find Yukiko. She doesn't really seem upset about anything, maybe I was just being dumb earlier. Oh, and Nanako had a bit of a problem she needed help with.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00143.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Nanako looks like she's about to cry…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I told her I wouldn't, of course.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00145.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Nanako.png"/> O-Okay…<br/>
&gt; Nanako nods and begins talking…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Nanako.png"/> They handed this out at school.<br/>
They said to give it to our parents…<br/>
&gt; The paper Nanako gave you has the following written on it:<br/>
&gt; "Parent Survey Regarding Scheduling Of Parent-Teacher Interviews"<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Nanako.png"/> They said to have our parents write down when they can visit the school…<br/>
……<br/>
But Dad's always working, so…<br/>
He can't come, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm sure he will.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00156.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Nanako.png"/> Really?<br/>
Thanks, big bro!<br/>
&gt; Nanako looks relieved…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Nanako.png"/> …I'll give this to Dad.<br/>
I'll ask him to come…<br/>
I'm glad I asked you!<br/>
&gt; You can feel Nanako's trust for you.<br/>
&gt; You feel that your relationship with Nanako has grown deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>She just needs to trust that Dojima will be there.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00165.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Nanako.png"/> He'll come, right?<br/>
…Since he's my "real" Dad.<br/>
Big bro, did you have "Parent-Teacher Interviews" too?<br/>
Were you nervous?<br/>
&gt; You talked about different things with Nanako…<br/>
&gt; It's getting late, so you put Nanako to bed and went to your own room.<br/>
<br/>
<b>8/10/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Kou and Daisuke came over for a while today.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00181.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You feel a little uneasy about having three guys in your room…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Kou.png"/> Your room's… kinda weird…<br/>
Not too spacious, and yet not too cramped… Not too dark, either…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Daisuke.png"/> Hey, don't bitch about other people's rooms.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Kou.png"/> Wh-What? I wasn't bitching…<br/>
…Anyway, looks like you're a little short on stuff to read. Why don't you take this?<br/>
Tadaaa! "The O-Cha Way"… Want it?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Always a sucker for free stuff.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00189.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Kou.png"/> I'm sure you'll understand it. It's written to teach tea ceremony to foreigners.<br/>
…It was too complex for Daisuke, but that's not saying much. Haha.<br/>
&gt; Obtained The O-Cha Way.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Kou.png"/> He gave it back to me like a day after he borrowed it…<br/>
Now I can finally stop lugging that stupid thing around.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Nanako.png"/> Do we have guests, big bro?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Kou.png"/> Oh, is she your sister, Souji?<br/>
We should all play something.<br/>
Don't you get lonely when your big brother doesn't play with you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Nanako.png"/> …No, I'm fine!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Daisuke.png"/> Alright, then let's do your homework. Kou would LOVE to help you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Kou.png"/> I would!?<br/>
&gt; You've had an exciting day…<br/>
&gt; You spend some precious moments with your friends.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; Daisuke and Kou left your house before it got dark.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still a lot of summer left, and no news. The festival is coming up, though. That's going to be fun.</i>
