			<b>7/30/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>I still can't believe it's all over. Yosuke was off today, we went up to that big hill overlooking Inaba.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Yosuke brought you here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> …I hated this place when I first came to Inaba. You can tell how small the town is from up here.<br/>
But looking at it now… It's a nice town.<br/>
……<br/>
&gt; Yosuke is smiling sadly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> Cheer up.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> If it were only that easy.<br/>
&gt; Yosuke has a self-mocking smirk on his face…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I want to tell Saki-senpai something.<br/>
That what's important… isn't where you are.<br/>
This town I hated so much? Now, I love it.<br/>
There's still nothing here, but I have family and friends… and you.<br/>
The important things are never far off… They're all around you.<br/>
&gt; Yosuke seems a bit embarrassed…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I always wanted to be "special."<br/>
I thought my life'd finally have meaning if I was "special" to someone.<br/>
That's why I was really excited when I got my Persona.<br/>
But I really didn't need it… It's not what you have or what you can do…<br/>
Just being born, living your life… Before you know it, you're already special to someone.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke was getting pretty deep.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah… Like you… You're special to me, you know?<br/>
&gt; Yosuke is rubbing his nose…<br/>
&gt; You can feel Yosuke's warm trust…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Yosuke has grown deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm surprised at how tough Yosuke's gotten.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Alright, let's see if we can find everyone's house from here!<br/>
There's Junes, and that's the main street, so… My house is there, the one with that funky roof.<br/>
Meaning  yours is…<br/>
&gt; You spent a long while with Yosuke…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Despite what he was saying last time, Yosuke's definitely changed quite a lot.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>7/31/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I ran into Rise outside Marukyu, she wanted to head down to Souzai Daigaku.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You came at Rise's earnest request…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Rise.png"/> I can't take another bite. My stomach's full…<br/>
But that really hit the spot! I've been wanting to come here.<br/>
But it's a little embarrassing to show up alone, you know?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> You don't eat out?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Rise.png"/> Nope!<br/>
If someone snapped a photo of me doing that, I'd hear it from my agency.<br/>
The last time I ate out was at a festival when I was still a little kid.<br/>
Back then, it was me and my family… It was fun.<br/>
&gt; Rise is smiling nostalgically…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Rise.png"/> To tell you the truth, I've wanted to do this since I was a child.<br/>
My parents were actually pretty strict.<br/>
I didn't really have many friends.<br/>
Though I guess that couldn't be helped, since I hardly ever showed up for school.<br/>
……<br/>
Er, that's enough talk about that! What a depressing subject, huh?<br/>
Let's talk about something fun. After all, I don't want to waste the time we have together!<br/>
It's so great that I came to this town and met you.<br/>
Really, I'm serious!<br/>
&gt; Rise smiles naturally…<br/>
&gt; You feel you relationship with Rise has grown deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>You never really think about how lonely it must be to be a celebrity.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Rise.png"/> Sooo, why don't I start by asking what kind of girl you like?<br/>
&gt; You dealt with Rise's barrage of questions until it became dark, then went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't think she's quite used to real life yet.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>8/1/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>So I learned today how cool Yukiko can be sometimes.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Yukiko seems embarrassed for some reason…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> Uh… Umm.<br/>
Do you remember Kasai-san, the waitress? She seems to have told everyone about you…<br/>
Now, they're saying I sh-should bring you home…<br/>
Adults are so quick to poke fun at me… It's such a hassle, isn't it…?<br/>
B-But of course my family runs an inn, so guests come by all the time…<br/>
Maybe next time, you can just come in…<br/>
<b>Middle-Aged Man:</b> Oh, Yuki-chan!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> Oh, the deputy mayor.<br/>
<b>Deputy Mayor:</b> The people at the inn seemed very busy. Is something going on?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> Huh…?<br/>
Oh no! Today was the interview for the travel show!<br/>
<b>Deputy Mayor:</b> On TV? That's great! You'll try and make Inaba look inviting, won't you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> I'm sorry, I have to go.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was surprised after what happened last time a TV crew had come by.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00085.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> Uh-huh. It's for a travel show.<br/>
It looks like a serious show, and we agreed to it because my mother and I won't be filmed.<br/>
But they need me to help clean, so I have to go now.<br/>
&gt; Yukiko looks apologetic…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> Goodb-<br/>
<b>Kasai:</b> There you are, Yuki-chan!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> Kasai-san? What's wrong?<br/>
<b>Kasai:</b> That TV crew came, but don't go to the inn!<br/>
It was a trick! It's those people from that "news of the weird" show!<br/>
And I think they're looking for you! So stay put, you got that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> Huh… O-Okay, but…<br/>
<b>Man's Voice:</b> There you are.<br/>
No use in hiding, future manager of the cursed inn.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> C-Cursed inn…?<br/>
<b>Shady Reporter:</b> We know all about that murder case. Mayumi Yamano stayed at your place, right?<br/>
And you guys've been hurting what with the drop in visitors, huh?<br/>
So I came up with a great idea!<br/>
"The High-School Manager's Embarrassing Struggle: Renovating the Cursed Inn!"<br/>
How's that grab you? The customers will be pouring in, I tell ya.<br/>
<br/>
<i>What a shithead.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00105.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Shady Reporter:</b> I want you to be the star. When we introduce the hot springs, let us film a little bathing scene, eh?<br/>
"The Modest Manager's Steamy Service!" Our ratings will go through the roof!<br/>
<b>Young Man:</b> That sounds like a great idea!<br/>
<b>Kasai:</b> Listen, you…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> Anyway, please leave. We are not interested in your coverage.<br/>
<b>Shady Reporter:</b> You're refusing? *sigh * Look, kid…<br/>
You don't know the power of television, do you? Well, I can't blame you, living in the countryside.<br/>
We're trying to help you out here. I mean, do you WANT the patrons to dry up?<br/>
If you're gonna be the next manager, I'm trusting you to make the right decision here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> I… won't be… the next manager.<br/>
<b>Shady Reporter:</b> Oh, really? Hmmm… That so?<br/>
Well, you just say the word, and I can hook you up with a better gig than running this dump of an inn.<br/>
You could call yourself the "Former High-School Innkeeper"…<br/>
Heheheh, I'm already liking the sound of that! Why don't you hear me out?<br/>
<b>Kasai:</b> How dare you say that to Yuki-chan…!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukiko was already getting pretty sick of this guy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00121.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Shady Reporter:</b> What the shit…?<br/>
You say your inn has been going for generations, but all that means is, it's crappy and run-down.<br/>
Tradition is so last year. You'd be better off if you did close up shop.<br/>
I've seen the stuff you serve… Small portions, decent service, nothing that stands out.<br/>
If you want customers, you can't just do the same old, same old.<br/>
You guys don't get that, and that's why you suck.<br/>
Your waitresses don't even give any extra service unless you tip 'em, huh?<br/>
Heyyyy… I know!<br/>
Why don't you make all the waitresses young girls, and have 'em do all-day menus?<br/>
Y'know, spread the futon out, then go straight in!<br/>
But anyways, I was saying… Let's give your place a little TV-style publicity.<br/>
Use your head, willya?<br/>
<b>Kasai:</b> ……<br/>
<br/>
<i>And that was when Yukiko absolutely lost her shit.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00135.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> Don't say another word about our inn! Who'd take your stupid ideas seriously!?<br/>
From now on, we refuse ANY coverage from your station!<br/>
<b>Shady Reporter:</b> You… bitch!<br/>
If that's how you wanna play it, I'll plaster those words all over prime time! See how that feels!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> Go ahead, by all means.<br/>
And we'll respond with an official complaint to your sponsors.<br/>
<b>Young Man:</b> Th-This isn't sounding good, sir.<br/>
<b>Shady Reporter:</b> …Tch!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> I said some incredible things…<br/>
<b>Kasai:</b> …Haha.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> Hahaha…<br/>
<b>Kasai:</b> Oh, I should contact the inn. I'll see you later!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> I just… kind of lost it when he was insulting everyone.<br/>
W-Was I scary?<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was one of the most awesome things I've ever seen honestly.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00150.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> R-Really? Thank goodness…<br/>
&gt; Yukiko seems relieved…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> ……<br/>
There was a time not long ago when I thought, "It'd be better off if it closed," but it's like my home…<br/>
It's where everyone in my world is…<br/>
I can't let it close…<br/>
&gt; It seems Yukiko is starting to face her true feelings…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Yukiko has grown yet deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>As I was thinking earlier, she was never really serious about leaving.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00159.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> Hey… Can you stay here just a little longer…?<br/>
My heart's still racing…<br/>
Please…<br/>
&gt; You stayed with Yukiko for a while and walker her to the inn.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm glad she's started to realize what she really wants.</i>
