<br/>
&gt; This…<br/>
&gt; It seems that you've come to the Velvet Room in your dreams again…<br/>
&gt; But something is different this time… You don't see Igor or Margaret…<br/>
&gt; Teddie is sitting here, not noticing your presence…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> Where… am I…?<br/>
Sensei? Why are you here…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>How do I answer a question that I'm asking myself every time I show up in this place?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> I see… How mysterious…<br/>
There are so many things I don't know about.<br/>
But I did realize something…<br/>
I've been thinking all this time… about who I really am.<br/>
But I couldn't find the answer… I was "no one" from the start…<br/>
Humans live in the other world, and Shadows live in this world…<br/>
From the beginning… that's all there was to it.<br/>
I was just a Shadow in that world…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was concerned with what Teddie was saying, but I was more concerned that he come home.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> You're always so kind, Sensei…<br/>
I figured something out…<br/>
That day at the hospital, I realized that I really can't do anything.<br/>
As soon as I thought that, I lost consciousness… Then when I woke up, I was inside the fog.<br/>
Shadows can't stay in the human world… They aren't allowed.<br/>
I walked and walked, but there was nothing all around me…<br/>
Just when I started thinking that I couldn't go anywhere, I heard the noise of a car…<br/>
And then I was here…<br/>
I remember lots of things now…<br/>
My world is a place shaped by human thoughts…<br/>
One day, a Shadow living in that world awakened to human emotions.<br/>
But humans and Shadows are completely different entities…<br/>
So he made himself forget that he was a Shadow…<br/>
He wanted to forget…<br/>
He wanted people to like him…<br/>
And that's how he came to look like this…<br/>
I really am stupid…<br/>
What the other Teddie said before… In the end, it was all true.<br/>
No matter how much I searched for myself, I have no self…<br/>
There was no me to begin with…<br/>
<br/>
<i>How could Teddie have been the same as the Shadows we've been fighting?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> It would've been better if I had never remembered, but I did…<br/>
I'll… probably turn back into a regular Shadow soon…<br/>
Oh yeah, Sensei.<br/>
One day, when you meet Nana-chan in heaven… Apologize for me…<br/>
Tell her… I'm sorry I couldn't do anything…<br/>
Tell her I'm really sorry…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Even if he was, though, he needed to know the truth.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> Huh…? R-Really!?<br/>
&gt; You told Teddie about how Nanako came through.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> Nana-chan's…<br/>
Wow… That's wonderful…<br/>
I'm so glad…<br/>
Glad that I could at least hear that…<br/>
Heehee… My heart feels so much lighter now… I'm starting to feel sleepy…<br/>
What a strange place… It feels so soothing…<br/>
It's not like my world… Something just feels so nostalgic about this place…<br/>
Could this be your dream world, Sensei…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>That's probably as good a description as Igor's ever given me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> Aha…<br/>
But… I wonder why I met you here…<br/>
What am I supposed to do now…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Souji.png"/> Let's move on together.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> But… I don't know what to look for or how to find it…<br/>
No matter how hard I think, there's too many things my little brain can't understand…<br/>
But I do understand one thing now… I'm glad that I met you, Sensei.<br/>
&gt; You can sense Teddie's pure and deep gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was already getting even more worried about him.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I just had to trust that Teddie would come to his senses and return.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> But I have to get going…<br/>
This is your place… It doesn't seem like somewhere that I'd be allowed to stay…<br/>
Goodbye… Sensei…<br/>
<br/>
<i>The world flashed, and the Velvet Room's familiar inhabitants were revealed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Igor.png"/> Hmm… It seems the words in your memory weren't the only things you summoned here.<br/>
This is a room for guests who have an ego that can be nurtured…<br/>
Shadows-mere fragments broken off from the ego-have no place here.<br/>
The water's strength has moved a single stone that had stopped, returning it once again into the flow…<br/>
*chuckle * Very interesting.<br/>
&gt; Igor has a meaningful smile on his face…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Igor.png"/> Well, now… It's about time we departed once again.<br/>
This vehicle is still on its journey… There is no reason to tarry here for long.<br/>
…Margaret?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Margaret.png"/> We're ready to go. Let us depart.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Igor.png"/> *chuckle * You are every inch the guest I had anticipated.<br/>
Now, it's time for you to return.<br/>
*chuckle * I am even more intrigued now as to where this is all headed.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Margaret.png"/> We'll be waiting for your next visit.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I woke up, and headed down to Junes to meet up with the others.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yosuke.png"/> No, and no one's seen him either.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Rise.png"/> Ooh, that annoying little furball! Just when we're at a turning point in the case, too!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Naoto.png"/> We have no choice. Let's pursue Adachi for now.<br/>
<br/>
<i>The fog in the TV world was thicker than ever, and we couldn't find Adachi.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Rise.png"/> What the…? There's this malicious aura everywhere… It feels completely different from the last time I was here…<br/>
I think we'd better hurry.<br/>
Give me a sec to try finding Adachi.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yosuke.png"/> Does this mean both this world and ours are getting messed up?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yukiko.png"/> Our glasses work on the fog on the other side. It can't be normal…<br/>
And I heard more people are falling ill because of the fog.<br/>
I wonder what's going to happen.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Rise.png"/> I sense him! Adachi's definitely in here!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yosuke.png"/> Are you serious!? Which way!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Rise.png"/> Hold on…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Naoto.png"/> So he did come to this side…<br/>
Well, that settles it. There's virtually no doubt remaining that he's the true culprit.<br/>
Once we capture him, solving the mystery of this world and the rest of the case can't be far behind.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Chie.png"/> Then… maybe we'll find out where Teddie came from, too.<br/>
Man, where is that bear, anyway…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Rise.png"/> Well… I can say for sure he's not here.<br/>
And I know Adachi is here, but I can't track him down myself…<br/>
Gee, Ted! Why aren't you here when we need you most!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Meanwhile…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00109.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> ……<br/>
I see…<br/>
I… came back…<br/>
But it really doesn't matter... I'm completely useless…<br/>
Nana-chan… I'm so sorry…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Nanako.png"/> Teddie…?<br/>
It is you… Teddie…<br/>
I heard… your voice…<br/>
You said… hang in there…<br/>
I heard… my big bro… and everyone else, too…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> N-Nana-chan!?<br/>
Hold on, I'll get the doctor!<br/>
<b>Doctor:</b> It seems she's asleep again…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> U-Um, Nana-chan told me that she heard my voice…<br/>
She heard me say, "hang in there"…<br/>
<b>Doctor:</b> It could be that her frankly miraculous recovery was because everyone's voices reached her.<br/>
Even unconscious people are capable of hearing other's voices.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00127.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> Everyone…<br/>
<b>Doctor:</b> In any case, there are too many things we don't understand about her condition and what caused it…<br/>
We're doing our best, but it's difficult when everything about her illness is a total unknown.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> Unknown…<br/>
<b>Doctor:</b> Well, if anything happens, please send for me…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> If I'm an unknown being, then the way I can change is unknown, too…<br/>
So all I have to do… is make them not-unknown.<br/>
Nana-chan's doing her best… Sensei and the others are probably fighting now too…<br/>
I…<br/>
I'm just a Shadow, but Nana-chan cheered up when she heard my voice…<br/>
So what if I'm just a Shadow…!? There must be something I can do!<br/>
I can't just give up thinking about things…<br/>
That's why I came back here. Right, Nana-chan…?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Kinotki-Douji has transfigured into Kamui!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> Right! I need to get back to the others!<br/>
Hang in there, Nana-chan. I'll be back soon!<br/>
<br/>
<i>No matter how hard Rise tried, she just couldn't seem to find Adachi.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Chie.png"/> Rise-chan…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Rise.png"/> If only Teddie was with us…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Kanji.png"/> Didn't he say his nose is practically useless now? Could he even help us find that bastard?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Rise.png"/> Haha, nope. He'd be no help at all.<br/>
But he was always there to support me whenever…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Chie.png"/> That bear's a loudmouth, but he's nice to have around. He's always so full of energy…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Naoto.png"/> He's lighthearted, and always optimistic…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Rise's strength was starting to give out, and we had to stop for the day.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00154.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Rise.png"/> The fog's so dense… It's hard to see through it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Chie.png"/> Why don't we call it a day? It won't do us any good if you collapse.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Naoto.png"/> I agree. If Rise-san became fatigued, even if we found Adachi, our capacity in battle would be reduced.<br/>
Moreover, it's almost nighttime… We should return to our world for the present.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed back out to Junes, feeling defeated.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00159.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Rise.png"/> I know he's in there, too…<br/>
What's wrong with me…? My powers are completely useless…!<br/>
<br/>
<i>But it's always darkest before the dawn.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00162.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yosuke.png"/> Y-Y-You little… Where the hell were you!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> I-I'm sorry…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Rise.png"/> You idiot! Bad bear! Bad!<br/>
You're so late! Who do you think you are!?<br/>
*sob *<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> U-Um, R-Rise-chan…<br/>
Are you faking?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Rise.png"/> No, stupid!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> S-Sorry…!<br/>
I want to help you all again.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Kanji.png"/> You know how much trouble you caused, y'dumb bear!? Where the hell were you!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> I'm sorry…<br/>
I figured out a lot of things… Stuff about me… and that world.<br/>
I wanted to tell you all…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Teddie laid out all the things he'd told me in the Velvet Room to the group.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00177.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; That he was only a Shadow…<br/>
&gt; And that though he was at his wit's end, he was able to come back to your world…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Chie.png"/> A Shadow…? You mean you're one of those things we've been fighting?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> Yup… just like the ones you all know about.<br/>
Shadows are suppressed human thoughts given form…<br/>
Everyone has them inside.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yosuke.png"/> Wait… You say you're a Shadow, but you didn't attack us.<br/>
And you kept telling us from the start that you wanted to bring peace and quiet back to that world, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> But in the end… I was just an ordinary Shadow. Nothing special about me at all.<br/>
I did everything I could until now to try and make my world peaceful…<br/>
But instead, the weird fog started seeping out into this world too…<br/>
I'm sorry… I'm really sorry. If I really was special, then maybe…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yosuke.png"/> It's no big deal.<br/>
I mean, we weren't expecting much from you in the first place.<br/>
And about you being a Shadow, we pretty much figured you were something like that anyway.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> Huh…?<br/>
Wh-What're you saying!?<br/>
Here I am, pouring my heart out to you, and you say you thought I was something like that anyway!?<br/>
No normal person would think such a pretty bear could really be a Shadow!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Teddie was more worried about it than we were I think.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00197.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Naoto.png"/> It's true that you may have been born that way.<br/>
But you now possess the power of Persona.<br/>
A Shadow is suppressed power… Once controlled by the ego, it becomes a Persona…<br/>
Doesn't it follow, then, that you must have developed an ego?<br/>
Whether the ego masters its Shadow, or the Shadow awakens to its ego…<br/>
The only difference I see is the order in which the process occurred.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Chie.png"/> Oh! Teddie's practically human, then.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> I-I'm… the same as humans…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yosuke.png"/> You keep trying to figure out who you are, just like all of us here.<br/>
You can't do much on your own… You really aren't that special… See? What's so different between you and us?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> *sniff *<br/>
Raaaaaaaaawr!<br/>
Th-Tha… Thank you…<br/>
I-I'm so glad… I met you guys…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yosuke.png"/> the rest of us were pretty much a group of misfits to begin with too, right?<br/>
You fit right in, man.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke's started talking in the plural, it worries me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00215.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Rise.png"/> Isn't that just you, Senpai?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yosuke.png"/> Hey… That's not something a detective would say… Or an idol, either!<br/>
Geez… Stop crying, will ya? Now's not the time for that.<br/>
While you were gone, we figured out who murdered the announcer and Senpai…<br/>
It was Adachi.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> Huh!?<br/>
Adachi!? That total goofball!?<br/>
Whoa… I didn't notice at all. Looks like I'm pretty blind to that sorta thing…<br/>
Mmm…<br/>
But you all know him… If you can't find someone like that, I don't think I can help you…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yosuke.png"/> Like I said, we're not expecting much from ya.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Kanji.png"/> The main thing is, it's hard to get pumped about this without someone nice 'n fuzzy around.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Rise.png"/> Yeah, what Kanji said.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> O-Okay…<br/>
Thanks, guys…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yosuke.png"/> Alright, now that the band's back together, let's take it from the top, starting tomorrow!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> It's been a while, but I'll do my best to look for him too! Leave it to Fuzzy!<br/>
&gt; You've taken another step toward the truth…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Now there's no way we can lose.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-P4-00234.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>We're going back in tomorrow, we'll find Adachi for sure.</i><br/>
