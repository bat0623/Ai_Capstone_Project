<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> "dont rescue anymore"…<br/>
Is this a warning?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> No punctuation or capitalization… What a cliché.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> Ain't this just a prank? The kinda stuff that only happens in the movies?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> Did you show this to your uncle?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Souji.png"/> I don't plan to.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Senpai… Dojima-san is trustworthy, but it may be best to keep this to ourselves.<br/>
He will ask why you received such a letter, and if he were to put you under surveillance, our hands would be tied.<br/>
If this letter is real, what's most important isn't what it says…<br/>
It's the fact that it was delivered to the Dojima residence, addressed directly to you.<br/>
This means the culprit knows in great detail who has been interfering with his crimes…<br/>
And of all of us, he chose to deliver his message to the Dojima residence, home of a police detective.<br/>
I'd have this letter checked at a crime lab if I could… But even then, I doubt they'd find anything.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Naoto summarized her point pretty well at that point.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> So it's useless to tell the police… In fact, that would make things worse.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> Cross your fingers it's just a prank…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Yukiko.png"/> I think the chances of that are slim… This message is too specific, too perfect to be a prank.<br/>
But how could the killer know so much about us?<br/>
Could he be watching us from somewhere…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> Teddie's been saying for a while that when we're over there, he senses someone watching us…<br/>
Wait… Every time we went to the other side to rescue someone, did we end up on the Midnight Channel ourselves…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> I-I dunno… It seems like no one else knows what we're doing.<br/>
I haven't heard any rumors about us at school. Even the people who I know check that channel haven't said anything…<br/>
The only gossip I heard was about the people who disappeared.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> I see… Come to think of it, how the Midnight Channel works is still a mystery…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Let's put aside for now the matter of what that world truly is. There's too little data to go on.<br/>
For now, we need to keep in mind that the culprit knows who we are…<br/>
As long as we're all aware of that, it will be enough for now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah… Guess there's no use thinking about stuff we can't understand.<br/>
Freaking out over speculation is just what the killer wants us to do… Right?<br/>
<br/>
<i>This whole thing could work in our favor, actually.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> …Yeah.<br/>
&gt; You told the others, "We'll have to wait until the situation changes."<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> All right.<br/>
Mind if I change the subject, then?<br/>
The Culture Festival's just around the corner. What's our class doing again?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> Oh yeah, it hasn't been decided yet, huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Yukiko.png"/> I heard we'll be voting on it soon… But aren't they still gathering ideas?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Whoa… I think Yosuke just got hit with a bolt of inspiration…<br/>
Whatever it is, it'll be out there. I'd bet my lunch on it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> Hey Senpai, have you decided who you'll be going around the campus with during the festival?<br/>
My schedule's still wide open, you lucky guy!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Urgh… She just had to say something…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Anyway, after school I was messing around in the shopping district and met a weird guy in a black suit.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Man In Black:</b> ……<br/>
&gt; The man in black is looking at you, as if appraising you…<br/>
<b>Man In Black:</b> Do you know about luminol reactions? What part of the body do you use to test DNA?<br/>
What's the best way to obtain someone's email address? What ten things can you learn from footprints?<br/>
&gt; The man is bombarding you with questions for some reason…<br/>
&gt; With your unmatched Knowledge, you answered every challenge smoothly and easily!<br/>
<b>Man In Black:</b> I see, I see… You are quite an interesting young man.<br/>
Do you know Naoto-sama… Oh, er…<br/>
You know a detective by the name of Naoto Shirogane, correct…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I figured there was no point trying to bullshit this guy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Man In Black:</b> Yes, I know you know him.<br/>
Deliver this to him. He will understand.<br/>
&gt; The man in black gave you a card…<br/>
<b>Man In Black:</b> Good day, then…<br/>
&gt; The man walked briskly away…<br/>
&gt; This smells like a case… You should hand it over to Naoto.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think Naoto had to go home early, though. There was no sign of her around. Instead I went with Rise to get some skewers.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> Heck, maybe our shop should do something like this.<br/>
How about a "ganmo kebab"? Or a "tofu croquette"?<br/>
<b>Middle-Aged Man:</b> Well, if it isn't Rise-chan.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> Ummm, you're the deputy mayor… right? Good afternoon…<br/>
<b>Deputy Mayor:</b> I heard the news! You know, about the upcoming film!<br/>
…Hm? You haven't heard yet?<br/>
You know Kanamin, right? Kanami Mashita!<br/>
They're going to be filming nearby, right? I hope they stop by Inaba, too.<br/>
Oh, I know! Why don't you ask?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> Kanamin…<br/>
…I don't have anything to do with them anymore.<br/>
<b>Deputy Mayor:</b> But wait… How many are coming? We only have small bed-and-breakfasts around here…<br/>
Got it! They can stay at the Amagi Inn!<br/>
Alright, I need to go tell that manager guy I was just talking to!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> ……<br/>
<br/>
<i>Just then Inoue came by. He's a real prick for a nice guy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00083.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> Inoue-san… What do you want today…?<br/>
<b>Inoue:</b> I'm down here scouting film locations, so I thought I'd come see you.<br/>
I wanted to hear your answer one more time, face to face.<br/>
…Are you sure you're not coming back?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> ……<br/>
I…<br/>
I'm not going back…<br/>
……<br/>
<b>Inoue:</b> I see…<br/>
Okay… I understand. Well, now I can focus on my new job.<br/>
I signed up as Kanami Mashita's manager.<br/>
Remember how we were talking about doing that movie? They picked Kanami as your replacement.<br/>
…We're going to sell Kanami.<br/>
I have every confidence she'll be just as popular… no, even MORE popular than Risette.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> I-I see…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I can't imagine why he never said this shit before.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Inoue:</b> ……<br/>
But you had that spark…<br/>
You learned fast, adapted well to new situations, had that smile that could be as strong or weak as you needed…<br/>
And those acting skills of yours! You were like an old pro.<br/>
You could have reached heights most girls could never dream of…<br/>
…That's what I think, anyway.<br/>
So… I just had to hear it from your own mouth.<br/>
Well, then… goodbye.<br/>
Stay healthy, okay?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> ……<br/>
What the heck… That's not fair… After he made me answer…<br/>
He never told me any of that when we were still working together…<br/>
Acting skills…? Of course I have 'em.<br/>
What the heck…? Telling me all that stuff now… It's too late…!<br/>
……<br/>
&gt; It seems Rise is crying…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Bastard had no idea what he did to her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00116.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> There's no reason to cry… There's nothing… to be sad about…<br/>
Nothing…<br/>
Senpai… I… I don't know why I'm crying…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Souji.png"/> Cry all you want.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> Haha… I can't… My eyes will be all swollen tomorrow…<br/>
I… I lost… everything…<br/>
I don't know how… but… I lost everything…<br/>
I'm scared… I'm sad… What's going on…?<br/>
Senpai…<br/>
Please, stay here…<br/>
Stay by… my side…<br/>
Senpai…!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't know that Rise had ever really thought through what she was giving up before.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00130.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> Senpai…<br/>
I have you… I have the others…<br/>
I didn't lose everything…<br/>
There are people who need me, right…?<br/>
&gt; Rise is smiling through her tears…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Rise has grown deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>But Rise… I don't think she really gives up that easily.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00137.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> I'm going home now.<br/>
My head's all messed up…<br/>
I need time to think it all over. About how I feel now…<br/>
I don't want to lose anything more…<br/>
Goodbye, Senpai…<br/>
&gt; You watched Rise walk off and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I know she'll figure out what it is she really wants. And I'll be damned if I let this freak scare me with some stupid letter. That he's resorting to crap like that just means he's afraid, afraid we're closing in. I get the feeling we're closer than ever to bringing him down.</i><br/>
