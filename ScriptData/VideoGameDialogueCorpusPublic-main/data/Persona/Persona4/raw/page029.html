			<b>6/17-18/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>How best to sum up the school campout? In a word, harrowing. It turned out all the trash-picking was the highlight of our time on the mountain. When we were done Yukiko and Chie started making what they said was going to be curry.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Ugh, picking up all that trash was murder on my back…<br/>
I can't believe someone threw away an entire bike. Dammit, litterers should have to deal with their own garbage…<br/>
Anyways, time for dinner! Man, I'm starvin'.<br/>
Dude, the girls cooked just for us!<br/>
Not that I expect much outta Chie, but Yukiko's got the full tradition of the Amagi Inn behind her food!<br/>
You know it's gonna be out of this world!<br/>
<br/>
<i>When he said that I remembered that boxed lunch she made and what they got at Junes and no lie I almost threw up right there.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> H-Hey, what's the matter? Is it okay if I have yours?<br/>
I can't wait to dig in!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Should we… taste this?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Huh? O-Only if you do it first…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Oh man, here it comes!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Uhhh, sorry for the wait. Um…<br/>
We… put a lot of love into it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Whoa, really? That's kinda clichéd, but still awesome!<br/>
Okay then, chow time!<br/>
Urh, agh, aaarghraaaaw!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke choked, sputtered, and fell.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> WHAT THE HELL IS THIS!?<br/>
I mean, what kinda--*cough cough*<br/>
Curry's supposed to be like "really spicy" or "kinda mild"… This just stinks!<br/>
And it's gritty too!<br/>
It's somehow both gritty and slimy… And it's got squishy parts in it…<br/>
It's so frickin' nasty I can't swallow it!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Well, it just didn't mix too well… But it does offer a wide variety of textures…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> It's nauseating!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> C'mon, it's not THAT bad…!<br/>
That's just your opinion!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I'm telling you as a friend… Don't do it. I wouldn't even joke about trying that slop!<br/>
&gt; You're being looked at with expectation…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I earnestly did at least give it a shot.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You lack the Courage to go through with it…<br/>
&gt; You're being looked at with expectation…<br/>
&gt; Pretend to eat and discard it.<br/>
&gt; Chie and Yukiko are staring at you…<br/>
&gt; It doesn't look as though you'll be able to fake it…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; The second you put it in your mouth, you sense that something is wrong…<br/>
&gt; You can tell after one bite that this isn't edible…<br/>
&gt; There's no way you can swallow it…<br/>
<br/>
<i>In my wildest nightmares I'd never envisioned that you could make food taste like that. So yeah, none of us ate.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Sorry…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> *sigh * What're we gonna do? Our group's the only one without food.<br/>
I mean, if was even slightly edible, that'd be one thing… But I'm not taking another bite of this Mystery Food X.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Something smells good…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> H-Hey… Uh, Hanako?<br/>
You… wouldn't happen to have any extra curry left, huh?<br/>
C'mon, give us some! We're begging you! We're starving to death here!<br/>
<br/>
<i>But there was no luck for us that day.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Hanako.png"/> I'm on a diet right now, so this is all that I made. It has to last me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> All that you made…? It's like a bucketful…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> *sigh * I wonder if there's any way we can get something delivered here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> But our cell phones don't get service up here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> And dinnertime's almost over…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Morooka.png"/> Alright, back to your tents! Men's tents are this way, and the girls' tens are that way!<br/>
Come on, people, look alive! Youngsters like yourselves should hurry up and get to bed after they eat!<br/>
It's now time for us teachers to have some boo-I mean, err, off to bed! Lights out!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> You guys are gonna pay for this…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> A-Ahaha… haha.<br/>
…Night.<br/>
<br/>
<i>So we went back to our tent. And I literally mean our tent because it was just me and Yosuke, and Kanji for some reason I wasn't totally clear on.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> And how the hell did you end up here?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> My teach threatened to hold me back a year if I didn't show.<br/>
And the first-year's tent is all quiet, like someone died.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Well, if you were in there with 'em, I'm not surprised…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Is it just you two in this tent?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> The other guys called in sick. Smart move…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> So it's okay if I hang out here?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I didn't have any problem with it at the time.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00077.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Hey, you're a stand-up guy, Senpai.<br/>
Don't worry, I won't make any trouble for you. They won't catch me unless we raise a ruckus.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> *sigh * Alright, alright. You can sleep over there.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Dude, there's a huge rock under there. How'm I supposed to sleep? It's gonna hurt like hell.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Pipe down… Didn't you say you weren't going to make any noise?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Yo Senpai, can't you go just a little further back?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Nope. There's a slope just past here. I'd roll down the hill in my sleep.<br/>
If you don't like it here, go back to the first-year tent.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Hey… wasn't your teacher some guy called King Moron?<br/>
That guy stopped me outside earlier, and he pissed me off so bad I was about to lose it.<br/>
He was going on and on about when I was in middle school, when he doesn't know shit about any of that…<br/>
Not only that, he was bullshitting about how I'll be expelled immediately if I cause trouble… That ain't funny, man.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, that guy's set a speed record for jumping to conclusions…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Check this out, right? I heard it from a guy in my class.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Morooka really does piss me off more and more every day.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00092.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> King Moron was talking about Ms. Yamano and Saki-senpai…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> It was like, "It's no surprise that people who are unfaithful or run away from home meet a bad end…"<br/>
I dunno, maybe he was exaggerating. Everyone seems to hate that son of a bitch Morooka.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Damn, I can just picture him saying that…<br/>
He never shut up about me either when I moved here last year.<br/>
Not that I remember anything he said…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Even if it's only a little true, it still pisses me off… The dickhead's a damn teacher, for god's sake.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Ahhh, don't waste your energy getting pissed at that clown. *munch munch*<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Yeah, you got a point…<br/>
Wait a sec, what are you eating!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Animal crackers.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> What the--!? Those are mine!<br/>
Dammit, I was so pumped about finding the penguin today…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Penguin?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> The secret animal cracker! You were eating them and you didn't know that!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> A-Are you serious? Well, you shoulda said something!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke didn't even share them either, prick.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00110.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Ughhh… This isn't gonna fill me up…<br/>
*sigh * Let's just go to sleep…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> That's all you got to say for yourself after taking my snacks…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>And things managed to get even worse soon after that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00114.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Man, I can't sleep over there, or my back's gonna break.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Oh… Okay.<br/>
Uh… Hey.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Yeah?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> …Why'd you come to this tent?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Huh? I already told you.<br/>
Geez… 's wrong with you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> This is as good a time as any, so… I-I want you to be honest with us.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Uh… okay?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> A-Are you really… you know…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Am I really what…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>God damn Yosuke, he knew this was gonna start shit and his dumb ass couldn't help himself.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00126.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> What--!?<br/>
Wh-Wh-What the hell's that supposed to mean!? I-I already told you guys I'm not like that!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> W-Well then why are you all hot and bothered about it!?<br/>
That's just more suspicious!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Hell no!<br/>
We settled this already, dammit! Right now, I'm… Well… How do I put it…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Oh God, don't train off like that! You're freaking me out!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> I'm trying to tell you that I have no problem being around girls now!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Can you prove it!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> P-Prove it…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> 'Cause if you can't, we're gonna be stuck here all night, half scared to death.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Tch… To hell with this. If that's what you really think of me, then I'm gonna go hit the girls' tent right now!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Huh? Wait, well that's a little extreme! You don't have to go that far!<br/>
They'll expel you if they find you! Don't tell me you forgot! King Moron's got his eye on you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Yeah… like that'd stop a man like me!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Dude's seriously going for it… Hey man, you gotta stop him.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I tried, but damn did Yosuke get under his skin.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00145.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You tried to convince Kanji not to go through with it…<br/>
&gt; But he's not listening!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Y'think I'm gonna put up with this crap!? I'll show you guys!<br/>
To hell with King Moron! No one's stopping Kanji Tatsumi, dammit!<br/>
Raaaaaaahhhhh!!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Uh, hey! Wait!<br/>
What a putz. I declare myself not responsible for anything that happens.<br/>
<br/>
<i>The details of what happened next remain sketchy. Chie and Yukiko weren't exactly forthcoming.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> I can't sleep…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> *sigh * I'm hungry, too.<br/>
I should've eaten a little more of that curry…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> It might've knocked us unconscious…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Sheesh… We can't sleep, we can't walk around…<br/>
I wonder what Teddie's doing right now.<br/>
Being alone all day's pretty rough when you think about it… You know, a while ago he-<br/>
……<br/>
Uuuugh… Aaaargh!<br/>
That does it! Yukiko, we're outta here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Where'd we go, though? I don't think climbing down the mountain is a good idea…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I guess Hanako was snoring. Yukiko muttered something about a "breeder hog" whatever that means.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00166.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> N-Nononononono! Yukiko, NO!<br/>
Ugh… I can't take it anymore…<br/>
Wh-Who's there!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>The story trailed off between this point and when they showed up at our tent.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00171.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> What're you guys doing here!? This is the guys' side!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Let us in!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Don't be ridiculous! If King Moron finds out, we'll all be expelled! Go back to your tent!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> We can't!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Morooka.png"/> Are there any rotten apples out and about!? Any indecent students out there…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> A-Alright, hurry up and get in!<br/>
So, why're you two here?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Well, it's Kanji-kun…<br/>
He's out cold…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> I-I don't know what happened!<br/>
H-He just came in and then, and then… he fainted all of a sudden.<br/>
That's all. Right, Yukiko?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Huh? Y-Yeah.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> So there was no way we could sleep with him lying there, and you know… If we woke him up, he might've made a fuss.<br/>
That's why we left him there.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> What? That makes no sense. He busted into your tent, then suddenly fainted?<br/>
<br/>
<i>All this noise had attracted Morooka, though he seemed pretty out of it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00188.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> It's him! He's right outside!<br/>
H-Hey, turn the light off!<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You can sense King Moron getting closer…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Morooka.png"/> Hey, are you two in there? Answer me!<br/>
<br/>
<i>No point pissing him off even more than he normally is.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00194.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Morooka.png"/> Huh…? Ahhh, so you're in there…<br/>
Is Hanamura already asleep?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yessir! Fast asleep, Sir!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Morooka.png"/> Don't get cute, Hanamura! Shut up and go back to sleep.<br/>
*yaaawwn * Ugh, I think I had one too many. I'm so sleepy…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; It seems that King Moron left…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> *sigh * There goes a couple of years off my lifespan.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> No joke… We were nearly expelled…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, this is you guys' fault!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Wh-What else were we supposed to do!?<br/>
Anyways, we can't leave now. We'll sneak out before the others wake up tomorrow. Is that good enough for you!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> What're you so pissed off for…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> You better not try any funny stuff while we're asleep, is that clear?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> H-Hey, we didn't say you could-<br/>
Dammit, you owe us for this!<br/>
&gt; You set up a barricade inside the tent using everyone's belongings…<br/>
&gt; You spent the night, cramped up in a tight space…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sure enough they snuck out early in the morning, and managed to get Kanji back into our tent somehow. I guess it's a good thing Chie works out so much. We all got together by the river the next morning.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> What's wrong? Got a stomach ache?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> No, it's just… I thought I got pissed and ran out of the tent last night…<br/>
It's so weird… Was it a dream? When I woke up, I was in Yosuke-senpai's tent…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> It-It was a dream. Must've been a dream.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Okay…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Alright, then let's get swimming!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Are you seriously taking a swim? I'll pass… I'm still all stiff.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> What're you guys looking at us for…? If you guys wanna swim, go right ahead.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> You know, you two still owe us.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Huh? Whoa whoa whoa, we're not going in there.<br/>
I mean, we do owe you, but…<br/>
Oh yeah! We don't have swimsuits with us! Man, of all the luck!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Y-Yeah, it really is unfortunate.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, I see how it is.<br/>
We put up with your dinner, we save you from King Moron, and you won't even have some fun with us in the river.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> N-No, it's really too bad. It'd be no problem if I just had a swimsuit. Haha…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Then we discovered what Yosuke had been doing while we were failing to get the right ingredients for curry.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00284.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> They're Junes-brand originals, from our brand-new line of swimwear that just came in for the summer.<br/>
I had a clerk friend of mine choose 'em for me. Pretty swanky, huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Dude, that's just wrong…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Did you have those this whole time…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> C'mon, let's all go swimming!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> What should we do, Yukiko…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> "It'd be no problem if I just had a swimsuit."<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Urgh…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Y'know, we really were looking forward to dinner.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Ngh…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I wonder what would've happened if we didn't help you guys last night…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> We get it already! Sheesh, you never let things go!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Alright! That's more like it!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke certainly is persistent, and it's a good thing he didn't tell them how the thing with Kanji was all his fault.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00246.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> C'mon, let's get in.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke had made some good choices, I'll grant him that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00248.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> S-Stop staring like that!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> H-Hey…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We, uh, should have started to pick up on how this was going about now.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00252.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Wh-Where did that come from!?<br/>
&gt; They both look embarrassed…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Man, this is going even better than I expected.<br/>
Kinda makes up for having to eat that Mystery Food X last night.<br/>
C'mon, you guys gotta admit I chose some good suits.<br/>
Those girls might be childish on the inside, but I bet they're gonna turn into some fine-looking women before too long!<br/>
Don't you think so, Souji?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Okay I'm going to be honest when I say we really did deserve this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00260.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> You guys crossed the line…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> …Definitely.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00263.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>So what I hadn't been counting on is that the Samegawa is ICE COLD up in the mountains.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00264.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Who cares!? You were going in the river anyway!<br/>
They brought this on themselves. Sheesh… Aren't they the worst, Kanji-kun?<br/>
Hey, you've been awful quiet. Are you feeling okay? D-Don't tell me the injuries from yesterday are still…<br/>
…Uhhhh…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yeah I'm pretty sure Chie beat the everloving shit out of him last night.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00269.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Kanji has a nosebleed…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Ewww!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Poor Kanji, reaping what Yosuke sowed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00272.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> That was close…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> What was that for!? I didn't do anything!<br/>
*sneeze *<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> H-Hey! What's gotten into you!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>THEN IT GOT WORSE. SO MUCH WORSE.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-P4-00277.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You hear a man heaving upstream…<br/>
&gt; It seems that King Moron is vomiting further up the river…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> So that's why no one else was here… Good thing we noticed before we went in.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Senpai…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Don't say it…<br/>
&gt; You feel as though a million showers will never make you clean…<br/>
<br/>
<i>So yeah we're never speaking of this day again, and I need to go steel wool all my skin off. All in all a magical time was had by all.</i><br/>
