			<b>9/27/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>Kanji wanted me to come along when he went to see that kid from before, so I agreed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It seems Kanji called the boy here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> Here's the stuff I promised ya.<br/>
N-No complaining, okay…?<br/>
&gt; Kanji handed the boy what appears to be a bunny doll…<br/>
&gt; …It's complete with clothes, a ribbon, a hat and an umbrella.<br/>
&gt; It's… very elaborate.<br/>
<b>Quiet-Looking Boy:</b> Whoa!!<br/>
This is incredible! Where'd you buy it!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> Huh…? Wh-Who cares!?<br/>
<b>Quiet-Looking Boy:</b> But I want one too!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> Oh… Well, I got one for you.<br/>
&gt; Kanji handed the boy another bunny…<br/>
&gt; …It's complete with clothes, shoes, a cap and a soccer ball.<br/>
&gt; It's… very elaborate.<br/>
<b>Quiet-Looking Boy:</b> For me!? Thanks!!<br/>
But where'd you buy it…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> Er…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I had already figured out the only possible answer.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> Er…<br/>
……<br/>
I-I made it…<br/>
<b>Quiet-Looking Boy:</b> You… made this?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> Y-Y'got a problem with that…?<br/>
If ya think it's so creepy, then give it-<br/>
<b>Quiet-Looking Boy:</b> Wow! You're so cool!!<br/>
Hey, can you make me something else!? Mom loves this kind of stuff!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> Huh? S-Sure…<br/>
<b>Quiet-Looking Boy:</b> You promised!<br/>
I'm gonna go give this to Sana-chan! Thanks, Mister!!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> I'm not that old, dammit…<br/>
……<br/>
Hah, he said I'm cool…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kanji certainly does good work.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> Yeah, but it's not like sewing's good for anything…<br/>
&gt; Kanji seems embarrassed…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> But y'know… It ain't a bad feeling.<br/>
"Thanks," huh…?<br/>
Ahhh, it was nothing.<br/>
&gt; Kanji, with his embarrassed smile, looks more mature than usual…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Kanji has grown yet deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean when you're that good at something, you should stick with it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> …This is a great place, huh? The wind is different up here…<br/>
Never noticed before.<br/>
&gt; You talked with Kanji for a while and started back home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm reading a book on men throughout history, it's kinda cool I guess.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>9/28/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Um, today was eventful. You could say that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Kondo:</b> …Oh man, I'm sooo hungry. Did you all eat breakfast?<br/>
I did, but it's already digested! I'm so hungry, even after eating lunch!<br/>
I feel like I haven't eaten in ten years!<br/>
Say, that reminds me. What figure of speech am I using when I say I haven't eaten in ten years?<br/>
…Yosuke! Take a wild guess!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Huh!? A g-guess…? How'd he get to this from breakfast?<br/>
Hey, Souji… Do you know?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Here's an example: Yosuke is a million years behind in English!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Kondo:</b> Good guess, Yosuke! Hyperbole is just a gross exaggeration.<br/>
We use it all the time when we're not even thinking about it to emphasize what we're saying.<br/>
I don't even want to imagine having to go ten years without eating…<br/>
Thanks, Souji. You're awesome!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Daisuke was out in the hall, so I asked him Ai's question.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Daisuke.png"/> …What? Do I have something on my face or something?<br/>
&gt; You told Daisuke that Ai Ebihara wanted to know his type…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Daisuke.png"/> Huh? My type?<br/>
Hmmm… Someone who's a nice person… I guess.<br/>
…Why you gotta ask me things like that!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I reported back to Ai.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00072.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ai.png"/> C-Come with me.<br/>
&gt; Ai looks almost happy…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We went up to the roof, she didn't want to talk about it down there.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00076.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Ai yanked your arm all the way up here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ai.png"/> S-So, did you ask him… what kind of girl he likes?<br/>
&gt; You told Ai about Daisuke's type… "Nice girls."<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ai.png"/> …"Nice"?<br/>
He didn't say anything about being cute? Not even like, "a beautiful woman" or anything like that?<br/>
&gt; Ai looks almost panicked…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ai.png"/> B-But, every guy wants to be with a pretty girl, right? It's the good-looking girls who find love, isn't it!?<br/>
Forget this, I'm tired of beating around the bush. Just go ask him if he's got a crush on anyone.<br/>
What are you waiting for!? Go!<br/>
&gt; …You don't appear to have a choice.<br/>
&gt; You decided to check downstairs…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yeah, you try saying know to that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You asked Daisuke if he has a crush on anyone in particular…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Daisuke.png"/> Huh!? What's gotten into you?<br/>
Nah… there isn't anyone.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You asked if he had any interest in Ai.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Daisuke.png"/> Ai…? Like our manager, Ai?<br/>
Not interested.<br/>
We done playing 20 questions? Haha. See ya later.<br/>
&gt; You feel the presence of someone watching you…<br/>
&gt; …It seems Ai was eavesdropping!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I ran up to the roof after her, and it was a good thing I did. Ai was standing on the ledge!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ai.png"/> He doesn't like me! He's not interested in the slightest!<br/>
I…! I…<br/>
&gt; Ai has lost her composure…<br/>
&gt; You need to calm her down before it gets any worse…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ai.png"/> Guys like pretty girls, don't they!?<br/>
I'm pretty now! And I had to work hard to become this way!<br/>
But if I can't be loved, then… Then what's the point!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Souji.png"/> I'll hear you out.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ai.png"/> *sniff * *sob *<br/>
<br/>
<i>Ai came down from the ledge, thankfully.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00109.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ai.png"/> I used to be fat and clumsy… My family was poor, and everyone at school bullied me all the time.<br/>
The used to surround me and say I was gross, or they called me names like "Piggy-hara"…<br/>
The boy I had a crush on even told me not to look at him, because I'd "give him my germs."<br/>
Those awful memories still haunt me in my nightmares…<br/>
About the time I entered middle school, my family came into their money.<br/>
Everyone got so jealous of us that we ran away… and moved here.<br/>
I knew this was my chance to start over… It was time to show them all…<br/>
I dieted, got into shape, and read every fashion or women's magazine I could get my hands on.<br/>
I studied them like they were textbooks and learned all the secrets-everything from attracting guys to smiling better.<br/>
But…<br/>
Ahaha…<br/>
Looks like… it was all for nothing.<br/>
I couldn't be loved unless I became pretty, and now that I am, I still can't have it.<br/>
I guess I'm doomed. I'll never be loved, will I?<br/>
It's not like I have any other redeeming qualities…<br/>
<br/>
<i>She's not being fair to herself, she's really a good person.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00126.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ai.png"/> You're… so nice to me.<br/>
I should've fallen in love with you…<br/>
Haha, just kidding…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Souji.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ai.png"/> Hey… Why don't you and I just go out?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Souji.png"/> Are you sure about that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ai.png"/> …You're a weird guy.<br/>
You're right, I'm sorry… I'm still… a little confused.<br/>
&gt; Ai smiles sadly…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Ai has grown deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's strange how different someone can be than your first impression of them.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00137.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ai.png"/> I'm going home now…<br/>
……<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
&gt; Ai walked down the stairs with heavy footsteps…<br/>
&gt; …You decided to go home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think Ai's going to be okay, I suspect she's a lot tougher than she seems.</i>
