<br/>
<i>The fog was drawing in…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Is this… where you will fall…? Before a powerful enemy…?<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; ……?<br/>
&gt; You hear… someone's voice…<br/>
<br/>
<i>But even in the fog of lies some truths shine through.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Margaret.png"/> Get up. You are not someone allowed to fall here.<br/>
You must know already…<br/>
The true nature of bonds… What bonds give you…<br/>
Here, listen closely…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I remembered how hard Dojima fought for Nanako.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Dojima.png"/> …You taught me what a family truly is.<br/>
I had my hands full with Nanako when you came rolling in… Haha, I wasn't sure what to do…<br/>
But then again…<br/>
I can get back up as many times as I need to with you two with me… However painful it gets, I'll just grit my teeth…<br/>
I'll get up as many times as I have to for you two… A father can be pretty stupid that way, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I remembered that time me and Yosuke had a fight.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Yosuke.png"/> Everything inside me changed after I met you…<br/>
I'm… glad we met. I wouldn't have made it this far if I hadn't done it alongside you…<br/>
You can't let it end this way, right?<br/>
You can keep going… Right, partner?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I remembered when Chie and I stopped those bullies.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chie.png"/> I'm such a stubborn, two-faced coward…<br/>
But you understood me… That's why… I can become as strong as I need to be…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I remembered when Yukiko resolved to strive for the future she really wanted.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Yukiko.png"/> I'll give you our strength… You're our last hope…<br/>
Please… Get back up, just once more.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I remembered how Kanji helped that kid when nobody else could have.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Kanji.png"/> You ain't like that, Senpai… You're not the kinda guy who can let it drop like this…<br/>
That ain't the Souji-senpai I look up to…<br/>
Get back up… Just one more time… Let me protect you…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I remembered when Rise decided that she didn't need to choose just one way to be.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Rise.png"/> I'm glad I came to this town… When I think back on all the fun I had with you…<br/>
Senpai… Please stand up just one more time. We'll be your strength…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I remembered the moment I threw myself into danger without hesitation for Naoto.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> You… gave me a reason to stay just as I am.<br/>
For someone like you to leave me in the dark halfway like this…<br/>
…Souji-san. Please stand up, just once more…<br/>
Let's fight this together. Never fear… We're always together.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I remembered the fox and its kids. Would even they disappear in the fog?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The fox's cry is weak…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I remembered the day we told Daisuke he didn't have to go it alone.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Daisuke.png"/> C'mon, you're not alone. Just like me and Kou weren't.<br/>
I won't let you do this alone…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I remembered when Ai nearly killed herself.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Ai.png"/> Don't you care that I won't be able to take another step forward if you disappear…?<br/>
I… couldn't stick by someone who'd do that to me…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I remembered when Yumi's father died.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yumi.png"/> Some things, you can only do because you're not alone…<br/>
It doesn't matter if it's a boyfriend, a friend, or family… You'll always have to part someday…<br/>
But… Our bonds mean we never truly have to say farewell…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I remembered when Hisano got a new lease on life.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Hisano.png"/> I know you must be a little tired… But there are still people waiting for you…<br/>
Have you really done everything you can for those precious to you?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I remembered Sayoko working until she collapsed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sayoko.png"/> Life… It's filled with so many things that are dirty, grotesque, and painful…<br/>
There's no way you can stand it alone…<br/>
But no one is truly alone in this world. You know that, since you've protected those precious to you, right?<br/>
C'mon, people are waiting for you…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I remembered Teddie's resolve to stay in our world.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Teddie.png"/> I'll… protect you, Sensei.<br/>
You gave me my life… You're important to me…<br/>
I'm not alone anymore… And neither are you, Sensei…<br/>
I'm sure together, we can do things that no one could do alone…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And I remembered Nanako. She'd be all alone again if I died…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Nanako.png"/> Are you going to leave me behind…?<br/>
I'll be a good girl…<br/>
So don't go…<br/>
I don't want you to go…<br/>
Big bro…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And I felt my strength return…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I felt the power of everyone's hearts united as one.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-P4-00074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I felt all of my Personas unite again into one.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-P4-00075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>And all of our power surged through it!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-P4-00078.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>The world came back into focus around me. I stood alone against Izanami. But this time, things would be different.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-P4-00081.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-P4-00082.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Izanami.png"/> Impossible… Can the will of so few surpass the will of all mankind!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>She struck out with all of her fury, but still I stood.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-P4-00084.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-P4-00085.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Izanami.png"/> How can your powers rival mine…?<br/>
Why…? Why don't you understand…? It's impossible for humans to grasp the truth with their own hands…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Well there's one truth of this world I'm certain of.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-P4-00093.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>There's no way we can lose to a thing like this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-P4-00095.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-P4-00096.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-P4-00097.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-P4-00099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>With all of our strength combined, we cast down the goddess of death.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-P4-00102.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Izanami.png"/> Instead of the endless struggle, wouldn't it be easier to wrap oneself in lies and live in blissful ignorance…?<br/>
Isn't that true peace for humans…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Kanji.png"/> How many times do we have to tell you!? The hell with that shit!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chie.png"/> Stop assuming you know us!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Izanami.png"/> *chuckle * Very well. Then try and live your way…<br/>
Power enough to erase my existence… You have already exceeded what I thought humanity to be capable of…<br/>
You have lifted the fog in this world, as well as the fog in your own…<br/>
And whether that will lead to happiness or not… rests upon your shoulders.<br/>
Children of man…<br/>
Well done…!<br/>
<br/>
<i>And Izanami dispersed like a morning fog.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-P4-00114.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Rise.png"/> Thank goodness…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Yukiko.png"/> It's really over now…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chie.png"/> Yep! This time it's alllll over!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> It seems this is more like a beginning for us, though.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Yosuke.png"/> Well now, we've got no regrets for tomorrow…<br/>
&gt; Friends that you can believe in, and the many people you have come to understand…<br/>
&gt; A strong heart bound to others, trying to ascertain the truth…<br/>
&gt; A firm belief in grasping the truth with your own hands without being misled or deceived…<br/>
&gt; The power of these things has brought judgement down on what deceived mankind, opening the door to a new tomorrow…<br/>
<br/>

Seriously You Should Watch These</a><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Igor.png"/> You have driven back a godly being and brought about a new world…<br/>
This will be the last time we summon you here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Margaret.png"/> Soon, the fog will lift, and our destination will be visible.<br/>
We will be arriving shortly.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Igor.png"/> This journey was a fruitful one, worthy of marking a turning point in your destiny.<br/>
Many a time along the way did the fog of lies prevent you from moving forth…<br/>
Yet in every instance, you overcame the temptation of easy exist and false terminals.<br/>
In forging bonds with those precious to you, you moved closer to the truth, one step at a time…<br/>
And my heart danced with delight to see you succeed.<br/>
I am most honored to have borne witness to such a wondrous journey.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Margaret.png"/> Our destination is close at hand now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Igor.png"/> Well then, we have finally come to your journey's true end.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Igor.png"/> Our contract has been fulfilled. My own duties end here as well…<br/>
…You were a truly remarkable guest.<br/>
Now go forth, and see with your own eyes.<br/>
See the world you have won… The bright, magnificent future…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I returned once more to the 'reality' of the TV world. The Yomotsu Hirasaka had faded around us. At first all we saw was fog…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-P4-00142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>But slowly, the fog lifted…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-P4-00143.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-P4-00144.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-P4-00145.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>And an amazing new world was revealed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-P4-00148.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Teddie.png"/> The fog is… all gone!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Yosuke.png"/> Wow!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chie.png"/> It's nice. It feels kinda… nostalgic.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-P4-00150.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Teddie.png"/> I know this place. This scenery.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-P4-00151.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Teddie.png"/> A long, long time ago, everywhere in this world used to look like this.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-P4-00156.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Yukiko.png"/> So this is the world inside people's hearts…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We stayed there a while, in that world we'd saved. The world we'll always share…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-P4-00162.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The human heart has the strength to shine through the clouds of lies and uncertainty.<br/>
&gt; You and your friends were able to prove that fact.<br/>
&gt; And that will remain true until the end of time…<br/>

You're Missing Out if You're Not Watching These</a><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chie.png"/> You really are leaving, huh? It hasn't really hit me yet…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Rise.png"/> N-No more Senpai from t-tomorrow on…<br/>
W-Waaaaaaah!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Kanji.png"/> Hey, quit crying…! It's way too soon for that!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Rise.png"/> But… But… Waaaah…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Kanji.png"/> Sheesh… Th-That stuff's kinda contagious, y'know…<br/>
You gotta put on a good face for Senpai…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Nanako.png"/> Big bro…<br/>
……<br/>
I don't want you to go away…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Dojima.png"/> Nanako… Didn't you promise that you wouldn't cry?<br/>
Building a case against Adachi is going pretty smoothly. After all, he's made a full confession to his crimes.<br/>
There haven't been any more incidents since then, Inaba's finally back to its normal, peaceful self.<br/>
And Nanako's better now too. I couldn't ask anything more.<br/>
Thanks for everything.<br/>
To me, you're just as much a part of this family as Nanako. I'm really glad you came to stay with us…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Teddie was thinking of returning to the TV world.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-P4-00183.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Teddie2.png"/> That's why… I'm going back over there.<br/>
To make sure it never goes wrong again… I'm going to protect that world from now on.<br/>
I can finally be proud and say… That world is where I belong.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Kanji.png"/> Man, Senpai… This town's gonna feel empty without ya.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Teddie2.png"/> How cruel! W-Were you even listening!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Yosuke.png"/> We can see you anytime we want, you dork!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chie.png"/> Like you'll be gone long. Soon as you start craving something like ice cream, you'll be back in a flash.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Teddie2.png"/> C-C'mon, my honeys. Bluffing that way isn't very cute, you know?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Yosuke.png"/> You're just gonna be going in and out of the TV at Junes. How's that different from what you've been doing?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> Um… I can't quite decide what to do…<br/>
At first, I only planned on staying here until the case was completely closed.<br/>
Maybe I should stick to my original plan… and take the train back with you, Senpai.<br/>
Kidding, of course… I couldn't do something like that.<br/>
It's not as though we'll never see each other again.<br/>
Feel free to call me anytime, even if there isn't a case to solve.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Even if we're parting for now, this isn't goodbye.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-P4-00200.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, you got any plans during the long holiday in May? If you're free, come over and visit.<br/>
With no mysteries to solve, we can have some real fun!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Yukiko.png"/> I'll make reservations now so that we can stay in my family's inn.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Teddie2.png"/> Ooh, I can get my revenge for that night… Our surprise sneak attack will work for sure this time!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Kanji.png"/> D-Don't bring that up, you stupid bear!<br/>
Hey, what happened to going back to that world!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Teddie2.png"/> That has nothing to do with this! It's entirely different!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Dojima.png"/> It's almost time. You'd better get on the train.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Everyone else had shown up at the station too.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-P4-00209.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Kou.png"/> Me and Daisuke'll definitely come crash at your place someday.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Ai.png"/> If anything happens, you can always come back here… I'll be waiting for you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yumi.png"/> As soon as I can look out for myself, I'll go see you.<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Dojima.png"/> Well be careful.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-P4-00222.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Nanako.png"/> I'll see you Big Bro. Bye-bye!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I didn't want to get on that train, but there was just no way around it.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Yukiko.png"/> Thank you for everything! Stay well until we meet again someday!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Teddie2.png"/> You'll always be my Sensei forever!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-P4-00226.jpg"/><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Teddie2.png"/> Doesn't matter how far apart we are.<br/>
The bonds we made will remain strong.<br/>
Everyone's heart is connected to the people they know and trust.<br/>
It's those bonds that let us all search for our purpose in life.<br/>
As long as it's a purpose you believe in, there will always be someone who can help you fulfill it.<br/>
You, me, and everyone else. There are no barriers.<br/>
Our hearts are one. Right, Sensei?<br/>
