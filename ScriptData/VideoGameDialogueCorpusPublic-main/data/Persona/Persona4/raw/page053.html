<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> Good morning.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> *sigh * Summer vacation's over already.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Yo, guys. I got lost on my way here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> The vacation was pretty long.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Not THAT long. Sheesh…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We had a bit of a surprise as we entered the gates.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Y-You…!? You're that, uh… pint-size detective!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Naoto.png"/> I beg your pardon!? My name is Naoto. Please, don't give people bizarre nicknames you make up on the spot.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> Um… You know this is a high school, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Naoto.png"/> My cooperation with the police has come to an end. However, there are aspects of the case with which I remain unconvinced.<br/>
There are some family-related issues as well, so I've decided to stay here for the present.<br/>
From today forth, I'll be a first-year at your high school.<br/>
And I felt that I should at least introduce myself to you all.<br/>
I trust our relations will be cordial, Senpai.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Senpai…?<br/>
That detective boy's… our underclassman?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was more concerned by what Naoto said about the case, especially with what Adachi said about them having a hard time even after the confession. Is this really all over with?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Kondo:</b> You've gotta watch out for unjustified resentment, guys! I'm sure you know what I mean; you all watch gossip shows!<br/>
You never know who has a grudge against you. My advice? Train your body regularly, so you can fight back!<br/>
Okay… Let's play soccer today!<br/>
But first! Pop quiz! Souji!<br/>
When was soccer first introduced in the Olympics?<br/>
<br/>
<i>They didn't have it at the first modern Olympics, I remembered that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Kondo:</b> That's right! Good job!<br/>
So let's get kickin'! Split into two teams!<br/>
And don't hurt yourselves, guys! Remember, the school trip is only a week away!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We decided to get together after school.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> With the case closed, the days feel so empty all of a sudden…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> C'mon Yosuke, everything went back to normal. It's a good thing!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> I didn't mean it that way. It's just…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> Hey, we're stopping by Junes later, right? Why don't we ask Naoto-kun to join us?<br/>
Oh, I just thought… Since he doesn't know anyone yet, he must feel lonely…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Didn't he say he came here to help out with the murder case?<br/>
With the case closed, he's just an ordinary guy now.<br/>
And if you think about it, that makes him a transfer student… just like us.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> Hello, Senpai!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Maybe he transferred here out of plain stubbornness.<br/>
'Cause he doesn't seem like he's only in it for fun.<br/>
Alright, let's see if he wants to hang out with us.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> A celebrity coming to school is already a surprise, but a detective is even rarer.<br/>
I'm a little curious to see what his family's like, too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> There's that, and the fact that he's a detective at his age.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Naoto was talking to a couple of first year girls, which wasn't going so well.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Conniving Girl:</b> You dunno the area yet, right? C'mon, we'll show you around.<br/>
<b>Girl's Friend:</b> There's probably tons of places to hang out that only we'd know about.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Naoto.png"/> That won't be necessary.<br/>
I'm not interested in "hanging out," and neither am I interested in you two.<br/>
<b>Conniving Girl:</b> Huh? Hey, what did you say!?<br/>
<b>Girl's Friend:</b> What's with that attitude!? We're just trying to be friendly!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Geez… Way to make an impression.<br/>
Yo, Naoto-kun. How's it going?<br/>
<b>Conniving Girl:</b> Oh, um…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kanji.png"/> H-Hey guys. 'Sup?<br/>
<b>Girl's Friend:</b> Uh, well, we'll be going now…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Naoto.png"/> So we meet again. May I help you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Hey, Naoto-kun. If you're not doing anything after school, wanna come with us?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Naoto.png"/> Come with… You mean me?<br/>
…Perhaps another time. I have some things to mull over.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> Things to mull over?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Naoto.png"/> I must go straight home today. I promised my Grampa so.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kanji.png"/> "Grampa"…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Oh well… That's that, then. Let's hang out some other time.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I guess Naoto must be here with relatives too. Anyway, we headed down to Junes just like old times.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Is he gonna be okay at Yasogami?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> He is different, but he has this… mysterious air around him that draws your attention.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Whoa, Yukiko, I never knew… You like younger guys?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> No, that's not what I meant…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kanji.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Naoto-kun said he has "things to mull over," but he's gotta be talking about the murder case.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> He's some ace detective, right? I bet he's not satisfied… even though the case is closed.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> That's true… but…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> This place isn't our "special headquarters" anymore…<br/>
Eh, let's talk about something else.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Isn't the class trip coming up soon?<br/>
Um… Where are we going…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think I've heard of this place we're going, there was some weird disease outbreak there last year.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00081.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> I heard it's an artificial island that faces the ocean. It's a pretty big city.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> Huh? Port Island?<br/>
I did tons of shoots there. It's just beyond the Moonlight Bridge, yeah?<br/>
Should be lots of places to hang out there.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Uh, actually… we may not have any time to goof off during this trip.<br/>
I heard the school board is changing the trip's schedule this year.<br/>
The idea is, we're gonna visit a private school there. Like, to have local and urban students interact or something.<br/>
It'll be all about studying and serious business… Yuck.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> Ugh… They're totally missing the point of a class trip.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> What kinda place is this private school?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> I heard it's really good. They have nice buildings and everything.<br/>
But it's closed on the day we're going there, so they're going the extra mile to make this work.<br/>
They want us to tour some factories on the second day, and then we're coming back on the third day.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> That's not different from a social studies field trip!<br/>
Urgh… I didn't want to know that…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kanji.png"/> Can't expect much from a school-sponsored trip, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kanji had the right idea I think.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00098.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> I'll show you guys around!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> But we're in different years…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> Oh, didn't you know? The excursion will be like the campout. They're going to combine the first and second years.<br/>
Since student enrollment is down and they're low on funds, they've cut the excursion back to once every two years.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kanji.png"/> Well, at least we won't be bored with you around, Senpai.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> Gosh, I'm trying to remember the last time I went to Port Island and I wasn't working… *chuckle * This'll be great!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> I wish I could be that positive about it… Doesn't this seem like a pain in the ass to anyone else?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Some people were against the proposition, but it's been decided. Oh, and guess who's idea it was? King Moron's.<br/>
It's just the kind of thing he'd come up with…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Nooo… King Moron…! Why must you torture us from beyond the grave…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Teddie.png"/> Noooo… King Moron…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kanji.png"/> You don't even know who that is.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Teddie.png"/> Hey, tell me more about this trip.<br/>
Where is Port Island? What's there?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Get back to work, will ya?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Well, even though the class trip is coming up, it's still a ways away.<br/>
What should I do until then…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kanji.png"/> Well, it's not like we got much to do here in the first place…<br/>
Man is just an animal trying to figure out how to kill time through his days…<br/>
<br/>
<i>You know you screwed up hard when Chie manages to land a huge burn.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00118.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Yet it made absolutely no sense.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kanji.png"/> S-Sorry…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> …Snrk.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Anyway, I headed to the hospital for a bit, Sayoko's really losing it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00124.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Sayoko isn't saying anything…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Souji.png"/> Did something happen?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Sayoko.png"/> …Stop it. Do you think you're some kind of counselor now?<br/>
I'm sorry…<br/>
There's no point in taking it out on you…<br/>
I just got a call from the hospital I last worked at.<br/>
The patient I was assigned to… died.<br/>
He was still just a little child…<br/>
He always said he wanted to go to school… But it looks like he'll never get that chance…<br/>
You know, he proposed to me… I told him I'd think about it when he became an adult.<br/>
But I… I forgot about him!<br/>
When I transferred here, I was so busy. I thought about him once in a while, but soon I just forgot…<br/>
But he was fighting for his life that entire time!<br/>
What am I doing…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's not her fault if she changed jobs, though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00139.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Sayoko.png"/> I do… Of course I blame myself…<br/>
Why did I transfer…?<br/>
When a patient gets better, I get left behind… But, now I'm the one who left a patient behind…<br/>
There should've been something I could have done…<br/>
&gt; Sayoko seems to be tormenting herself.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I tried to come up with something to say, but what could I?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00145.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Sayoko.png"/> Oh, I'm sorry…<br/>
…I'm glad you came today.<br/>
&gt; Sayoko looks at you with need in her eyes…<br/>
&gt; You feel that Sayoko trusts you.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still, if I can help in any way that's good.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00150.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Sayoko.png"/> …I'll do it. There has to be something… anything I can do.<br/>
Goodbye.<br/>
&gt; You left Sayoko and went home…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I just hope she doesn't do anything crazy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>9/2/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>It was nice this morning.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00157.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Lazy Student:</b> I feel soooooo tired coming to school… Soooo sleeeepeeeee…<br/>
I can't believe that I was early for class every single morning until just about a month ago…<br/>
<b>Gossipy Girl:</b> You're so lucky compared to me. I've been studying for my entrance exams all summer…<br/>
By the way, I'm so relieved that they caught the guy behind those murders.<br/>
I was surprised that it turned out to be a student.<br/>
<b>Lazy Student:</b> I've seen so many shows interviewing the police by now…<br/>
I'm soooo sick of it.<br/>
<br/>
<i>But it started raining later on in the day. I saw Naoto around in the hallways and decided to see if he wanted to do anything.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00165.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Naoto.png"/> Do you want something from me?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Souji.png"/> Let's go out.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Naoto.png"/> ……<br/>
No, I'd rather not.<br/>
&gt; You were bluntly turned down.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh well. Anyway, I've sort of started to like walks in the rain, and headed down to the shopping district.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00172.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Attendant:</b> The customers all seem to have stopped talking about it, like all of a sudden.<br/>
Is it all over now…? Be nice if it was.<br/>
<br/>
<i>That Namatame guy was also standing around.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00175.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Namatame.png"/> If the police can't gather the evidence… the victims… Mayumi… won't be able to rest in peace…<br/>
I hope… that justice will be served…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Adachi was slacking off at Junes. Again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00178.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Adachi.png"/> It's sure coming down out there, huh? I think I'll stay in here a bit longer.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided to call the gang back up and see if anything had gotten better in the TV world since we caught the killer. But if anything, things were worse. A strong Shadow had appeared in Void Quest.</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>Boss Battle- Escapist Soldier</b><br/>
This is pretty much a straight slugfest. It's a big nasty robot guy who can really take a hit and likes to throw out strong physicals. If you can manage to come in with a physical-resistant Persona that would be a big help, but otherwise there's not much to say about this guy.<br/>
<br/>
<i>This is really just ridiculous, I'm pretty sure that damn thing came straight from a TV show. I did find some farcical video game sword, which looks sort of unwieldy but seems to work pretty well. I also managed to fill Margaret's request.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00188.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Margaret.png"/> Ah! You have brought Black Frost, and he has Auto-Sukukaja… You have successfully completed the quest.<br/>
Do you know this Persona's tragic past?<br/>
Black Frost lived alone for over thousands of years…<br/>
While enduring this solitude, he prayed to the sky, over and over.<br/>
Pleading, "Give me a friend"…<br/>
Eventually, the god he served granted him a friend for a single day…<br/>
And the two of them frolicked through the fields, as happy as could be.<br/>
They spent many precious hours together… And then…<br/>
The sun set. The friend vanished…<br/>
Black Frost regretted his request.<br/>
If he had known he would have been left sad and lonely, he would never have asked for a friend in the first place.<br/>
Hence, Block Fro…<br/>
……<br/>
I didn't mispronounce it.<br/>
…Forget it. I made it all up anyway.<br/>
Did you believe me? Adults shouldn't be so easily swayed by what others say.<br/>
Anyhow, I appreciate that you showed me this wonderful card.<br/>
One after another, you make my every wish come true… What a gentleman.<br/>
Hmhm…<br/>
&gt; Margaret is smiling gently…<br/>
&gt; You became a little more intimate with Margaret…<br/>
<br/>
<i>She really did have me going.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00210.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Margaret.png"/> Well then… For my next request…<br/>
Show me a Yatagarasu equipped with the Megido skill… If anyone can do this for me, it's you.<br/>
I eagerly await your return.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We bugged out of the TV world after that. I found Dojima reading the paper, and remembered to ask about that article he was looking for.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-P4-00221.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Dojima.png"/> Ohh… Yeah, I found it. Were you worried about it?<br/>
……<br/>
It's about Chisato… my wife.<br/>
When she was killed by a hit-and-run…<br/>
……<br/>
I told you before, right? About the case where we never had a suspect?<br/>
Get it now…? There's nothing more I can say about it in this house.<br/>
Let's stop there.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Souji.png"/> Then let's go outside.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Dojima.png"/> …Hah.<br/>
You win…<br/>
&gt; Dojima sighs…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Dojima.png"/> She…<br/>
Nanako's mother was run over on her way to pick up Nanako from nursery school.<br/>
It was a cold day, and there were no witnesses, so they didn't find her until much later.<br/>
Until they got word to me, Nanako was waiting all that time at the nursery… All alone.<br/>
Waiting for a mother who would never come…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I can't even imagine how that must have been.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-P4-00239.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Dojima.png"/> That her father, whose job is to catch criminals… couldn't find a single lead…<br/>
……<br/>
But I haven't given up. I'll catch the guy.<br/>
I don't need a private life to do that. …Nanako will understand.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Souji.png"/> Is this what she wants?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Dojima.png"/> Even if it's not what she wants now, she'll understand someday…<br/>
……<br/>
I have to tell myself that…<br/>
&gt; Dojima looks exhausted…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Dojima.png"/> Sorry… leave me alone for now.<br/>
…Souji.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
&gt; You can sense Dojima's pain…<br/>
<br/>
<i>What can I do, though?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-P4-00253.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Anyway, I wonder what Port Island is like? I guess I'll get to find out pretty soon.</i>
