<i>With Yukiko safe, things returned to a fragile state of normalcy.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Chatty Girl:</b> I heard they've put up ads for part-time jobs on the town bulletin board!<br/>
I wonder if there's anything there I can make some easy cash with.<br/>
<b>Braided Girl:</b> Hmm… I don't think you have the Diligence to handle a job that takes a lot of time.<br/>
<b>Chatty Girl:</b> That's so mean!<br/>
Maybe I don't… But, I bet I'll be more diligent if I get a job!<br/>
I bet you wouldn't do too well with a job where you have to work with others because you lack Understanding, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke was in trouble in class, as usual.</i> <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Ms. Sofue:</b> Mesopotamia means "the land between the two rivers" in Greek.<br/>
In other words, the civilization was built between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers.<br/>
Mesopotamia, Indas, Egypt, Huang He… All of the four great ancient civilizations rose from river land.<br/>
The rivers provided many blessings, which allowed the cultures to flourish. Mesopotamia had some distinctive laws…<br/>
Mr. Hanamura, wake up! Pop quiz! What was the commonality among the four great ancient civilizations!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Ngh!? …What?<br/>
Souji, h-help me out! What does she mean by commonality?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Obviously, as Yosuke is my bro, I needed to help him out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Ms. Sofue:</b> Hmph, I guess you were paying attention. You're right, civilization began near rivers.<br/>
You should keep those words in mind. "Civilizations" and "by the river." It'll be helpful when you need it.<br/>
Anyhow… I'm glad you got it right.<br/>
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." …You'd be in big trouble if you were in Mesopotamia.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> …What's she mean by that?<br/>
I owe you big time for this, Souji. I better stay awake next time…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I headed into town to check out the job openings. Turned out that the gas station did not actually have an opening. There was a crummy-ass job I could do making envelopes in my room at night.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>There was another one to translate some stuff into Japanese.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>One was a volunteer position folding cranes for the hospital.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>The most 'real' job was one assisting at the local day-care center.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm not huge on kids but I am huge on having money to buy things that keep me from dying.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The children are extremely interested in you…<br/>
<b>Boy:</b> Mister, do you have a girlfriend?<br/>
<b>Girl:</b> Don't ask him that, you creep!<br/>
<b>Boy:</b> Let's play tag, Mister!<br/>
You're it!<br/>
&gt; You survived the children tugging you in every direction.<br/>
<br/>
<i>There was one kid left behind at the end.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It seems his guardian hasn't come to pick him up.<br/>
<b>Day Care Supervisor:</b> How are things, Souji-kun? Has everyone been picked up?<br/>
Looks like Yuuta-kun is still here.<br/>
It's always like this, though…<br/>
<br/>
<i>A woman showed up for him just then. I got a really odd vibe off of her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Boy:</b> …Whatever.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Eri.png"/> Are you… one of the supervisors?<br/>
I see…<br/>
I'm sure Yuu-kun will cause you trouble, but please take care of him…<br/>
<b>Day Care Supervisor:</b> Yuuta Minami…<br/>
He's full of energy during his play sessions… Maybe too much energy.<br/>
But once she arrives, he's a totally different kid… She's his stepmother, so I guess it can't be helped.<br/>
Yuuta-kun's father got remarried to that woman you just met.<br/>
I heard she's from the city… I really don't know what she's thinking.<br/>
Perhaps that's why Yuuta-kun is a troublemaker at school, too…<br/>
The other day, he…<br/>
&gt; The caretaker continues gossiping…<br/>
<br/>
<i>After nearly being burned to a cinder by a creepy bird monster, I have to say a day like this feels pretty damn good.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>Kou called me up earlier today, we decided to grab Daisuke and hang out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00085.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Kou.png"/> If you're bored, let's hang out. I'll call up Daisuke too.<br/>
How's that sound?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Souji.png"/> Sure.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Kou.png"/> Sweet! Don't forget, okay?<br/>
&gt; You made plans to go out.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We got on the train to Okina.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00091.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You came here with Kou and Daisuke…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Kou.png"/> Ahhh, I haven't breathed air this bad in a long time.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Daisuke.png"/> I know what you mean, I can't relax here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Kou.png"/> How 'bout you, Souji? Do you prefer urban places like this to more rural towns like Inaba?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I've actually been liking Inaba, monsters and all.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00097.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Kou.png"/> Is the town you come from as backwater as Inaba then, Souji?<br/>
I bet you had way more to do than go to Junes, though.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Daisuke.png"/> Hey, I like Junes.<br/>
It's super convenient, and they've got like, everything. That Yosuke dude is hilarious, too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Kou.png"/> Huh? What does Yosuke have to do with anything?<br/>
Although now that I think about it, aren't you friends with him, Souji?<br/>
The four of us should hang out sometime.<br/>
&gt; The three of you have a good time together…<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>With Yukiko still not feeling well, there's not much we can do. I did hear something interesting on the way to school this morning.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00108.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Chatty Girl:</b> The cultural clubs are accepting new applicants starting today!<br/>
You're welcome to join, even if you're already in a sports club. Hmm… Which cultural club should I join?<br/>
<b>Braided Girl:</b> Huh? You mean you joined a sports club after all that whining? And now you're trying to join a cultural club!?<br/>
Don't say you're confident just because you wished for luck in your exams!<br/>
<b>Chatty Girl:</b> Look, colleges look more at your extracurricular activities than your grades, right?<br/>
I think I should be joining clubs so I can show that I'm a real team player!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Given what happened the last time I joined a club, I figured I should look into this one after classes were done.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00115.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Kondo:</b> Just because it's such nice, warm weather doesn't mean you have time to be drowsy!<br/>
It's dangerous to fall asleep sometimes, you know that?<br/>
I mean, you could get mugged, or a thief could sneak into your house!<br/>
Hey, Souji!<br/>
Tell me, what time are thieves most likely to sneak into your house here in Japan?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I remembered hearing about this a while back, it's early in the morning when everyone's left for work.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00121.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You gave the answer you thought was right…<br/>
<b>Mr. Kondo:</b> Yup, as Souji says, mornings are the most dangerous time! You should be ready to react to anything in the morning!<br/>
Hm? You don't care because you're at school by that time?<br/>
……<br/>
Well, alright! Lets shake the sleepies out with a little endurance training! Line up, ladies and gentlemen!<br/>
Let's take a jog around the school!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Some guy in our class wanted some help.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00136.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Male Student:</b> My first thought was, "This is horrible! I'm stuck with King Moron as my homeroom teacher!" But, now…<br/>
My spring… It isn't over just yet…<br/>
…*sigh* Can I ask you to do something for me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I said sure.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Male Student:</b> Do you know that girl from our class who always goes up to the roof?<br/>
…I want you to go see what she's up to. No! Th-That's not what I meant!<br/>
I, uh… I just wonder what she does up there, that's all. Think you can ask her for me? Like, what's her hobby…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I told him I'd give it a shot, and headed up to the roof.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00148.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Long-Haired Girl:</b> Huh? What's the matter?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I asked her about her hobbies.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00151.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I didn't think I'd quite gotten all the information the guy had wanted, so I decided to try again some other time. Anyway, it was time to suck it up and go ask Morooka about the cultural clubs.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00159.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Morooka.png"/> The cultural clubs? You'd better not be interested in them just so you can meet girls, Mister!<br/>
…You can join either the drama club or the band.<br/>
Both clubs meet on the ground floor of the Practice Building. Go find them yourself!<br/>
Before you go… The culture clubs meet on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday!<br/>
So are we done here!?<br/>
Go home already! Are you staying at school to hang out with a girl later on or something!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm pretty much useless at music, so drama was an obvious choice.</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>Male Student:</b> Let's move on to tongue twisters.<br/>
Ready? The sixth chick cheek's shixth cheep… Argh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's a good thing someone at least could do it, because I wasn't even sure what the tongue twister was at first.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00173.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Yumi.png"/> …You're still not saying it correctly. Come on, you're our club president.<br/>
<b>Male Student:</b> Oh, a new guy?<br/>
You're Seta, from second year, right? The transfer student?<br/>
I see, I see. Welcome to the drama club!<br/>
I'm the club president, Nagai. And this is…<br/>
<br/>
<i>A very gung-ho person indeed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00179.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Yumi.png"/> I'm in the second year, same as you. It's nice to meet you.<br/>
<b>Suspicious Student:</b> Yumi, are you trying to get your hooks into the new guy already?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Yumi.png"/> Huh? Not in the slightest.<br/>
Anyway, let's continue practicing.<br/>
<b>Drama Club President:</b> We don't have a stage, and we haven't decided on a script yet, so we're just training. I'm sure you'll catch on.<br/>
Our club meets on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.<br/>
<b>Kind Student:</b> We're not gonna throw you out if you don't show up, but the more you train, the better you get, right?<br/>
I think being in the drama club helps you learn how to express yourself more eloquently.<br/>
Oh yeah, I'm the club's vice president. I'm not really much help, though…<br/>
<b>Drama Club President:</b> That's okay, Maaya. I know you put a lot of effort into it. Besides, you're so cute…<br/>
<b>Drama Club Vice President:</b> Don't call me Maaya in front of everyone!<br/>
&gt; it seems to be a friendly club…<br/>
<br/>
<i>While they were busy flirting, Yumi pulled me aside and offered to practice with me. She seemed pretty serious about all of this, so I agreed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00192.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Yumi.png"/> We'll start with voice lessons.<br/>
That's right, focus on your stomach…<br/>
Push the air out… Now, say "Ahh"!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Souji.png"/> Ahhh…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Yumi.png"/> That was good! You've gotten a lot better than when we started!<br/>
&gt; Yumi seems proud of you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Yumi.png"/> Huh! School's over already!<br/>
Everybody's already gone!<br/>
I didn't even notice…<br/>
I'll see you next time. Come to practice, okay?<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's hard to say no when someone's being this forceful.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00203.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Yumi.png"/> I'm glad to see you can take orders.<br/>
&gt; Yumi smiles cheerfully.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Yumi.png"/> Well, fate must've brought us here. Let's do the best with what we have.<br/>
&gt; You joined the drama club and became acquaintances with Yumi Ozawa.<br/>
&gt; Yumi is enthusiastically devoting her time to acting…<br/>
&gt; You feel a faint bond forming between Yumi and yourself…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I should maybe look up what these Arcana are even supposed to mean some time.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00211.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Yumi.png"/> Oh, yeah. Have you ever gone to see a play or a musical being performed live?<br/>
I have a DVD you can borrow. It'll definitely help your technique.<br/>
The other members in the drama club don't watch this kind of stuff, or even talk about it…<br/>
&gt; Yumi passionately discussed acting as you walked home together…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie's not sure when Yukiko will be feeling better, I'm just hoping it's soon. There's still a killer on the loose, and who knows when he might strike again?</i>
