<i>That beef stew turned out well.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You ate lunch with Yosuke.<br/>
&gt; You ate Well-Simmered Beef Stew together.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Wow, this is so good!<br/>
Is this your recipe, Souji? I only know how to boil eggs, myself…<br/>
&gt; It was Yosuke's favorite!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I saw Ai on the way out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I figured I'd ask her if she wanted to do anything.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Ai.png"/> Huh? …With you?<br/>
……<br/>
&gt; Ai is staring at you intently…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Ai.png"/> …Whatever.<br/>
You should skip your afternoon classes next time. We'll go somewhere far away.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I've faced down death but I'm still a bit too much of a wimp to skip classes, I'll have to get back to her on that. Anyway, I'd made that wish come true for the fox so I decided to report back.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It's probably worried about the outcome…<br/>
&gt; You told the fox that you granted the wish written on the ema.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Fox.png"/> *howl *<br/>
&gt; The fox looks exuberant.<br/>
&gt; The fox looks at the offertory box and seems pleased…<br/>
&gt; If rumors of the shrine's benevolence spread, more people may come to make offerings…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Fox.png"/> *howl *<br/>
&gt; You can sense the fox's gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Also if we ever need a henhouse raided, we've got just the man for the job.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You passed some time with the fox.<br/>
&gt; It's getting late.<br/>
&gt; You decided to go home…<br/>
<br/>
<i>They had some kind of special report on TV, something about those biker gangs.</i><br/>

<b>Narrator:</b> Our special report took a turn for the violent when one of the apparent leaders attacked the camera crew!<br/>
<br/>
<i>These guys are pretty bad at blurring.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Dojima.png"/> That voice…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kanji.png"/> This ain't a show! Get bent!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Dojima.png"/> Still up to the same old tricks…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Nanako.png"/> Do you know him, Dad?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Dojima.png"/> Mmm, well, I know him through work.<br/>
His name's Kanji Tatsumi… he's quite a handful. He's been crushing biker gangs in the area since middle school.<br/>
But I thought he got into a high school and started attending class…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Nanako.png"/> Huh.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Dojima.png"/> Man, that blur sure is pointless. It's completely obvious who it is.<br/>
The guy's family runs a historic textile shop.<br/>
I think what happened was, he crushed the local bikers all by himself because the noise kept his mother up at night.<br/>
It's a nice gesture, but he's way too violent… At this rate, his mother'll have to apologize again.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Nanako.png"/> Oh, the weather report's showing on the bottom. It's going to rain tomorrow.<br/>
I'll make sure to hang the laundry inside the house.<br/>
<br/>
<i>The rain's coming back. Will the Midnight Channel be on again?</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>5/14/11</b> <br/>
<br/>
<i>Sure enough the rains came.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> That means the show's probably gonna be on tonight.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> I hope we don't see anyone…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, that'd be the best. But if we do, maybe we'll see some kinda clue that can point us toward the killer…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> Well everyone, don't forget to check your TV tonight!<br/>
Got it?<br/>
&gt; It seems to be another rainy night.<br/>
&gt; What will you see on the Midnight Channel tonight…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>We checked the Midnight Channel, and sure enough someone appeared.</i><br/>

<br/>
&gt; It seems to be a man…<br/>
&gt; He looks like a high schooler…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; The image is unfocused, but it's hard to tell who it is…<br/>
&gt; Should you try calling Yosuke…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I called up Yosuke to see what he thought about it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> So, what do you think? That was a guy, wasn't it?<br/>
I wish I could tell what he looked like…<br/>
Let's get together and talk more about it tomorrow!<br/>
&gt; You hung up.<br/>
<br/>
<i>The guy seemed damned familiar, but I can't quite place where I've seen him before. Maybe one of the others knows. I'll have to ask tomorrow.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> Dude, take a breath!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> Oh, then does this make this place our special headquarters?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yes! Exactly! Nicely put, Yukiko.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> Special Headquarters… Hmm, it does have a nice ring to it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Anyways, as for what was on last night…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I hoped maybe one of the others had recognized the guy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00087.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> I saw it too!<br/>
I couldn't get a good view of the person's face, but it was a guy, wasn't it?<br/>
&gt; You told everyone that you saw someone who looked like a high schooler.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> So that's how I looked on TV…<br/>
Hm? Wait a moment.<br/>
Didn't all the victims have one thing in common? That they were females with ties to the first incident?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> That's what we thought…<br/>
But we still don't know who exactly we saw.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> In my case, the image on the Midnight Channel changed after I was kidnapped, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, the screen got clear all of a sudden and the program looked like some low-budget TV show.<br/>
Come to think of it, maybe Teddie was right… Maybe we were seeing the other Yukiko from that world.<br/>
But last night, we couldn't clearly see whoever it was.<br/>
Could that mean… he isn't inside the TV yet?<br/>
If so, then…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think Yukiko was right on the money, he's not been kidnapped yet.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00102.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> Uh-huh, I think that's safe to assume.<br/>
If we can figure out who he is, can we prevent him from being taken?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah… And if all goes well, we might catch the killer in the bargain.<br/>
*sigh * But to do that, we need to know who the latest Midnight Channel star is…<br/>
I hate to say it, but I guess we'll have to wait another night and see what happens.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> Ahehem... Well, that means if my deductions are correct…<br/>
Though the image was hard to make out, and we can't say for sure who it was, it was definitely a young male.<br/>
But if that's the case, it goes entirely against our prior assumptions…<br/>
Since we cannot identify the person at this time, we have no choice but to wait and see what happens!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> That's exactly what we just said.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> Shut up!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> *chuckle *<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's good to see Yukiko's back to normal but man when she gets going she just doesn't stop.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00115.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> Ahahaha, oh no! M-My funny bone…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> Not again…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> S-Sorry, heeheehee!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> This is how Yukiko really is, huh… Who'd have thought?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> By the way, about that guy we saw? I get the feeling I've seen him before…<br/>
Pretty recently, too…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, you too? Yeah, I've been thinking the same thing since last night…<br/>
Well, let's check the TV again tonight and think about it more tomorrow.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> Heehee…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> Grrr, when are you gonna stop that, you crazy hyena!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> Ahahaha! That's a good one, Chie!<br/>
<br/>
<i>This time, the Midnight channel was just a bit clearer, and we could tell who it was.</i><br/>

<br/>
&gt; The image is unfocused…<br/>
&gt; But you feel like you've seen him before…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Did you see that?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was sure this time. It was that guy from the news, Tatsumi.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00134.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, I think so too.<br/>
I knew I saw him somewhere! It was on TV! He was on that special news report!<br/>
He's one scary dude. He was even yelling at the camera to "Get bent!"<br/>
Alright, so we finally have a lead. Let's all get together tomorrow, okay?<br/>
Oh, I almost forgot… It's kinda off-subject, but as long as you're on the line, mind if I ask something?<br/>
It's something I've been meaning to ask for a while.<br/>
So… what do you think about Yukiko and Chie? I mean, let's not mince words: Which one's your type?<br/>
<br/>
<i>God damn Yosuke putting me on the spot. I mean I just met them, I barely even know them, how the hell should I know?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hahaha! Kinda harsh, don'tcha think?<br/>
Well, I kinda understand.<br/>
They're great girls, but you saw their ugly sides right off, and I guess your first impression is the one that sticks.<br/>
Hey, but don't worry. This is just between you and me.<br/>
Okay, see you tomorrow.<br/>
&gt; Yosuke hung up.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was pretty much when he told me not to worry that I actually started doing so. He'd better not tell them what I said, I don't want to get slapped or kicked or something.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Kanji Tatsumi, huh? He definitely didn't look like the social type.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> Now there's an understatement. Isn't he really scary? Did you see the news special the other day?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, I saw it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> You mean the special on biker gangs? I watched it too.<br/>
He wasn't like that when he was younger, though…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> You know him, Yukiko?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> Uh-huh, but we haven't talked to each other in a long time.<br/>
His family runs a textile shop, and we've been a customer of theirs for many years.<br/>
So I speak with Kanji-kun's mother from time to time.<br/>
Oh, why don't we go there now? We might be able to talk to him in person.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> Sounds good. At the very least, we can ask if anything strange has come up lately.<br/>
I wouldn't want to run into him in a dark alley, but I'm pretty sure he won't fly off the handle in his family's store.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Alright, then let's get going.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> If things get rough, we're counting on you guys!<br/>
<br/>
<i>There was some weird guy talking to Kanji's mother already when we got in there.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00168.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Shop Owner:</b> Ah, Yuki-chan. It's so nice to see you.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I guess the person was leaving as we entered. I hadn't seen them around before, maybe they weren't from around here.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00170.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Shop Owner:</b> I'm sorry that I couldn't help more.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Naoto.png"/> It's all right; you've given me plenty to think about. Thank you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> What's up with him…? Weirdo.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> I 'unno. Never seen him before.<br/>
<b>Shop Owner:</b> Yuki-chan, you're as lovely as always.<br/>
Your features are starting to remind me of your mother when she was young.<br/>
How can I help you today? Are you out shopping with your friends?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> Oh, um… Well, actually…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie saw something that brought back some bad memories while we talked with Mrs. Tatsumi.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00180.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hm? Huh, you're right. Where was that…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> Oh! It was that place! Inside the TV!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> That's right! That room with those faceless posters…<br/>
Then… it's that announcer's…<br/>
<b>Shop Owner:</b> Are you acquaintances of Ms. Yamamo?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Uh, well, kinda…<br/>
Um… Did Ms. Yamano happen to have a scarf like this?<br/>
<b>Shop Owner:</b> Yes, it was a special order she placed.<br/>
She actually ordered a pair, but in the end, she said she only wanted the women's scarf.<br/>
It left us with no choice but to sell this one separately.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> Oh man… There IS a connection to the first case…! What are we gonna do…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> H-How should I know…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Just then a delivery came, and Mrs. Tatsumi had to leave.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00193.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Shop Owner:</b> Oh, I'll be right there. I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> Oh, it's okay. We should get going.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> I'll come again, Ma'am.<br/>
<b>Shop Owner:</b> Is that so? Well, then please say hello to your mother for me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> It really is connected to the first case after all…<br/>
But it's just a scarf. Would the killer target someone just because of that…?<br/>
Dammit, what's going on…?<br/>
C'mon, let's talk outside.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We stepped outside and got a surprise.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00202.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Wha-Quick, hide!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kanji was talking with the boy from earlier.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00205.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Shhh! I can't hear what they're saying!<br/>
&gt; You eavesdropped on Kanji's conversation with the boy…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kanji.png"/> T-Tomorrow's fine with me…<br/>
Huh? S-School? 'Course I'm going to school…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Naoto.png"/> Then I'll meet you at the gates after school tomorrow.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kanji.png"/> D-Did he was he was interested…?<br/>
He's a guy… and I'm a guy… But… he's interested in me…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>At that point Kanji noticed us. I mean we weren't exactly hiding so much, not a surprise.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00213.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>We ran our asses away, not gonna lie.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-P4-00214.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> The one on TV last night was definitely Kanji-kun…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah… And I just realized something.<br/>
Remember the common points we were talking about? His mom fits the pattern. She's a woman, and she knew Ms. Yamano.<br/>
But it was her son who appeared on TV… So what does that mean?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Patterns or no, it's clearly people who've been appearing on the Midnight Channel who have disappeared.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-P4-00219.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, that's what it seemed like, based on the TV image… But his mother fits the pattern more than he does.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> Oh… Maybe it's similar to my case.<br/>
If you think about it, my mother fit the victim profile more than I did.<br/>
She was the one who dealt directly with Ms. Yamano… but I was the one who was targeted.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> Does that mean it'll be the kid again, instead of the mother?<br/>
But if that's true, then the killer's motive makes no sense at all.<br/>
It'd have nothing to do with silencing witnesses or revenge or anything.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie makes some scary good points sometimes.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-P4-00227.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Or is there some kinda secret in the textile shop itself…?<br/>
Argh! I'm totally lost!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> But we can't ignore this.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> Hmmm… Why don't we just go ahead and ask Kanji himself?<br/>
We could at least see if anything odd's happened lately. He scares the wits out of me, but…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, wasn't Kanji making plans with that weird kid a moment ago?<br/>
Something about meeting up at school.<br/>
I heard he's been skipping school ever since the new year started… Doesn't that see a little suspicious?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> Yeah, something did seem weird.<br/>
Yeah, it's suspicious all right. There's something funny going on here… I can sense it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> "Sense"? You sound like Teddie… Still, we might find some clues.<br/>
Alright… Let's try staking out both Kanji and his family's store.<br/>
We definitely don't want the killer getting ahead of us.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke is like the least smooth person ever, just to point it out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-P4-00241.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> Hey… Was this your plan all along?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Uh, no? I got everybody's number except for hers.<br/>
And the Y section of my address book needs some filling out.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Chie.png"/> *sigh * While we're on the subject, could you stop calling me at night just to tell dirty jokes?<br/>
You really sound like a pervert.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> H-Hey! I'm trying to have a conversation with Yukiko here!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> ……<br/>
Oh, that reminds me… I need to buy tofu on my way home.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Whoa… She didn't hear a word I said…<br/>
