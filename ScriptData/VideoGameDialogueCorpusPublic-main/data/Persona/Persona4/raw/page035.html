	<h3><strong>Part 35:</strong> 7/1/11-7/3/11</h3>
			<b>7/1/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>July started on a horrible, rainy note. I decided to get an Aiya bowl to cheer me up. Then I headed to the hospital, our funds are still a bit low.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hisano.png"/> Good evening…<br/>
I'm sorry about what happened last time, when I was staring at your face.<br/>
You just… You looked like someone I knew.<br/>
&gt; The old woman smiles gently…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hisano.png"/> Do you work here?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> Only part-time…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hisano.png"/> My, is that so. That's wonderful…<br/>
I have a granddaughter about your age… She went back home today, though…<br/>
Thinking about it… Meeting you here is a wonder…<br/>
But I won't be coming back here anymore…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided to just get the big question over with.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hisano.png"/> Haha…<br/>
This isn't a big town; we might run into each other eventually.<br/>
I like to take in the sun at the riverbed when I have days off.<br/>
The river sparkles so beautifully… It all feels so good, it saddens me.<br/>
Haha, I'll be going now.<br/>
&gt; The old woman left…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sayoko showed up as the old woman left.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Sayoko.png"/> That room over there needs some work done in it. Perhaps you could…?<br/>
…Oh, whatever, just get in there.<br/>
<br/>
<i>The room was indeed a mess.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Sayoko.png"/> The patient who had been in this room left just a little while ago. I want you to mop the floor.<br/>
…Don't ask what happened here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> …Okay.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Sayoko.png"/> Oho, I was just kidding.<br/>
The patient who was here was released today. He returned right from the brink of death!<br/>
&gt; Sayoko smiles mischievously…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Sayoko.png"/> He was a good patient, who always listened to what I said.<br/>
Plus, he was the president of his company at a young age. He was handsome, didn't complain, and independent.<br/>
He wanted to get back to his work… Desperately.<br/>
And, thanks to his perseverance, he was able to leave even earlier than we had scheduled to release him.<br/>
"Thank you for caring for me," he said, bowing to me so happily…<br/>
Then he turned and walked out.<br/>
He said such stupid things, like that he loved me.<br/>
…Everyone leaves.<br/>
They only need me when they're my patients… In the end, they all leave me.<br/>
<br/>
<i>You know, some days I'm glad my biggest worry is that I'll be horribly killed by evil monsters.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Sayoko.png"/> You make it sound easy…<br/>
Well, I guess that's to be expected. You're still a high school student… and it's not like you know me.<br/>
&gt; Sayoko smiles sadly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Sayoko.png"/> …I must not have been making sense. Forget about what I was saying.<br/>
I'll ask another janitor to handle this room. You go on home.<br/>
The streets are dark… You shouldn't be here.<br/>
You wouldn't want to get caught… by me.<br/>
&gt; Sayoko gives you a faint smile…<br/>
&gt; You feel that you just saw a bit of Sayoko's inner self…<br/>
<br/>
<i>For all that over the top stuff earlier I think she's actually a really nice person.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Sayoko.png"/> Nice work.<br/>
<br/>
<i>There's rain on the forecast again next week. Will the fog come then? I guess I'll know soon enough.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>7/2/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>It turned out I didn't need to bug Daisuke into doing what we wanted him to.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Daisuke.png"/> That's her. My ex-girlfriend.<br/>
She shows up every so often to watch us practice.<br/>
I wonder if she's as stuck in the past as I am…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> Could be.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Daisuke.png"/> Then… we definitely need to talk. Not just for me, but for her, too.<br/>
&gt; Daisuke nod with a gentle expression…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Daisuke.png"/> Thinking back on it…<br/>
I… should've just told her everything that was on my mind.<br/>
Even if the truth hurt, at least we would have understood each other…<br/>
Well, I'll talk to her after practice.<br/>
&gt; Thanks to your and Kou's efforts, Daisuke is taking a big step…<br/>
<br/>
<i>He understood that he needed to make an effort to change.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00077.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>By sheer luck I managed to see what happened next.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Daisuke is talking with his ex-girlfriend…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Daisuke.png"/> I just want you to know… I really did like you, back then.<br/>
<b>Daisuke's Ex:</b> ……<br/>
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Daisuke.png"/> ……<br/>
Hey, have you been coming to practice because of you…<br/>
<b>Daisuke's Ex:</b> Oh, he's here.<br/>
Get outta the way, or he might get the wrong idea.<br/>
Senpai, you're late!<br/>
<b>Varsity Player:</b> Sorry about that. Tearing down the goals took a little longer than usual today.<br/>
<b>Daisuke's Ex:</b> So you'll take me somewhere nice for dinner then, right? *giggle *<br/>
<b>Varsity Player:</b> Sure, sure.<br/>
Daisuke…? What's up, man?<br/>
I'll see ya at practice. Later.<br/>
<b>Daisuke's Ex:</b> Daisuke… Thank you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Daisuke.png"/> ……<br/>
<br/>
<i>For just a second I thought he hadn't taken it well.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00097.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Daisuke laughs with relief.<br/>
&gt; You walked home with him.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I started work on that guy's model robot earlier, this is going to take a while I think. The fog is definitely coming next week, though again I'm not sure why I'm worried. I mean we rescued Rise, everything should be fine.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>7/3/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I was walking down by the river earlier and had an unexpected encounter.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00109.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hisano.png"/> Oh, you don't happen to be… the hospital janitor?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> That's right.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hisano.png"/> My, I didn't think I would see you here.<br/>
It's a nice day today… Would you take the time to talk with this old woman?<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was indeed a nice day and I didn't have anything pressing so I agreed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00114.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hisano.png"/> My, I'm so happy.<br/>
&gt; The old lady smiles gently…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hisano.png"/> Good day, umm…<br/>
&gt; You introduced yourself.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hisano.png"/> Souji Seta… Souji-chan, is it?<br/>
Haha, a lovely name. It suits you.<br/>
I've lived here all my life, but… I don't know you.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I told her how I came to be here.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00122.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hisano.png"/> My, is that so? If you're from the city, you may think it's a bit inconvenient here… But I think it's a nice town.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> I think so, too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hisano.png"/> Haha, that's nice to hear. It's good to hear pleasant things about your home.<br/>
Oh, dear. I'm sorry, I haven't introduced myself.<br/>
My name is Hisano Kuroda.<br/>
……<br/>
I am Death.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Given all the supernatural stuff that happens around here I think I was right to be somewhat concerned by a statement like that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00130.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hisano.png"/> …I'm sorry. I'm saying foolish things.<br/>
Souji-chan, you're still not used to this town, are you?<br/>
If you ever have any problems, I can give you some advice.<br/>
Haha… Though I'm sure you'd rather spend your time with younger ladies.<br/>
&gt; She seems to be a kindly old woman, even though she called herself "Death."<br/>
&gt; You have become acquaintances with Hisano Kuroda.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I wonder how many of these there can be?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00137.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hisano.png"/> I hope we can meet again.<br/>
Goodbye, now.<br/>
&gt; You left Hisano and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm still working on that model, it's not quite ready yet.</i>
