<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Look at this weather, man.<br/>
What's up with this…? It's really weird. Have you ever heard of anything like this before?<br/>
Oh, yeah, and finals start today. But that's seriously not the point now.<br/>
What's going to happen?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> I'm worried, too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I thought that stuff about the fog being harmful to people was just a rumor, but people are getting sick.<br/>
And even besides that, there have been a lot of weird rumors spread around, too.<br/>
Damn… I don't like how any of this feels.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke's definitely right, something's deeply wrong here. Anyway, exams are just as easy as last time.</i><br/>

<b>Sporty Student:</b> Argh, there's no way we can keep the club going like this. Too many of our members are calling in sick.<br/>
When is this damn fog gonna clear up!?<br/>
<b>Younger Student:</b> But, Senpai, the people who are just slacking off aren't showing up either, right?<br/>
You can keep the club with the members you're left with.<br/>
Maybe the fog helped you find out who's the most dedicated to being in the club!<br/>
<b>Sporty Student:</b> Huh?<br/>
Well, that's one way of looking at it, I guess.<br/>

<b>Girl With Bag:</b> Hey, did you hear what they say happened on the Midnight Channel!?<br/>
Someone said they watched it, and there was a picture of this town in complete ruins!<br/>
<b>Bespectacled Girl:</b> Huh? My friend said that she saw Inaba get swallowed by the fog and sent into some other dimension!<br/>
She said there were monsters coming out of the fog, too! Like in that story…<br/>
<b>Girl With Bag:</b> Have you noticed…? Ever since this fog started…<br/>
It seems that some people can see the Midnight Channel even when it's not raining…<br/>
Could it be… Is our town getting more and more messed up!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>What the hell does that even mean? None of this is making sense anymore. What WAS the Midnight Channel anyway?</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> The weather report said it might start snowing soon, but what's going to happen if it snows with all this fog?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Chie.png"/> Whoa, where'd you guys come from!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Wow… That's quite a crowd you got there.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Chie.png"/> We ran into each other back there, so we came together.<br/>
The fog's so thick that sometimes you can't see your nose in front of your face, so everyone's forming groups now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> It's definitely been weird lately. It's so cold, too…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Rise.png"/> Visibility's so bad, it's scary… Can I stick close to you, Senpai?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Chie.png"/> *sigh * This girl never changes…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Rise.png"/> It really is hard to see anything in this, though. It's just like on the other side.<br/>
<br/>
<i>That gave Kanji an idea, which led to a terrible realization for us.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; When you put your glasses on, your vision becomes much clearer…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Yukiko.png"/> Whoa… It's all clear…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Wh-What the hell is going on!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Naoto.png"/> These glasses are meant to help us see through the fog in the other world…<br/>
But putting that aside, no glasses would improve one's visibility in a fog, under normal circumstances.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Chie.png"/> Then, umm…<br/>
Could the fog from over there be leaking into our world…?<br/>
Huh? Y-You guys think that's it!? I-I was kinda expecting you to ignore it as Chie being random again…<br/>
I-It's just a thought… Haha…<br/>
&gt; The mood darkens…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Anyways… today's the last day of exams, right?<br/>
Let's get 'em over with so we can meet up at the special headquarters after school.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Yukiko.png"/> Wow… We haven't used that name in a while…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We did still have some exams, but they're a joke as always.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You answered every question with ease…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; The answers seem to be flowing from your hand!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Then we went to Junes to talk about the case. We had a newspaper to read.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Chie.png"/> "Some specialists are raising concerns that this fog may consist harmful substances…<br/>
"More and more citizens are calling for an investigation into the cause of the fog and the facts about it…<br/>
"Thought the government has begun its preliminary investigation, many feel that the causes will be hard to pinpoint…"<br/>
Huh… Is this fog really dangerous?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kanji.png"/> You hardly ever see people walkin' around town anymore… Or here, either.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Rise.png"/> Everyone's too scared of the fog now to go outdoors much.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Teddie2.png"/> It does seem a lot like the fog on the other side…<br/>
But beyond that, I'm clueless.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Naoto.png"/> There's another item of note here… A summary of Namatame's career, with details about the case.<br/>
"…The suspect was having an affair with the first victim. It seems she was killed due to relationship troubles.<br/>
"Also in April, Ms. Saki Konishi's body was discovered. The police are looking into a motive for the murder.<br/>
"In July, a boy living in Inaba performed a copycat murder.<br/>
"The boy was initially thought to be the culprit behind all the killings, but later suspicion was thrown upon Namatame.<br/>
"Last month, the suspect attempted to kidnap a seven-year-old girl of Inaba, resulting in his arrest…"<br/>
<br/>
<i>I have to say that was already bothering me. I mean the best they can do is guess he killed Yamano due to relationship problems? That's all they've got?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-P4-00099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> So it's finally over. A lot of stuff's happened…<br/>
But all that's left is for the police to build a case for Namatame, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> Can they prove anything?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I'm sure your uncle can…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Rise.png"/> But… the stuff he was saying was so obviously nuts.<br/>
If he says anything about the TV world, he might be considered mentally unstable…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Yukiko.png"/> Also, I heard before that if the police don't have enough hard evidence, it's difficult to build a case.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Naoto.png"/> Yes… There are many such cases and culprits. It's the eternal conundrum for crime investigators…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kanji.png"/> So even if they're caught… the law can't do shit?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Naoto.png"/> …It's a possibility.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kanji.png"/> Hell's up with that!?<br/>
We all know he did it…<br/>
You can't just let a maniac who thinks he's saving people by killing them run wild on the streets!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> They better not dismiss something this serious because of some mental issues…<br/>
Saki-senpai…<br/>
No… Not just her, or that announcer… Even King Moron is his fault.<br/>
If it weren't for what he did, nobody would've tried a copycat killing.<br/>
It's his fault Nanako-chan's in the hospital right now, too…<br/>
<br/>
<i>That reminded me of the promise I'd made to Nanako before Namatame kidnapped her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-P4-00118.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Chie.png"/> What's the matter?<br/>
&gt; You told the others about your promise with Nanako…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kanji.png"/> A kotatsu…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Chie.png"/> Oh, then why don't we go check them out right now?<br/>
I know Nanako-chan would be psyched if she came home and found a new kotatsu!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Dude, why didn't you tell me sooner? The winter season's coming up, and we just got a bunch of 'em in stock!<br/>
Alright, off to the housewares section! For Nanako-chan!<br/>
<br/>
<i>They had some really nice ones.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-P4-00126.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kanji.png"/> It's a cliché because it's true, dammit.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Naoto.png"/> The best complement to a kotatsu would be a heated rug.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Dude, that much juice would kill the breaker the moment you tried to microwave something.<br/>
Oh yeah, you've never used a kotatsu before, huh Ted? It's nice and toasty.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Teddie2.png"/> Can I still stay here…?<br/>
You kept your promise to me… So I should be going back…<br/>
But I don't want to go until Nana-chan gets better.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Of course you can stay. How many times do we have to say this before it gets through to you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Chie.png"/> Nanako-chan would be sad if you weren't there when she wakes up.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Teddie2.png"/> B-But… I couldn't save Nana-chan…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Rise.png"/> Don't be silly. We saved her together.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kanji.png"/> We caught the killer, man. We couldn'ta done that without you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Yukiko.png"/> Teddie, you shouldn't talk that way when Nanako-chan is still fighting.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Teddie2.png"/> You guys…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Teddie keeps talking like he's going away. It's worrying…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-P4-00141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Teddie2.png"/> Sensei… I'm so touched!<br/>
I'll stay by your side until Nanako-chan comes home, Sensei!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, that's right… There's no one but you at your place.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Chie.png"/> Hey, why don't we pick out a Christmas present for Nanako-chan while we're at it?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Yukiko.png"/> Oh, that's a great idea! I'm sure she'll be out of the hospital by then.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Alright, but none of this "charge it to Yosuke" stuff this time. Seriously. We're clear on this, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Chie.png"/> Aw come on, why would we do something like that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Dude, the clothes you got for this guy? I almost pissed my pants when I saw the receipt!<br/>
How many days you think I had to work to pay that off!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Chie.png"/> Well, I can't help it if Junes overcharges for things.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Urgh…!<br/>
Well, I guess you gotta expect that… It's not like Chie-san's ever had the occasion to help a guy shop before.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Chie.png"/> Wha--!? What did you just say!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Teddie2.png"/> C'mon, baby. Don't fight over me…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Chie.png"/> Stay outta this!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Yukiko.png"/> Snrk… Heeheeheehee…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Rise.png"/> Let's leave them be and think of a present for Nanako-chan on our own.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kanji.png"/> But what would a girl her age want…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Naoto.png"/> What do you think Nanako-chan would appreciate most?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided we couldn't go wrong with Jack Frost.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-P4-00161.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kanji.png"/> Yeah, that white, round shape's the best. A plush doll's the way to go!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> All right, as soon as Nanako-chan's out of the hospital, we'll have a party at your place!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Chie.png"/> Yesss! And we'll bake the cake!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Rise.png"/> Of course!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Yukiko.png"/> Let's make it a cake to remember.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Oh no you're not! Are you trying to send Nanako-chan back to the hospital!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>And that's when life decided to start shitting all over us. Adachi called.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-P4-00168.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Adachi.png"/> Hello? This is Adachi. Um, I want you to stay calm and listen to me, okay?<br/>
Nanako-chan's condition suddenly got worse…<br/>
The doctor wants you to come to the hospital immediately… We'll be waiting.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> C-C'mon, let's go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We rushed down to the hospital as fast as we could get there. We even had to push past some of those goddamn gas mask crazies.</i><br/>

&gt; Dojima is listening to an explanation from the doctor…<br/>
&gt; There have been loud voices throughout the hospital for some time now…<br/>
<b>Woman's Voice:</b> Doctor, this fog is poisonous, isn't it? Isn't it filled with viruses?<br/>
They said so on TV! Isn't there a vaccine or something for it!?<br/>
<b>Nurse's Voice:</b> Calm down, please. That's just a rumor…<br/>
<b>Man's Voice:</b> Don't tell me to calm down! You're lying! We know you have medicine for this!<br/>
Are you just going to stand there and watch us die!?<br/>
<b>Nurse's Voice:</b> Why would we do something like that!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Chie.png"/> What a commotion…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Dojima.png"/> What the hell's that supposed to mean!? Can't you see how much pain she's in!?<br/>
<b>Doctor:</b> All we can do right now is monitor her condition closely. Dojima-san, you need to return to your-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Dojima.png"/> I don't give a damn about myself! Do something about Nanako-<br/>
Nngh…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Dojima-san!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Dojima.png"/> Just save her… For god's sake, please save Nanako…<br/>
<b>Doctor:</b> …We'll do our best.<br/>
I must ask you to step outside for the time being.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Dojima.png"/> Nanako…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We couldn't do anything but stand around outside Nanako's room. Everyone else was so upset, I don't know. Seeing them like that just made me even more certain I had to keep my head in the game, no matter what happened.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-P4-00194.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> This all has to do with the world you came from! Can't you figure something out!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Teddie2.png"/> I'm thinking… I'm thinking, but…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kanji.png"/> Dammit! Why does this have to happen to a little girl like her…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> Calm down.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kanji.png"/> How'm I supposed to stay calm at a time like this!?<br/>
Can't believe this is happening…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Chie.png"/> Nanako-chan's gonna be okay… right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Adachi.png"/> You guys still here?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Naoto.png"/> How is Dojima-san doing?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Adachi.png"/> His wound's opened up again. They're treating it over in his room now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Any luck with your investigation of Namatame…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Either Adachi's just a retard or he's intentionally fucking with us. I'm not goddamn sure but it's just bullshit all the stuff he comes out and says.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-P4-00206.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Adachi.png"/> I won't mince words here… We're gonna have a hard time making these charges stick.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> What's that mean?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Adachi.png"/> I talked with the guys at the station, and it'll be next to impossible to find him guilty in court.<br/>
Especially given the reason why we took him off our list of suspects for the first case…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Chie.png"/> Oh yeah… something about him having an alibi…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Adachi.png"/> Yeah, that. And the whole angle about him putting people into TVs… There's no way that'll stand up in court.<br/>
No one would believe that…<br/>
What the public wants is when, where, and how Namatame killed these people.<br/>
And Dojima-san knows it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kanji.png"/> Well, ain't you calm about this.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Adachi.png"/> I-I'm just telling you the truth.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kanji.png"/> And you call yourself a cop!? Huh!?<br/>
If you wanna see that stuff so bad, we'll show you! Hurry up and bring a TV here, dammit!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Rise.png"/> Hey, stop-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kanji.png"/> What the…?<br/>

<i>The nurse ran out…</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>Nurse:</b> Hurry inside! Please talk to her!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> What the hell…? What's going on!?<br/>
