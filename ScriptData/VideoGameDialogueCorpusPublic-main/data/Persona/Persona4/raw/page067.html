			<b>10/1/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>Today was pretty crappy and rainy, and nobody wanted to do anything. Heaven help me, I went fishing. By coincidence I actually think I managed to solve that guy's problem.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>I'd, uh, better not show him what I fished up next.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm sick and tired and I'm calling it a night, I'll talk to that guy next time I see him.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>10/2/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie called, we all headed out somewhere. Except Yosuke, because at some point he figured out that you should  never do this thing we're doing.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The group came on the girls' insistence…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> ……<br/>
Why here…? I thought we were gonna celebrate saving Naoto…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Rise.png"/> Yeah! We're gonna celebrate with a shopping spree! And you have the honor of carrying our bags.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> Senpai… now I need saving.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Souji.png"/> Give it up, Kanji.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Chie.png"/> Attaboy, Souji-kun.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Yukiko.png"/> I'm going to buy a lot today.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Rise.png"/> Me too! I've got money to burn!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> Alright, alright…<br/>
Tch… I should've told 'em I had to watch the house, like Yosuke-senpai…<br/>
&gt; It promises to be an entertaining day.<br/>
&gt; You spent an afternoon with the group.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dojima wanted to give me something when I got home.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> Let's go for a walk in a bit.<br/>
There's somewhere I want to go with you and Nanako.<br/>
Oh, and…<br/>
Here, have this.<br/>
&gt; You obtained Coffee Mug.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> It's the same kind that Nanako and I use.<br/>
This is your personal mug. Write your name on it later.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Souji.png"/> Thank you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> No problem. Take good care of it.<br/>
&gt; Dojima is smiling cheerfully.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> We're family.<br/>
So, I'll fill your and Nanako's mugs anytime.<br/>
…Don't forget that, Souji.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Nanako.png"/> Ready, Dad?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> Yeah, let's go.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Nanako.png"/> Let's go, big bro!<br/>
&gt; The three of you went out for a walk, with Nanako in the middle.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We went down to the Samegawa.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Nanako.png"/> But it's fun with you and big bro!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> Don't fall in.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Nanako.png"/> Why'd we come here?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> You've been saying all this time how you wanted to come here, right?<br/>
Let's come again on a nicer day. We can have a picnic.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Nanako.png"/> Yeah! Yay!!<br/>
Can I go closer to the river?<br/>
The fish might be sleeping!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> Alright, alright. Watch your step, okay?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Nanako.png"/> Okay!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nanako ran over to the riverside as we kept talking.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> ……<br/>
Souji, I'm going to keep up my search for the criminal who ran over Chisato.<br/>
But this time, it's not to escape from anything.<br/>
I'm just doing it because… I'm a detective.<br/>
Seems I forgot something as basic as that.<br/>
You made me remember what's important to me.<br/>
I owe you for that.<br/>
This town is my town. It's the place where you and Nanako live.<br/>
That's why I'm gonna live on, protecting this place. As a detective… as a father.<br/>
&gt; Dojima has a refreshing smile on his face…<br/>
&gt; You feel a tight bond between you and Dojima…<br/>
<br/>
<i>At least Dojima's stopped running now.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00072.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>He's going to keep what's important first.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>But he's still Dojima.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Young Man's Voice:</b> Dammit! He's still after us!!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> What the?<br/>
…Hey, he's…<br/>
You there! What's wrong!?<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> Detective Dojima…?<br/>
I-I'm sorry to bother you while you're off duty…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> Don't sweat it. Who are they?<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> Oh, it's that group of juvie thieves. You know, the one that's been the talk of the town…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> Thieves!? Those punks…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Nanako.png"/> Dad, are you going?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> Yeah…<br/>
Arresting the bad guys is my… I mean, your father's job.<br/>
Souji, take care of Nanako.<br/>
<br/>
<i>He wouldn't be happy if he weren't doing this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00093.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> Yeah!<br/>
&gt; A big smile spread across Dojima's face.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> Don't you know who I am? I'm Detective Dojima of the Inaba PD, feared by punks and thugs city-wide.<br/>
Don't you two worry about me. Head on home, okay?<br/>
Awwwwwwwright! Stop right there, you punks!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Nanako.png"/> Go get 'em, Dad!<br/>
He's so cool…!<br/>
Let's go home.<br/>
I need to get the bath ready… Oh, and let's make a late night snack!<br/>
I'm hungry.<br/>
&gt; You talked about what you could prepare as you walked home…<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>Kashiwagi does the strangest lectures sometimes.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00106.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Kashiwagi.png"/> I'm sure you all know the mucous membrane of the eye is protected by tears.<br/>
But did you know tears taste different depending on the situation?<br/>
Tears of regret are salty, sad tears are watery. It depends on the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.<br/>
I wonder which kind of tears all of you would shed? Hmmmmmmm…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was sunny, so the guy who's afraid of cats was by the river.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00113.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Ailurophobe:</b> Y'know, those creepy eyes! All muddied! Looking this way! And those scales!<br/>
U-Uhh… Is there some kind of cute fish?<br/>
&gt; The man wants a cute fish.<br/>
&gt; Maybe he'll think a Red Goldfish is cute…<br/>
<b>Ailurophobe:</b> Wh-What is that!? I-It's so cute!<br/>
Give that to me! I'll use it to ambush that cat!<br/>
&gt; The man stole your Red Goldfish.<br/>
&gt; The man ran off…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided to help out at the daycare center again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00131.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Yuuta:</b> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Eri.png"/> Where do you want to eat dinner? We can go somewhere expensive if you want.<br/>
<b>Yuuta:</b> …I'm not hungry.<br/>
I'm gonna play more!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Eri.png"/> …I'll come later next time.<br/>
I even left in the middle of a show just to be on time… I'm getting fed up with this treatment.<br/>
*sigh *<br/>
I should have known better than to try. We're not related, so there's nothing I can do about it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Souji.png"/> So, you can't love Yuuta?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Eri.png"/> ……<br/>
&gt; Eri is remaining silent…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Eri.png"/> They say when a woman starts breast-feeing, her maternal instincts awaken.<br/>
…It's true, I saw it on television.<br/>
So, my maternal instinct towards him is shut away, especially since I've only known him for six months.<br/>
There's nothing I can do… Fate has determined that we'll be forever distant.<br/>
Speaking of fate, have you heard this?<br/>
Your entire life is determined from before you were even born.<br/>
We're just little robots following the program our creator made for us.<br/>
So, whenever anything happens, there's nothing you can do about it… It was already decided for you.<br/>
Doesn't that make you feel better? Isn't that a wonderful idea?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I would have said fate was bullshit before all this started but there's been way too much coincidence for it to all be chance.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00152.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Eri.png"/> Amazing, isn't it?<br/>
I saw it on TV. I was so intrigued, I went to see a lecture by that speaker, too.<br/>
I was moved to tears… I was so relieved to know that there's a higher power!<br/>
&gt; Eri's eyes are glittering…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Eri.png"/> There really isn't much to do when you live this far away from the city… All I have is TV and the internet.<br/>
You can buy things over the net now! It's much more convenient. In fact, I'm having trouble staying in shape.<br/>
Honestly, though… I just want to go back to the city.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Souji.png"/> Just let it go.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Eri.png"/> Yeah… I gave up on that a long time ago.<br/>
&gt; Eri is smiling wryly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Eri.png"/> …I really tell you a lot of personal things.<br/>
Please, don't tell Yuu-kun… Or the other mothers.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Souji.png"/> I won't.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Eri.png"/> …Thank you, Mister Souji.<br/>
&gt; Eri looks relieved.<br/>
&gt; You felt Eri opening up to you out of a deep loneliness…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I hope she someday learns to be happy with how her life is.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00169.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Eri.png"/> …Oh my, look at the time! I'm sorry, Mister Souji.<br/>
I'll take Yuu-kun home now.<br/>
&gt; The two left abruptly and awkwardly.<br/>
&gt; You decided to go home as well.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think it's going to start raining soon, and the Fog will probably come soon after. Hopefully Naoto will be feeling better soon. We're sort of stuck without her right now.</i>
