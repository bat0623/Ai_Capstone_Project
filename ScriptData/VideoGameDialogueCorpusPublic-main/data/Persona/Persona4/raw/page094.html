<br/>
&gt; …Of course, if you look only at the circumstances, you can't completely rule out that possibility.<br/>
&gt; Adachi may have been able to keep an eye on your actions.<br/>
&gt; He would have been able to approach your house with ease, and he knows the area well…<br/>
&gt; Thinking about it, you encountered him many times while investigating the case…<br/>
&gt; You learned much about the police's movements from Adachi as well…<br/>
&gt; There is no exact reason to doubt him… but…<br/>
&gt; Something is bothering you…<br/>
&gt; You spoke Adachi's name…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Huh…? What about him?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> Detective Adachi…<br/>
……<br/>
A member of the police force… That is an interesting approach.<br/>
It would certainly explain the lack of witness reports…<br/>
It's the same reason no one ever reported seeing Namatame's truck.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> This is a small town, so everyone must've known who he is.<br/>
And since he's a detective, people definitely wouldn't have thought of him as being suspicious.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> In fact, he could use his position to his advantage and hide critical information.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Huh… Well, if you think of it that way, I guess it's possible…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke did raise a valid objection.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I mean really, Adachi? He's your textbook lousy detective…<br/>
Are we really on the right track here…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> Actually… regarding Detective Adachi…<br/>
I'm not sure how to put it, but there's something that's been bothering me about him for some time now…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah? Hmm…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> Perhaps it's just my imagination, so I shouldn't speak too-<br/>
Achoo!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Whew, it's cold! I think we've cooled down enough here… Let's go back in.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We went in and told everyone else what we were thinking.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> That can't be… I mean, he said he came to escort Ms. Yamano and…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> What…? Was he at your inn when the announcer was staying there?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> When Ms. Yamano was staying at our inn, the media were swarming all over it.<br/>
That's when Adachi-san arrived, saying he had been assigned to guard her… He told our waitress that fame could be rough…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> Guard her…?<br/>
He didn't spend the night there?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Chie.png"/> Huh…<br/>
I wonder if he knew Ms. Yamano…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> I dunno about that, but I heard he did call out a girl in my class.<br/>
I found out this afternoon.<br/>
But I thought, y'know, that's just how cops are, so I didn't think it had anything to do with the case…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> Detective Adachi also questioned Saki-san, the one who found the announcer's body, on numerous occasions.<br/>
I heard it was because there was so little information about the case at the time, but…<br/>
It's certainly unusual to question someone with as strong an alibi as hers multiple times…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Chie.png"/> Then you think he had something else on his mind?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> And that "something" is what connects those two victims to Adachi-san…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>If we'd just stopped to think things through, we'd have seen this so much sooner.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> And every time, he'd tell us what the police were doing before saying, "Oops, I said too much," and clamming up.<br/>
Was that all to throw us off the trail…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> It would be no problem for him to drop that warning letter into your mailbox, either…<br/>
Not to mention the fact that he can destroy any evidence that might point to him.<br/>
&gt; Various peculiarities have begun to cast a suspicious shadow on Adachi…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> Then… is it really Adachi-san…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Souji.png"/> We need to confirm this.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> This is still only a tentative theory. We should work to confirm it as soon as possible.<br/>
This is Naoto Shirogane.<br/>
Something has occurred to me about the case, and I'd like to get Detective Adachi's input on it…<br/>
Hm…? The transport? It's right now!?<br/>
Right, I-I see… Thank you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Chie.png"/> What was that about a transport…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> Detective Adachi is headed to the hospital to prepare for Namatame's relocation.<br/>
We must head there at once!<br/>
&gt; Things are moving quickly now…<br/>
&gt; You feel that you are getting closer to the truth…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We were going to need a lot more to prove for sure that it was Adachi, though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>We rushed to the hospital, where we found Adachi pretty quickly.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Adachi.png"/> Hey, do you know where Dojima-san went? They told me he snuck out of his room again…<br/>
<b>Nurse:</b> I assure you, we've made it clear to him several times that he needs to stay put, but he keeps going off on his own…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Adachi.png"/> Geez… With Namatame finally relocated, I was looking forward to going home…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> So… he's been relocated.<br/>
I've been wondering… You seem to be in a terrible hurry to get him out of this hospital.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Adachi.png"/> Huh? Oh, well, yeah.<br/>
I mean, we can't leave him here with Dojima-san and Nanako-chan around…<br/>
Didn't you guys think so too?<br/>
Hey, what are you doing here, anyway? Nanako-chan's room is in the other wing?<br/>
Don't you think you should leave before Dojima-san finds you? If he catches you, he'll start pestering you again.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> Adachi… Where's Namatame?<br/>
There's been a lot of noise today for some reason…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Adachi.png"/> D-Dojima-san! What're you doing here!?<br/>
Namatame's already been relocated. I was looking for you so I could tell you that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> You did what!?<br/>
Who authorized that!? There's still more I need to ask him about!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Adachi.png"/> G-Gimme a break, D-Dojima-san!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dojima had been thinking things over too.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00084.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> His motives are shaky, and his alibi is rock solid.<br/>
We closed a lot of loopholes on the basis of his testimony, but that part's still nagging at me…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Adachi.png"/> Is this more of your "detective's intuition"?<br/>
He's already been relocated… It's no use hassling me about it.<br/>
And you kids should really get home, too. You're gonna get in the way of police business.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> What's gotten into you today…? It's odd to see you taking work so seriously…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Adachi.png"/> C-C'mon, I'm always giving 110% when it comes to the job!<br/>
You should get back to work too, Dojima-san. Your current assignment: Get better as soon as possible!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> ……<br/>
What are you all doing here?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> We came to confirm something… with Adachi-san.<br/>
&gt; You should question Adachi…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean if he was really at the Amagi Inn when Ms. Yamano vanished, that's strike one.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00097.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Adachi.png"/> The time the announcer went missing…?<br/>
I can't say for sure offhand… It's not like I saw her or anything.<br/>
That was months and months ago, too. My memory's kinda hazy that far back…<br/>
&gt; You should question Adachi…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And if he was really bringing Saki in for questioning more than he needed to, that's strike two.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00102.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Adachi.png"/> Why wouldn't I question her? She discovered the announcer's body.<br/>
But she didn't know much about it, so I only talked with her once or twice.<br/>
Was that all you wanted to ask? Well, I hope it helped.<br/>
&gt; There is still something you need to question Adachi about…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Then I asked the real winner.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00107.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Adachi.png"/> Warning letter?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> The one that was delivered to his house. It's in police custody now, correct?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Adachi.png"/> Uhh… I don't really remember.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> Hey, whaddya mean you don't remember?<br/>
I gave it to you to take down to the crime lab for processing. You're telling me you forgot!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Adachi.png"/> Ha… haha, I'm sorry…<br/>
Your accident was right after that, and what with one thing and another, it sorta slipped my mind…<br/>
B-Besides, that thing was just a prank, wasn't it?<br/>
Geez, what're you asking me all this for!?<br/>
For crying out loud, what's this all supposed to be about!?<br/>
Dojima-san, you really need to get back to your bed. That's why your wounds aren't healing.<br/>
And you all need to go home right now! Do you have any idea what time it is!?<br/>
I'm going back… I need to get to the station and report in.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> Just one more thing, please.<br/>
We know for certain now that the first two murders weren't Namatame's doing.<br/>
Someone else killed them.<br/>
Adachi-san… Do you have any idea who that might be?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Adachi.png"/> I-I have no idea what you're talking about…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> 'Cause we think it mighta been you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Adachi.png"/> What!? Th-That's ridiculous!<br/>
<br/>
<i>And that's when he struck out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00128.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Chie.png"/> What did you just say…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> Put them all in…?<br/>
What's this "putting them in" business?<br/>
Do you know something about the method behind their murders…?<br/>
Don't tell me that all that talk about TVs and whatnot from before was…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> I see… Now I finally understand.<br/>
To tell the truth, Adachi-san, I've been fixated on something you once said.<br/>
Before, I didn't know why… Only that it sounded a wrong note to me.<br/>
Do you recall when I read Namatame's diary at the scene of Dojima-san's accident?<br/>
At the time, I said, "Even the victims who survived and were never released to the public are written here."<br/>
And in response, your words were, "Wow… Then that settles it."<br/>
How, I wonder, would that "settle" anything?<br/>
At the time, the police had no idea that there had been other attempted murders related to the case…<br/>
You had no reason to say such a thing.<br/>
After all, there are countless examples of people disappearing for a few days…<br/>
Yet when I read the list of names, you raised no objection. Odd, that.<br/>
What do you say to that, Detective Adachi?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Adachi.png"/> I-I don't know!<br/>
I-I said I'm busy…!<br/>
<br/>
<i>And Adachi charged through before we could stop him!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00148.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> Adachi… Ngh… Dammit…<br/>
Adachi!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We lost track of Adachi around Namatame's former room.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00151.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Adachi isn't here either…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> What the…!? I swear he ran this way…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> Dammit… Where the hell'd he go?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> Did you find him…?<br/>
I contacted security… Nobody's seen Adachi, and there's no record of anyone leaving this area.<br/>
So he must be still in this ward somewhere…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Chie.png"/> He's still here…? But we looked… We didn't find him anywhere…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> That bastard…<br/>
Ungh…<br/>
<b>Nurse:</b> Dojima-san!<br/>
For heaven's sake, what are we going to do with you…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> Sorry. I got carried away…<br/>
<b>Nurse:</b> Do you even want to get better!? If you keep this up, there could be lasting damages!<br/>
Have you forgotten how much trouble it caused you last time!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> You're right… Sorry…<br/>
You've got to find Adachi. I need to square this away with him… Please.<br/>
<br/>
<i>There was only one place he could have gone.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00169.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Chie.png"/> Yeah, I think so.<br/>
If he's the killer, he can go through, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> You mean he went in through here?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> We searched every inch in the direction he ran off… There's nowhere to hide. I don't think we coulda missed him.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> He was cornered… It's highly probable that he escaped there.<br/>
If he does indeed turn up on the other side, hat should prove beyond a doubt that he is the true culprit.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> Damn, so I guess we were right… What do we do now?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Souji.png"/> Let's go tomorrow.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> I think it's too dangerous to go in from here.<br/>
We're not 100% positive he used this TV, and on top of that, we don't know where it might lead.<br/>
Let's go in from Junes, like always.<br/>
It'll be fine. So long as we're ready for him, we'll crush that jerk in one strike.<br/>
&gt; The extremely suspicious detective, Adachi…<br/>
&gt; You've taken another step towards the truth…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I still can't quite believe it, but one thing's for sure: Adachi's the real killer.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00184.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You split up for today and you all went back home…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We're getting together tomorrow to try and track him down. Hopefully we can bring an end to this soon.</i><br/>
