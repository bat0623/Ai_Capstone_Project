<i>I found that cat freak again.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Ailurophobe:</b> Oh, er, sorry… I just can't stay calm when it comes to those damn cats…<br/>
…I-I have an idea…<br/>
Do you know what cats like to eat?<br/>
If I can sneak up and slowly touch them while they're chowing down on food, I'd be in control, right?<br/>
B-But…<br/>
To tell you the truth… I'm also… scared of fish!<br/>
Y'know, those creepy eyes! All muddied! Looking this way! And those scales!<br/>
U-Uhh… Is there some kind of cute fish?<br/>
*sigh * I guess it's just a fact of life… There's no such thing as a cute fish.<br/>
That must be why they live in the water, away from human sight…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'll have to go fishing soon, I think I can find something that'll work for him. Anyway, Kanji was around as well, he was looking for something by the river.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kanji.png"/> I can't get this place outta my head.<br/>
I keep wonderin' if that rabbit the kid tossed out mighta washed ashore around here…<br/>
If he finds it now, he'll just feel bad.<br/>
…Not that I'm wading in today or anything.<br/>
<b>Boy's Voice:</b> Hey, Mister!!<br/>
<b>Doll Boy:</b> There you are!<br/>
Sana-chan was really happy!! I've been looking for you ever since!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kanji.png"/> Look, kid, quit callin'…<br/>
Ah, forget it.<br/>
<b>Doll Boy:</b> Can you make some more, Mister? My mom really wants one!<br/>
Sana-chan's mom does too! They said they'll pay you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kanji.png"/> Pay me!?<br/>
I don't need that… I-it ain't like I'm a pro at this.<br/>
<b>Doll Boy:</b> My mom wants a cat, and Sana-chan's mom wants a dog.<br/>
And my teacher wants a pink alligator.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I heard there's some really sad story behind that book. Like, it was written by some dying guy and dedicated to some teenager he made friends with who died. Name's on the tip of my tongue, something with an 'm' I think?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kanji.png"/> F-Fine, then… I'll get around to it sometime.<br/>
<b>Doll Boy:</b> Yay! Thank you! Remember, you promised!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kanji.png"/> Strange situation I got myself into, ain't it?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think he should be happy that people appreciate what he'd always thought was a curse. I'm not sure he really is, though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kanji.png"/> Good…? I don't really know.<br/>
&gt; Kanji is tilting his head…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kanji.png"/> When I was in elementary school, I fixed a classmate's bag this one time.<br/>
Thinking back… I guess I liked her.<br/>
I only did it to make her happy, but… The next day, all the girls were makin' fun of us.<br/>
…She cried.<br/>
I didn't understand why, but y'know… I thought I'd done something wrong.<br/>
So I never thought… I'd be thanked for doing this stuff.<br/>
Haha, it feels good.<br/>
Hearin' "thank you"… I like it!<br/>
&gt; Kanji is laughing sheepishly…<br/>
&gt; You feel you understand Kanji even better…<br/>
<br/>
<i>But maybe I'm wrong.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kanji.png"/> Oh… Well, I gotta jet.<br/>
I have to go to Okina Station.<br/>
To the, uh… f-fabric shop. I'm outta material, so…<br/>
L-Later!<br/>
&gt; You watched Kanji go and went home.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>Rise and I went to Okina for a bit, we got some of that shopping she'd wanted to do last time done. Also, I think Sayoko's not doing too well.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Tired Nurse:</b> Uh, which room was it again? The one with the patient Uehara-san mentioned.<br/>
<b>Pale Nurse:</b> What!? You'd better get going now, or she'll yell at you!<br/>
<b>Tired Nurse:</b> She's been really scary lately…<br/>
<b>Pale Nurse:</b> She's been trying too… Ah!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sayoko.png"/> If you have time to chat, you have time to go check on all the patients.<br/>
Nakata-san, Room 512! Did you finish disimpacting the patient?<br/>
<b>Tired Nurse:</b> I… I was just about to go…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sayoko.png"/> I see you're skilled at slacking off.<br/>
Takahashi-san, the equipment order form wasn't filled out properly. In several places.<br/>
<b>Pale Nurse:</b> I-I-I'm sorry, I'll fix it right-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sayoko.png"/> I've already fixed it and sent it in!<br/>
Just go.<br/>
Souji-kun… I see you're working. That's good.<br/>
I'll be going, then…<br/>
&gt; Sayoko looks a bit pale. She also seems to be very tired.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't think she'd listen even if I did tell her she should take it easy, this is something she's got to work out for herself.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sayoko.png"/> Right, I can still work.<br/>
&gt; Sayoko smiles awkwardly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sayoko.png"/> Yep… Very nice and clean.<br/>
I like you because you don't slack off.<br/>
&gt; Sayoko praised your work ethic…<br/>
&gt; You feel that Sayoko trusts you.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I just hope she does before something bad happens to her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00077.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sayoko.png"/> …Oh, I don't have time to hang around here, either. It's going to be another all-nighter for me…<br/>
…Goodbye.<br/>
&gt; You finished your job and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>The forecast calls for rain soon. Will the fog come again?</i>
