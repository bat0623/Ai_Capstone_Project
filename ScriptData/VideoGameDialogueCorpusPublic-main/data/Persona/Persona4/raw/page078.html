			<b>11/3/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>Had the day off today, but it was raining, which always sucks. I decided to go make the fox's rainy day a little better by telling it about the woman's wallet.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>The rain stopped by nightfall, so I decided to head out to work at the hospital. Sayoko was waiting for me, she had something important to tell me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Sayoko asked you to come here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Sayoko.png"/> I'm sorry. You're already done with work today, aren't you?<br/>
I wanted to say goodbye.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> Goodbye?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Sayoko.png"/> …I'm leaving this hospital today.<br/>
&gt; Sayoko looks straight into your eyes.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Sayoko.png"/> I grew to hate hospitals…<br/>
All the life and death… In the end everyone leaves, leaving me behind.<br/>
I was lonely…<br/>
Then I remembered.<br/>
I remembered that… I wanted to help. I became a nurse because I wanted to save people's lives.<br/>
I couldn't see that it was as simple as that…<br/>
No… I probably didn't want to see it.<br/>
&gt; Sayoko smiles gently…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Sayoko.png"/> And to think that the one who would show me this is just some kind with a rag in his hand.<br/>
…I tend to go for older rich men, and I landed a child.<br/>
So… I'm going.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was pretty shocked.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Sayoko.png"/> I'm going to be my own guide. Thinking, walking, taking responsibility for myself…<br/>
Once I've done all that, I think I can finally say that I've truly lived.<br/>
……<br/>
Will you take this?<br/>
&gt; Sayoko gave you Hospital ID.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Sayoko.png"/> I give you the person I was when I was here.<br/>
&gt; Sayoko looks at you gently…<br/>
&gt; You feel a strong bond between Sayoko and yourself…<br/>
<br/>
<i>But for the first time she really seemed happy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>For once she was actually doing what she wanted, not going through the motions.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Sayoko.png"/> I'm going to say this. It's as much to myself as it is to you.<br/>
What's right… What you should choose to do in life… The answers to those things lie within you.<br/>
Now… So long.<br/>
&gt; Sayoko left, never looking back.<br/>
&gt; …You decided to go home.<br/>
<br/>
<b>11/4/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Tonight was finally the night.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Kanji.png"/> Been a while since it rained last, hasn't it?<br/>
The weather report says this rain's gonna last all night.<br/>
We're gonna have to watch the Midnight Channel.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> You're right.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Kanji.png"/> Only we know that the real killer is still out there, right?<br/>
Now that I think about it, we have to be even tougher now that the cops aren't on the case…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Mr. Hosoi is so strange.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Hosoi:</b> You've gotta watch out for seasonal changes. I guess the fog made it that much worse this year.<br/>
Seriously, catching a cold is just dreadful. I have it worse than most of you; my moustache is such a pain…<br/>
…I apologize in advance if I mention anything too gross.<br/>
…Did I hear someone say I should just shave it off? I won't do that, and for a good reason.<br/>
Did you know that facial hair plays an important role for your body? Hana-chan!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yosuke.png"/> Huh…? Wh-What? Facial hair…?<br/>
My bad, Souji. I wasn't paying attention…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm still not sure why shaving it off would hurt this at all.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Hosoi:</b> Yup, you're right! I knew you'd get it, Hana-chan!<br/>
Facial hair excretes the accumulated toxic substances out of your body. Your hair does the same.<br/>
So when you guys are able to grow one, I want you all to take good care of your moustaches, alright?<br/>
…In fact, I think I'll put this on the test.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yosuke.png"/> I think this is the most energetic I've ever seen this guy…<br/>
…Anyway, thanks.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It seems rumors about the fog are starting to spread.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Attendant:</b> Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?<br/>
I feel very relaxed on rainy and foggy days… It seems the everyday noise just fades away.<br/>
Don't you think so too?<br/>
<br/>
<i>It is sort of nice sometimes. Anyway, I went to the shrine to see if the fox had another request for me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00076.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>The Samegawa made me think of that old guy who loves to fish down there, and sure enough that was who made the wish.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Old Man:</b> …You know what I'm talkin' about, right? Samegawa has a Guardian in the river.<br/>
I've only seen him once, when I was younger…<br/>
I felt a tug I'd never felt before, and when I pulled…<br/>
He was huge! Not only that, but there was this godly aura around him…<br/>
I fought him for hours, but I lost 'im. No… I know he was just toying with me.<br/>
I kept on fishin' for years and years, just hoping to catch a glimpse of him one more time, but…<br/>
I'm an old man, and the strength is gone from these arms… Maybe it's time to hang up my rod for good.<br/>
…I just want to see him with my own two eyes one more time before I go to the big bait shop in the sky.<br/>
Then, I wouldn't have any regrets…<br/>
&gt; The old fisherman looks off into the distance…<br/>
&gt; …Perhaps he is the one who wrote that ema fox showed you.<br/>
&gt; He wants to see the Guardian of Samegawa one more time…<br/>
<b>Old Man:</b> *sigh *<br/>
Are there any skilled young fishermen out there…?<br/>
&gt; The old man glances in your direction…<br/>
&gt; If you bring him a big fish, perhaps he would accept you…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Of course a while back I'd caught that horrible dragon monster in the river, which seemed to impress him.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00096.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Old Man:</b> That Huge Fish you got there… It's not bad…<br/>
…Will you listen to my final wish?<br/>
Your skill, your eyes… I want to see you give it a try.<br/>
I want you to land the Guardian! You can do it!<br/>
…Please! This old man's beggin' you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> I'll catch the Guardian.<br/>
<b>Old Man:</b> I see…! I see, I see!<br/>
Alright, I'll give you this! My Angler's Set.<br/>
I carved this rod by hand, with all my fishin' spirit. If anything can catch the Guardian, it's this.<br/>
…Oh, and try it on rainy days. It'll be harder for the fish to notice your presence when it's raining.<br/>
And, this is my ultimate fishin' advice! Listen close, because I ain't gonna repeat myself.<br/>
If you start pullin' when a fish pokes the bait, the fish'll run away, right?<br/>
So… if you don't want to catch that fish, pull the bait away before it bites!<br/>
You'll keep your bait, and the fish you don't want will swim away. Just keep repeating that… You get my drift?<br/>
I'm counting on you!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I sat there for what felt like days, pulling my line back from the light nibbles. Then, suddenly, I felt an almighty tug. After a brutal battle, I pulled ashore the great fish responsible.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00112.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Old Man:</b> Ooooh!!<br/>
Th-Th-That… That must be!<br/>
*cough * *cough *<br/>
*pant * *pant *<br/>
*sigh * You scared me. I thought I was gonna die…<br/>
So, that thing you've got there must be the Guardian…<br/>
Congratulations, youngster!!<br/>
I… I don't have any more regrets… Now I can live out the rest of my life in peace…<br/>
……<br/>
YEAH RIGHT! I'm gonna fish! You hear me!? I'm going to FISH!<br/>
Ya brat! Why don't we have a competition, eh!? Wahahaha!<br/>
&gt; You accomplished the request written on the ema!<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was getting cold as I got home.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Nanako.png"/> Did he forget his keys?<br/>
It was the deliveryman. He was asking where Mr. Takahashi's house is…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Just then we got a call.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00131.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Nanako.png"/> Oh, hi Dad!<br/>
Uh-huh… All right. It's okay, I know it's your job.<br/>
Uh-huh… Uh-huh. Big bro's with me, so… Okay, byebye.<br/>
Dad says he's coming home tomorrow.<br/>
But I'm not lonely… You're here with me.<br/>
&gt; Nanako is smiling cheerfully…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Nanako.png"/> It's cold today too…<br/>
Wanna bring out the kotatsu?<br/>
Dad said we could pull it out if it got too cold.<br/>
That'll make it nice and warm!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We pulled it out, but were disappointed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Nanako.png"/> Okay, I'm turning it on.<br/>
What…? It's not coming on. Looks like it's broken.<br/>
&gt; Nanako is disappointed…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> Let's get the best one.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Nanako.png"/> Huh? We can buy one? At Junes?<br/>
Yaaay! When you have some time, let's go to Junes!<br/>
&gt; You promised to go shopping with Nanako.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I put Nanako to bed later, and waited for the Midnight Channel. I have no idea who it could have been though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00152.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; …It's a silhouette!<br/>
&gt; But it looks even blurrier than usual… You can't even tell what gender the person is…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, did you see that!?<br/>
It was really blurry, but you saw someone on the screen, right?<br/>
Dammit… Is there gonna be another kidnapping…?<br/>
Let's get together as soon as we can tomorrow.<br/>
The one just now was too blurry to jump to any conclusions.<br/>
But maybe someone has an idea of who it might be… We definitely need to talk.<br/>
Just remember to keep your schedule open tomorrow after school.<br/>
&gt; Yosuke hung up.<br/>
&gt; …You decide to go to bed.<br/>
<br/>
<i>How can we protect someone when we don't know who they are?</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>11/5/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Where do I start on this? Okay, okay, how did we get to this point. That's a good place. We got together to talk about what we'd seen on the Midnight Channel after school.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Naoto.png"/> To think a master of deduction and evidence would strain her eyes over an urban legend like this…<br/>
And yet… I definitely saw someone.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yosuke.png"/> Could any of you tell who it was?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Kanji.png"/> From a fuzzy picture like that? No way.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yukiko.png"/> How about the regular TV? Has anyone become famous around here lately?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Naoto.png"/> I can't think of any offhand…<br/>
I suppose these was that politician who visited to quell the rumors about the fog. His statement was read on TV…<br/>
But the chances of him being the one are slim. He returned immediately to the city after his inquiry.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Teddie.png"/> Hrmmm…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yosuke.png"/> Hm? What's the matter?<br/>
Oh yeah, they stuck you with the midnight shift for falling asleep on the beds in housewares.<br/>
I told you to use the TV in the electronics department, right? Did you remember to check it out?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Teddie.png"/> How rude! I made a promise with Nanako-chan and I'm serious about living!<br/>
From what I saw… wasn't the person on TV last night pretty small?<br/>
<br/>
<i>None of us were quite sure what we'd seen.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00179.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Chie.png"/> It was probably just a dream or  your imagination.<br/>
Either way, though, did you sense anyone in that world?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Teddie.png"/> Nope. No one's come so far.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Rise.png"/> Then we might have to wait one more night and see…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, I guess so…<br/>
Good thing it looks like the rain'll keep up all night. Don't forget to check again later on.<br/>
<br/>
<i>When Dojima got in, he had a letter in his hands. That was where things started to go wrong.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00186.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Nanako.png"/> Welcome back!<br/>
Dad, the kotatsu's broken. Can me and big bro go buy a new one?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Dojima.png"/> The kotatsu…? Ahh, it's already that season, huh? Yeah, the weather has been odd lately…<br/>
All right, I'll leave it up to you. Get whichever kind you want.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Nanako.png"/> Is that a letter?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Dojima.png"/> It's for you, but…<br/>
&gt; The letter is addressed to "Mr. Souji Seta"…<br/>
&gt; But the name and address of the sender are nowhere to be found…<br/>
&gt; There are no stamps or postmarks on it…<br/>
&gt; There is only one sentence…<br/>
<b>The Letter:</b> "if you dont stop this time someone close will be put in and killed"<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; Could he have sent another warning because another person appeared on the Midnight Channel…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dojima saw it and snatched it from my hand.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00200.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Dojima.png"/> Not often we get letters with no return address on them.<br/>
So I was right…<br/>
Be straight with me… You're involved in the case, aren't you?<br/>
What are you up to?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I tried to get out of it again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00205.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You decided to make up an excuse…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Dojima.png"/> So you're not going to be honest with me.<br/>
I've been treating you like family… That's why I never questioned you on this.<br/>
But I see that was a mistake… I should've intervened much earlier because I care for you.<br/>
I will have the truth from you today.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Nanako.png"/> D-Dad…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Dojima.png"/> We'll continue this somewhere else. But I'm not letting you leave until I'm convinced.<br/>
This is for your own good… Got that?<br/>
It's alright. We're not fighting.<br/>
We'll be right back, so don't wait up for us to get to bed… Okay?<br/>
&gt; Nanako is scared…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> We'll be back soon.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Nanako.png"/> Okay… I'll be waiting.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&gt; He took away your cell…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Dojima.png"/> Now speak up. What have you gotten yourself into?<br/>
What was that warning letter about? Why would you be sent something like that?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided there was no point trying to hide what we were up to anymore, Dojima clearly wasn't buying the excuses.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-P4-00225.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; …You decide to explain everything to him.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Dojima.png"/> Persona…?<br/>
People going inside a TV!?<br/>
……<br/>
I thought you'd finally tell me what's really going on here…<br/>
Enough! That's enough.<br/>
…I guess half a year wasn't long enough for you to trust me like your old man…<br/>
But I hoped you'd open up to me a little…<br/>
*sigh * It's a shame.<br/>
…Stay here for the night.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Adachi.png"/> Whoa… Sorry!<br/>
Dang…<br/>
Go inside TVs… and Persona, huh…? Well, you can't blame him…<br/>
I mean, sure, I want to believe you.<br/>
And I know Dojima-san brought you here and asked those questions because he wants to believe you too.<br/>
Plus, you know, you'll be safe here.<br/>
He probably freaked out once he saw that letter and though he had to protect you.<br/>
Like what a father would do for his son. I think he cares for you a lot.<br/>
So yeah, don't take it so hard!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Adachi had a good explanation of the real source of this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-P4-00245.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Adachi.png"/> Guess he wasn't satisfied with the way the case wrapped up after all.<br/>
That's why he's even more sensitive about this and that-<br/>
A-Ahaha! I better shut up now before I get chewed out again.<br/>
Alright, I'll be just outside. If you need anything, let me know.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Meanwhile…</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-P4-00251.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Teddie2.png"/> It's because I'm not working hard enough! There's no getting around it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yosuke.png"/> And you're proud of that because…?<br/>
Why am I taking care of you anyways…? *sigh * I shouldn't have bought you this…<br/>
Hang onto it, okay? It's your own cell.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Teddie2.png"/> I-I've entered the information age!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yosuke.png"/> We'd get worried if we couldn't reach you.<br/>
It's just a cheap kid's model, though.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Teddie2.png"/> Th… Th-Thank you, Yosuke…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yosuke.png"/> So, to use it, press this button…<br/>
Uhh, scrap that. Watch, I'll show you how I use mine.<br/>
He's not picking up…<br/>
It's raining right now, so I was gonna remind him about the Midnight Channel…<br/>
Does he not hear it because he's out?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Teddie2.png"/> I wanna go to Nana-chan's place! I promised to play with her lots!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yosuke.png"/> We're not going. And go put those snacks back.<br/>
It's already dinnertime, so save 'em for your next visit.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-P4-00268.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Teddie2.png"/> I feel bad to think of her staying home all alone!<br/>
We could go take her some dinner! Please please please please!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yosuke.png"/> Okay okay, I hear you! Geez…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Teddie2.png"/> So we can go!?<br/>
Sweet! You're so mature, Yosuke! My heart just skipped a beat because of your thoughtfulness.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yosuke.png"/> Hang on a sec, I'll try calling again.<br/>
He's still not picking up…<br/>
Oh, duh. I forgot to try his home line…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Nanako.png"/> Hello…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, Nanako-chan.<br/>
Um, is your brother home?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Nanako.png"/> No.<br/>
He got a weird letter, and Dad saw it and got angry…<br/>
He took big bro to the police station…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yosuke.png"/> W-Wait, what!? He got taken to the police station!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Teddie2.png"/> Stop blabbering and let me talk too!<br/>
Good evening, this is your Teddie speaking.<br/>
Let's get together and eat snacks again!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-P4-00287.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Teddie2.png"/> We'll go check up on your brother and dad.<br/>
So don't worry, okay?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yosuke.png"/> Wait, was it another warning letter!? Did he get a second one!?<br/>
And Dojima-san saw that, so… he took him to the station?<br/>
Teddie, gimme the phone back! I need to call the others!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was stuck in the station with no hope of getting out anytime soon.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-P4-00294.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; …It's midnight.<br/>
&gt; It was raining outside when you got here…<br/>
&gt; Something may appear on the Midnight Channel…<br/>
<br/>
<i>How could I not recognize who was on it?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-P4-00298.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It's blurry, but you can see a small silhouette…<br/>
