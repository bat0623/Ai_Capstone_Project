<i>Not much going on today.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kashiwagi.png"/> Robert Koch discovered tuberculosis. Koch, cough, doesn't it sound similar? *giggle *<br/>
He's one of the best examples I know… But you guys all know someone like that, right?<br/>
In fact, there's someone here at school who might fit that bill… But don't try to find out who, okay? That's a no-no.<br/>
This one time, that teacher, Mrs. Nakayama, was… Huh? What's the matter, Souji-kun?<br/>
Aww, please, don't look so bored, silly. We're in class right now.<br/>
So, who's the one that discovered the mycobacterium, tuberculosis?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was actually sort of preoccupied but I had been sort of listening luckily.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kashiwagi.png"/> Good job, you got it right! I'm glad you remembered it.<br/>
*giggle * Earnest boys make my heart beat faster.<br/>
Alright, let's continue. Louis Pasteur is a researcher just as renowned as Koch.<br/>
These two are known as the pioneers of modern bacteriology, and they made many discoveries…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nobody was around after school, can't say that I blame them. We'd picked up a bunch of junk in the TV world, and while I was talking to Daidara I found out he had something else I was looking for.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Daidara.png"/> I found these strange letters in with what I bought. They're love letters! Don't you think it's strange?<br/>
Throwing them away is a bit cold… And returning them to their owner is also kind of an admission of reading them…<br/>
&gt; Are these the letters that Hisano had told you about before…?<br/>
&gt; You asked Daidara for the letters he found.<br/>
&gt; Received Husband's Letters.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I went down to the shrine to tell the fox I'd caught that guy's big fish.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yeah that's right the fox is messing with me or something. I just can't win lately it seems.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>11/12/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I ran into Kanji, he wanted to talk to me about something so we headed up to the hill.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> The other day… I went to visit Dad's grave.<br/>
It's the first time I went on my own… Well, I had a lot to tell him.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Souji.png"/> How was it?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> H-How was it…? Well… uhh…<br/>
I felt like I could finally face him.<br/>
…A little late, though.<br/>
&gt; Kanji is smiling sadly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> Dad told me somethin' right before he died: "If you're a man, you have to become strong."<br/>
I felt like he was telling me I wasn't a real man. Pissed me off.<br/>
So, I changed my looks and pushed myself away from people…<br/>
Fighting gangs, thinking I was protecting Ma… Tryin' to catch this killer…<br/>
I thought all that was how I was becoming strong.<br/>
That I was really making up for all the trouble I caused…<br/>
I was drunk off my "power"…<br/>
But… That wasn't it. That ain't what Dad meant…<br/>
I still don't really get what bein' "strong" means, but I'm gonna start by not lying to myself.<br/>
No more being scared of everyone, hiding my hobbies, staying away from people…<br/>
Anytime, anyplace, I'm gonna bust right through as my own self!<br/>
That's the way to deal with that "other me" in the TV world.<br/>
As long as there's someone like that snot-nosed kid to accept me, I ain't afraid of nothing!<br/>
<br/>
<i>At least things are going well for someone.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> Sir! It's all thanks to you!<br/>
&gt; Kanji is smiling gently…<br/>
&gt; You felt Kanji's firm resolve…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Kanji has grown yet deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think I've been pretty dumb the past few days, moping like this because she ran off.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> Oh yeah. We're gonna put those dolls of mine up for sale at the shop.<br/>
They were a big hit with that kid and his mom…<br/>
They called me just to say "thank you"… Heheh, I got a kick outta that.<br/>
Oh, I gotta go buy supplies… I need to jet.<br/>
&gt; You parted with Kanji and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I wonder if there's any other night jobs I can take, I'm really just sick to death of sitting around alone all night thinking about crap I can't change. I'll have to check tomorrow.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>11/13/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>It turned out that there was another night job that had opened up. Someone needed tutoring, which seemed right up my alley.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00086.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I had those letters for Hisano, so I headed down to talk to her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00091.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You showed Hisano the letters from her husband.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Hisano.png"/> The letters from my husband…!?<br/>
How…!?<br/>
&gt; You told her they were at Daidara.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Hisano.png"/> Oh my, it must have been when he came to collect the contents of the storehouse…<br/>
So that's where I kept the letters…<br/>
…Thank you, Souji-chan. From the bottom of this old woman's heart. I'm so happy…<br/>
&gt; Hisano is very happy…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Hisano.png"/> But I'm going to burn them.<br/>
…I'll go get some matches.<br/>
&gt; She's going to burn them…<br/>
&gt; What should you do…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Curiosity overcame me, I must admit.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00105.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You decided to read a little bit…<br/>
<b>Postcard:</b> "The wooden well frame / I was one shorter than it / I have outgrown it / in the time that we / have been kept apart"<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; That's all the postcard says…<br/>
&gt; Another postcard has a short composition on it…<br/>
<b>Postcard:</b> "I want to see you so much.<br/>
"How much sky, earth, and water do my words have to run through, on and over to reach you, my dear Hisa-san?<br/>
"How I wish I was this postcard."<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Hisano.png"/> …Isn't that just so sad?<br/>
He had no idea that he was being deceived…<br/>
I'm sure he never imagined that the "Hisa-san" he loved would some day wish to see him dead…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Hisano told me the whole thing.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00117.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Hisano.png"/> ……<br/>
He was a kind, honest, and loyal man.<br/>
…He fell ill and became bedridden. I had to work to support our family…<br/>
He would always apologize to me for failing as a husband. When he did, he would smile so sadly…<br/>
His illness worsened, and he must have been scared. He began to take his fear and frustration out on me.<br/>
The man who had been so kind…<br/>
…But that didn't bother me at all.<br/>
I had agreed that I would work and take care of him the day we were wed. "In sickness and in health…"<br/>
But he forgot.<br/>
He forgot who I was, and he forgot all about me.<br/>
I couldn't bring myself to love him. I couldn't forgive the way he would look at me with such confusion in his eyes…<br/>
And when I cried, he would wipe my tears away, like the man he had been all those years ago… I couldn't forgive that.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Why she was 'Death.'</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00130.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Hisano.png"/> But I couldn't.<br/>
While I was standing over him, he looked up… and he smiled at me. That same smile he gave me when I was a girl.<br/>
And in the same voice he would use to tell me he loved me, he asked: "Who are you, Ma'am?"<br/>
That was three years ago…<br/>
After that day, he would forget who I was every morning. Every day, he would ask me, "Who are you?"<br/>
And every day, I would answer: "Who am I today?"<br/>
I was a total stranger to him, until the very end…<br/>
He was being cared for by a stranger as he passed away.<br/>
That was his punishment. Punishment for forgetting me…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was sort of shell-shocked, I mean what do you say to something like that?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00140.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Hisano.png"/> …I was relieved.<br/>
Before I could feel anything else… I felt relief. Relief that it was finally over, for both of us.<br/>
It was then that I realized that I had been wanting him to die.<br/>
And because I wished it, he left this world and went to the gods.<br/>
…I am Death itself.<br/>
&gt; Hisano smiles sadly…<br/>
&gt; You feel that you understand Hisano a bit more…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It seems like Hisano's got nothing left but her regrets now.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00148.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Hisano.png"/> Please, throw the letters away.<br/>
I can't bear to see them anymore. I don't want to touch them anymore.<br/>
I'm sorry…<br/>
&gt; You weren't able to give Hisano back the letters from her husband.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; Perhaps you should speak with the owner of Daidara…<br/>
<br/>
<i>You know what, though? Tomorrow's a new day. And even if Naoto ends up telling me she doesn't feel the same way I do, I'm happy I told her. I at least have no regrets.</i>
