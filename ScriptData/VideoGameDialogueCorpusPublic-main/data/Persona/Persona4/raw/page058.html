<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yo.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Hey, did you see the show on TV last night? Naoto-kun was on!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> That thing about the Detective Prince solving the case? C'mon, we're the ones who actually caught the killer.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> But the police were the ones who identified the suspect, and he was cooperating with them on it, right?<br/>
So it's true he helped solve the case.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> I'm kinda surprised, though.<br/>
I didn't think he was the type to go after the spotlight like that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Naoto.png"/> Good morning.<br/>
I've been waiting for you all. There's something I needed to discuss with you regarding the case.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Discuss? Dude, we'll be late if we talk too long… Hey, where's your uniform?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Naoto.png"/> Could you please indulge my current theory on the matter?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> What is it…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Naoto.png"/> First, as regards commonalities between the victims, all of them were kidnapped before they were murdered.<br/>
The victims were all locals who had been the focus of recent media attention, becoming suddenly well-known…<br/>
That is the most likely scenario.<br/>
I don't believe there's anything intrinsically unique about the victims themselves.<br/>
…Haven't you all come to the same conclusion?<br/>
<br/>
<i>No real point lying to Naoto about this, if he's got something to say I want to hear it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Naoto.png"/> Then, allow me to state my point.<br/>
Will you admit that a number of you fit these identical circumstances?<br/>
There was a long interval between the second and third deaths in this case.<br/>
But after I applied the aforementioned criteria, I discovered several similar disappearances had taken place.<br/>
Yukiko Amagi. Kanji Tatsumi. Rise Kujikawa. All of you disappeared shortly after being shown on TV…<br/>
Either you escaped death somehow, or you faked your own disappearances in order to divert attention from yourselves…<br/>
Since some of you had ties to the victims, there came a point where I suspected one of you must be the culprit.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> You thought one of us was the killer!? You can't be serious!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Naoto.png"/> This was a prior theory, since discarded.<br/>
Putting together everything I've learned until this moment, I believe exactly the opposite.<br/>
You aren't the culprits. You may, in fact, be the only ones with the means to pursue the true perpetrator…<br/>
Seen as a joining of forces between the rescued, everything falls into place.<br/>
…Of course, this is all speculation.<br/>
There is in fact a flaw in the theory. It doesn't account for the third incident… Mr. Morooka's murder.<br/>
He has never been broadcast on television, and neither did he ever disappear. We must also consider the condition of his corpse.<br/>
The first two victims are still listed with an unknown cause of death…<br/>
But Mr. Morooka died of an easily identifiable blunt force trauma to the occipital cranium.<br/>
<br/>
<i>So that's what's bothering Naoto.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Naoto.png"/> Further action will be necessary to obtain some sort of decisive evidence.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Further action…? What do you mean?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Naoto.png"/> Well, whatever the outcome… the evidence should come to light.<br/>
…You said something interesting to me not long ago.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, where are you going?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Naoto.png"/> This is not a game for me either…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Naoto-kun…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I went to drama for a bit, it was fun but Yumi's heart really isn't in it anymore. It's going to rain tomorrow. Will the Midnight Channel air again?</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>9/14/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Everyone's talking about Naoto at school. That TV show certainly worked.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Chatty Girl:</b> Hey, did you see that show on TV? The one about the Detective Prince's secret identity?<br/>
Naoto-kun is so cool!<br/>
<b>Braided Girl:</b> Yeah, he really does have it goin' on, doesn't he…? He's really young to be a detective, too!<br/>
He's cute, but he has this aura of mystery about him… That's cool, too!<br/>
<b>Chatty Girl:</b> You think he'll be at school today!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I headed down to the shopping district, some things to do. They need to get that gas station person like a thing to stand under, this rain can't be healthy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Attendant:</b> Even on a day like this where there's not that many customers, I gotta spend it standing around…<br/>
But looking at the town puts me at ease somehow. Maybe it's because I've lived here for so long.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think Adachi's staking out the shopping district for something, maybe the police aren't totally convinced themselves.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Adachi.png"/> Well, it's a fact that he helped solve the case, so it's no surprise that he was interviewed for his contribution.<br/>
And I'd rather have people excited about things like this than all the bad news, you know.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I also decided to stop by at the shrine, let the fox know I'd finished the request. It was pretty happy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I figured I'd grab a snack before I checked the Midnight Channel. Did I mention I make really bad choices? I think I did but I just want to throw it out there again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00076.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; There's a mushroom there that you don't recognize…<br/>
&gt; …It may have grown out of something that had previously been in the fridge.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; Eat it…?<br/>
&gt; …<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; ………<br/>
&gt; It tasted fine, but you feel very itchy for a while afterwards…<br/>
&gt; Your Courage has greatly increased.<br/>
&gt; However…<br/>
&gt; You don't feel well…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You decided to go to bed early today…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I managed to stay awake long enough for midnight, though. And it seemed the Midnight Channel had continued, undaunted by Mitsuo's capture.</i><br/>

<br/>
&gt; The image is hazy… You can't tell who it is…<br/>
&gt; But… you feel like you've seen this person before somewhere…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Did you see that? Someone came on, right?<br/>
Now that the killer's been caught, do we still gotta worry about the Midnight Channel…?<br/>
But then, someone said the blurry image seemed like an advance notice…<br/>
…What exactly is the Midnight Channel anyway? Did it have anything to do with the murders?<br/>
Argh, this is so frustrating…! Hey, what do you think?<br/>
Did you recognize who appeared just now?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I wasn't positive but I had a suspicion as to who it had to be.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00102.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Naoto? Why would he show up on TV?<br/>
Now that you mention it, I wonder what he thinks about the Midnight Channel…<br/>
Ugh, I don't get this at all. It's gonna keep nagging at me, I can tell…<br/>
I'm sure the others saw it too, so let's get another tomorrow and talk about it.<br/>
'Night.<br/>
&gt; Yosuke hung up.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still, I have a bad feeling about this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>9/15/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>School was uneventful, afterwards we talked about what happened last night.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> I wonder who that was…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I talked to Teddie, and he says no one's entered the other side…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Rise.png"/> Well, yeah. The killer's been caught.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Kanji.png"/> Huh…? What's up?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> C'mon, get with the program. You saw the TV last night, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Kanji.png"/> So? 's got nothing to do with us.<br/>
The killer's behind bars, man. You guys are overreacting.<br/>
That shit Naoto said didn't make any sense either, so there's no use getting all worked up about it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Huh…? Naoto-kun?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Kanji.png"/> Uh, no, well… How do I put it…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> What, were you out of it 'cause you were still thinking about what Naoto said?<br/>
Haha, so you're still hung up on all that stuff.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Kanji.png"/> That's--! I ain't hung up on it!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> It's okay, we all understand. Just don't go overboard, man.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Kanji.png"/> You little… I said that's not it!<br/>
Tch… I got stuff to do. I'm outta here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Stop bringing that up, Yosuke… You know he doesn't think it's funny.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Rise.png"/> Ooh, what? What? Did something happen between Kanji and Naoto-kun!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukiko had something else she wanted to bring up that had been bothering her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00129.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Is it me, or does the town seem kind of strange lately?<br/>
Everyone is in high spirits, for some reason… And they all talk about other people, but never themselves.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Really? I don't think it's anything special.<br/>
Now that the murder case is solved, people feel relaxed, that's all.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Rise.png"/> That's how society is. They all just want to get in on the latest trend.<br/>
People get excited fast and lose interest even faster… It goes 'round and 'round. There's no underlying reason for it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> I don't know… It still seems a little too weird…<br/>
It's like… they're all afraid of something.<br/>
Oh… Sorry. I just had this feeling.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Huh…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> It's gonna rain again tonight.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> We should check the Midnight Channel just in case.<br/>
<br/>
<i>And when we did…</i><br/>

<br/>
&gt; It's an extremely clear image!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-NaotoShadow.png"/> Good evening, everyone. I am the Detective Prince, Naoto Shirogane.<br/>
Welcome to "Experiment of the Century: The Genome Project."<br/>
I will be experimentor and experimentee both in a forbidden yet wonderful bodily alteration process!<br/>
You shall witness my departure into a new realm… The moment of a new birth!<br/>
From the chosen day forth, I shall walk a completely different path in life…!<br/>
And I will share this glorious occasion, this memorable day, with all of you!<br/>
Do stay tuned!<br/>
&gt; That was definitely Naoto…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kanji beat Yosuke to the punch this time.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00154.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Kanji.png"/> So 's this mean he was kidnapped…?<br/>
You said people only show up clearly on TV once they're thrown into that other world, right!?<br/>
The hell's going on!? I thought we caught the damn killer!<br/>
&gt; Kanji is completely flustered.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Souji.png"/> Calm down.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Kanji.png"/> Oh, I-I'm sorry!<br/>
Being a detective, solving cases… It ain't worth shit if he gets himself kidnapped…<br/>
Damn, that idiot pisses me off!<br/>
Anyways, let's get the gang together and meet first thing after school!<br/>
&gt; …You decided to go to bed early.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Two things are certain: The killer is still at large, and we need to save Naoto.</i><br/>
