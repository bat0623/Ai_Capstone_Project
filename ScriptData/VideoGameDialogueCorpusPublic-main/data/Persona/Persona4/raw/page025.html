			<b>6/3/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>The rain's started up again. It's just great. I headed down to the shopping district, ran into that gas station attendant again. Shame they're still not hiring.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Attendant:</b> It's been like this since they built that mega-store outside town a few years back…<br/>
But lately, it's been noisy here too. I understand that everyone is afraid of the murderer, but…<br/>
…It seems they're actually excited, having something big and fresh to chat about.<br/>
Heh, am I overthinking it?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Anyway I figured the fox would like to know I'd succeeded.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Anyway, I went back to work at the hospital again earlier. That weird nurse was there too.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Sayoko.png"/> Oh, it's you, the student worker. I see you're doing your job.<br/>
I'm sorry. I haven't introduced myself.<br/>
I'm Sayoko Uehara. Nice to meet you.<br/>
&gt; The nurse seems kind…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Sayoko.png"/> When you're done here, come on by the nurse's station. I'll pour you some hot coffee.<br/>
……<br/>
…Just kidding.<br/>
I hear you're a high schooler…<br/>
Hmhm, your skin is so smooth…<br/>
Hey… You know what I'm getting at, don't you?<br/>
Don't worry, no one'll see…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean she's kinda hot and all but this is all more than a little creepy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Sayoko.png"/> ……<br/>
Oho… How adorable!<br/>
…I like you.<br/>
When's the next time you're coming? I'll adjust my shift.<br/>
Looks like even a town like this has something fun to do…<br/>
&gt; You can feel mischievous affection coming from Sayoko…<br/>
&gt; You feel a faint bond forming between yourself and Sayoko…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sigh, do I want money and supernatural power THIS bad?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Sayoko.png"/> I'll see you again.<br/>
&gt; You finished your job and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>The rain's not letting up tonight, I'm sure the fog's coming soon. Not that we've got anything to worry about.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>6/4/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I stopped by the shrine and picked up another ema request.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Think I'm looking for a child this time. I'll have to keep an eye out. Anyway, after my customary Aiya bowl celebrating our victory over the forces of supernatural evil I headed home. Seems the rains are ending tonight.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Weather Announcer:</b> The week ended on a wet note as rain clouds moved into the area.<br/>
As a result, a thick fog is expected to form in the Inaba region later tonight…<br/>
&gt; It seems the fog will set in tonight…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Also did I mention a while ago that I'm an idiot? Because I am.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Drink it…?<br/>
&gt; …<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; ………<br/>
&gt; …The milk was halfway to becoming yogurt.<br/>
&gt; Your Courage has greatly increased.<br/>
&gt; However…<br/>
&gt; You don't feel well…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You decided to go to bed early today…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Just to be safe I checked the midnight channel, but there was nothing there. Looks like once again the killer has failed. I'd sleep well tonight, you know, if I hadn't just drank a bunch of rotten milk.</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>Elsewhere…</i><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00077.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>6/5/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I was down by the river today. There was a really pathetic looking kid there, I had a hunch and guessed he might be the one from the ema.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00078.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Boy:</b> I don't have any money.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Paranoid little kid.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Boy:</b> You're not here for anything else, then, right?<br/>
I don't have any friends. So nobody ever wants to talk to me…<br/>
&gt; The boy seems sad…<br/>
&gt; He said he doesn't have any friends.<br/>
&gt; Perhaps he's the one who wrote the ema request the fox showed you.<br/>
<b>Lonely Boy:</b> Everyone talks about things I don't know about. Right now, they're all collecting stickers…<br/>
I have a sticker, too, but they all said, "Everyone has that one…"<br/>
If I had a rare sticker, I bet they'd become my friends…<br/>
&gt; The boy wants a rare sticker so he can make friends.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Only thing I have like a sticker is one of those prize redemption stickers from Tanaka's.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The boy noticed the Prize Sticker.<br/>
<b>Lonely Boy:</b> "Granter of your desires"?<br/>
If this sticker can do that, then I'm sure to make friends!<br/>
Mister, can you give me this sticker?<br/>
Yay! Thank you!<br/>
I'm sure to have lots of friends now!<br/>
&gt; The boy ran off cheerfully.<br/>
&gt; Will he make lots of friends…? You should ask him another time.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Not sure that's going to work but it's worth a shot. I ran into Chie later on.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You decided to train with Chie.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Whew. Let's call it a day.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Some asshole-looking guy showed up just as we were finishing.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00103.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> T-Takeshi…!?<br/>
W-Well… training! I'm working out!<br/>
<b>Takeshi:</b> Huh? When are you gonna graduate to being king of the hill?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> K-King of the hill…?<br/>
<b>Takeshi:</b> In kindergarten it was the Runt Gang, in elementary school you were an Ally of Justice…<br/>
Middle school, it was the Vanguards of the Lunch Revolution, wasn't it?<br/>
Haha, so… What is it now? You a Protector of Earth's Peace?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> W-Well…<br/>
<br/>
<i>You know, I'm not going to sit there while some douchey guy talks shit about a friend even if she does know the guy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00114.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Huh…? Wait, what're you saying?<br/>
&gt; Chie is in a panic.<br/>
<b>Takeshi:</b> Oh, uhhh… I didn't mean that in a mean way.<br/>
I'm Takeshi Kouno. I was with Chie up until middle school.<br/>
…I'm not gonna get in you guys' way.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Hey, what are you…?<br/>
<b>Takeshi:</b> Oh, how's Yukiko-san doing…? Does she have a boyfriend yet…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> …She's fine, and I don't think so.<br/>
<b>Takeshi:</b> I see. Cool, cool.<br/>
She still good-looking? Maybe I should try for her again…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> ……<br/>
<b>Takeshi:</b> I'll see you later. Say hi to Yukiko-san for me.<br/>
&gt; Chie looks somewhat sad to see Takeshi leave…<br/>
&gt; What should you do…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I already deeply despise that Takeshi dude and all he stands for but the mood really needed to be lightened after all that shit.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00129.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You pulled out your best joke…<br/>
&gt; You showed Chie your impression of a different Takeshi…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> ……<br/>
Hahaha! What, was that supposed to sound like him!?<br/>
&gt; Chie is laughing hysterically.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> I-I'm sorry. He really is rude, huh?<br/>
Seriously… He was always staring at Yukiko…<br/>
H-Hey, don't get me wrong. He's nothing but an old classmate to me!<br/>
We're just friends, y'know…? We used to get that a lot, though.<br/>
&gt; Chie smiles somewhat sadly…<br/>
&gt; You felt that you learned something about Chie…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Chie has grown deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm just saying Takeshi may be the killer and only by punching him a lot can we be sure. Not that I'm still sore about how much of an ass he was.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> …But that's all in the past!<br/>
Let's head home.<br/>
&gt; You talked with Chie about various things while walking home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Maybe this Takeshi guy is pissing me off so much because we've stalled so badly in the case. We need a new lead, badly. I hope Kanji gets better soon.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>6/6/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Kanji was back in school today, finally.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Haha, where'd the manners come from?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Well, um… I didn't know you guys were my senpai.<br/>
Uhh… Thanks a bunch.<br/>
Though I don't really remember what happened…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> There are some things we'd like you to tell us about.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> First off, who was that boy you met with?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> I-I really don't know much about him…<br/>
I mean, I've only met him twice…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Yeah, but you walked home from school with him. What did you guys talk about?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Uh, well… He just asked stuff like… If anything different happened lately…<br/>
But I dunno where my head was at… When I came to my senses, I blurted out that I wanted to see him again.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> To a guy.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> I, uh… I don't really get it myself.<br/>
Girls are so loud and obnoxious, so, y'know… I really don't like dealing with 'em.<br/>
Guys are a lot more laid-back.<br/>
S-So, uh, I started thinking… What if I'm the type who never gets interested in girls…?<br/>
And I couldn't accept that, so I kept spinning around and around in my head…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> Well, I can understand the part about feeling more relaxed around dudes.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I could sort of see where he was coming from too, but we had more important things to deal with.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00167.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> I'm fine now.<br/>
I mean, it was all in my head, when y'get down to it. I was the one shutting out that stuff.<br/>
So, uhh… Our family's run a textile shop for generations… Oh yeah, you already knew that.<br/>
My parents are kinda weird… They say stuff like, "Dyes are one with the universe," and "Cloth is alive…"<br/>
That's the kinda house I grew up in. So I've been interested in sewing and stuff since I was a kid.<br/>
But the second I say stuff like that, people look at me funny…<br/>
Girls make fun of me, the people in the neighborhood treat me like I'm some zoo animal, so I was sick of everything.<br/>
And when I got to my senses… I was running wild.<br/>
Shit, what's with me today? I'm going on and on about myself…<br/>
Forget all that. Man, I must look really lame right now.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Honestly I don't know if I could have put up with bullshit like that either.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00178.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Nah, I doubt it…<br/>
Haha… I've never talked about any of this stuff before.<br/>
Guess I never had anyone to tell it to.<br/>
I guess I wasn't really afraid of girls. I was just scared of people in general.<br/>
But all that's behind me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Wow, I'm surprised… You're a good kid…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> D-Don't call me a good kid…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> Hahaha, no need to get embarrassed. You're a big guy, you can take it.<br/>
Hey, is there anything you remember after you ran into us the second time?<br/>
You know, after you chased us away and said you were gonna take us down.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Huh? Uhh… I went home…<br/>
I was gonna sleep it off in my room… Wait, I think someone came…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> To your house!? Who was it!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Uh, well, it was just a feeling I had… I dunno if anyone actually came…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It seemed Kanji didn't really remember being grabbed either, sadly.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00193.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> When I woke up, I was laid out on the floor of that sauna place.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> A dark entrance…<br/>
Could it have been a TV?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Huh…? Now that you mention it, maybe so…<br/>
Uh, why do you ask?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> Oh, no reason… I was just wondering.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> Did the police ask you anything?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Well, my mom had called the cops to look for me, so they questioned me for a while.<br/>
I told them exactly what I just told you and they looked at me like I was crazy.<br/>
So, like… Are you guys playing detective or somethin'?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Mmm, well, something like that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Anything I can do to help?<br/>
If there's some bastard out there who put me through this, I ain't gonna rest until I make 'em pay.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> Seriously? Awesome! You'd make a great addition to our team!<br/>
Whaddaya say, Leader?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I can see no downside in the hardest son of a bitch in Inaba joining up with us. Even if he likes to sew.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00209.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Thank you, Sir! I'll put my life on the line for you guys!<br/>
I'll do my best!<br/>
&gt; Kanji Tatsumi joined your group!<br/>
&gt; He'll definitely be a strong asset in solving the case.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Things are looking up again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00214.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> Well, if we're gonna welcome aboard a new member…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> Should we take him to our special headquarters?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> We're still calling it that…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Wh-What's that!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> C'mon, let's go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Well, nobody would ever guess what we were talking about if they overheard us, that's for sure.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Huh? Shurr, I waf lifnin'.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> Close your mouth!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> So, uh… someone's killing people with a TV…? What, is he beating them to death?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> No, they weren't being beaten with a TV! Were you listening at all…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Don't worry, he'll understand once we sees the place with his own eyes.<br/>
But the way it happened was just the same as with Yukiko.<br/>
The killer kidnapped him first, then threw him into the TV.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> Yeah… It's scary.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It seemed our fears were true, by the way. Other people were watching the Midnight Channel.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00232.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Student's Friend:</b> Yeah. I keep wondering who'll show up next.<br/>
<b>TV-Loving Student:</b> I knew before it came on that he'd be the next one to appear.<br/>
What's that dude's name? That first-year who used to be in a biker gang…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Who the hell d'you think was next?<br/>
His name is Kanji Tatsumi…<br/>
And he wasn't in a biker gang-he's the one who beat the shit out of those leathered-up pansies.<br/>
So who are you dipshits…!?<br/>
Feh… Boring.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> I can't stand it…<br/>
Sure, they have no idea it's related to the murders, but still… How can they talk about their schoolmate like that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> They're like onlookers at a car crash. As long as it's not happening to them, they're dying to see…<br/>
Damn, this sucks… We don't even know who's gonna be targeted anymore.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke was sure right about that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00245.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> What was the other thing we thought they had in common?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> People involved in the initial case, about Ms. Yamano, are the targets… How about that?<br/>
<br/>
<i>This was always the flimsier part of our assumption.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00248.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Hmm. Think we're wrong about this one too?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> I dunno… That announcer was involved with their mothers, not them.<br/>
We haven't come up with a reason yet why the killer would target their children.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> You guys sayin' you don't have any clues?<br/>
Well listen up, 'cause I got somethin' big.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> What's that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> When I made my comeback at school today, there was an annoying brat hanging around.<br/>
Turns out he was snooping around about Senpai's and my disappearance, so I took this from him.<br/>
I dunno what the hell this all is, though.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Uh, and you took it anyway?<br/>
&gt; You took the paper from Kanji.<br/>
&gt; There are several lists…<br/>
&gt; Which one will you read out loud?<br/>
<br/>
<i>When I saw the lists, my jaw hit the floor. It was like a lightbulb went off. Whoever that person talking to Kanji was, he'd seen something we'd never even considered.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00262.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Mayumi Yamano 4/11, Saki Konishi 4/13…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> What're these dates? April 11th…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Oh, they found the first body on the day school started, so that would have been… the 12th.<br/>
The 11th is the day before that…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> I know I can't forget the day Saki-senpai's body was found… That was the 15th.<br/>
So then, what are these dates? And what does "List of TV programs" mean?<br/>
What's "Saki Konishi, April 13th"…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I would have entirely forgotten about this, I can't imagine how someone who doesn't know anything about the Midnight Channel or anything could have put it together.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00270.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> I see… Yeah, there's no doubt about it.<br/>
Oh yeah… I saw that, too. They were interviewing her because she found the first body.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> Then this part… "Mayumi Yamano, April 11th." Is that the day she appeared on TV, too…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Oh, she was on! I remember now! That was when the affair hit the news!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, wait a sec… Yukiko, didn't you get interviewed too?<br/>
When did that interview air!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> I-I think it was when I was absent from school… Um…<br/>
It was the day after I met you on the embankment. I had my kimono on… Do you remember?<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was a terrible rainy day made substantially brighter by that encounter, so I had no problem remembering it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-P4-00280.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> I went shopping that day, so… April 15th!<br/>
And right after that, I was kidnapped.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> Kanji! What about the television special you were on!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Oh yeah, that thing… Damn show made my mom go apeshit on me and…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> The date! Just tell us the date!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Uhhh, I don't remember the exact date… But it wasn't too long before I met you guys.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> It's true, then… Everyone was on TV before they disappeared.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> So, you think the killer's targeting people he sees on TV…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> I was so caught up with the news reports about the incidents that I didn't notice at all…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Seriously I really want to meet Kanji's friend again to thank them, that list might have broken the case.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-P4-00291.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> Now that I think about it… When the killer failed with Yukiko, they moved to Kanji instead of trying again…<br/>
Maybe this "being on TV" thing is some stupid rule that the killer's following.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> That's right… The killer could've targeted the same victim again…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> I think there's a definite connection here between the kidnapping and the TV broadcasts.<br/>
The victims weren't just involved with the first case. They were also shown on the mass media.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> That must be it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> But if so… What's the motive? Why kill someone just because they were on TV?<br/>
Argh… Dammit, now that I think about it, we haven't gotten anywhere!<br/>
Why can't I be smarter…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Dude, why beat yourself up? I think you guys are awesome.<br/>
I mean, you guys noticed what was happening to me and risked your lives to stop it.<br/>
That's more than enough.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> You rescued me, too.<br/>
We may not have solved the mystery, but we've saved two people already.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> That's true, but…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> What's more, everyone's deduction that Kanji-kun might be next was right on the nose.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> I know! We were so close.<br/>
<br/>
<i>To be fair to us Kanji did sort of leave us with few ways to keep him safe.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-P4-00309.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Well, if we know this much, I think we can outsmart the killer next time. Then it's a countdown to their arrest.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> Don't forget, it's always possible that Kanji-kun was the last target.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> Or so we hope… We've thwarted them twice already. Here's hoping the killer's learned their lesson by now.<br/>
Anyways, let's keep checking the Midnight Channel like usual when it rains.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> That reminds me… The school campout's next week. I hope it doesn't rain.<br/>
It's for both the first-year and second-year students, so we'll see you there, Kanji-kun.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Seriously? School, huh…? What a drag…<br/>
Yo, mind if I order another grilled steak?<br/>
I'm gonna finish this one up while the next one's on the grill. We're… going Dutch on the meal, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Well, let's get going. I think our new teammate needs to meet Mr. Bear.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Huh? What's up?<br/>
Fine, whatever… I'll go for something cheap, like ramen.<br/>
Wait, or should I get a takoyaki set…? Man, I can't decide.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> None of it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Whaaat!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>After all, we needed to get him some glasses.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Didn't think it was a bear, though.<br/>
Hey, why IS it a bear?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> Dunno.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Teddie.png"/> Me neither. I've been wondering too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> I-It's kinda cute…<br/>
M-Mind if I pet you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Teddie.png"/> No touching allowed, Mister.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Wha--!? Don't give me any lip, bear!<br/>
Tch…<br/>
Uhh… By the way, I been wondering. You were kidnapped too, right, Yukiko-senpai?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> Huh…? Yeah, it wasn't look before you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> So like, that means you came out to everyone too?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> Th-That's… Um…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> What was it like for Senpai-<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was already wincing before the slap even came.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-P4-00340.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> Oh, sorry… I didn't mean to hit you so hard…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> M-My jaw…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> I'll be more gentle next time…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> More… gentle…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> What a pair of dimwits…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Teddie.png"/> Oh yeah! Here's a present from me, Kanji! It's to celebrate you joining the team!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Ah, so these are the glasses you guys told me about.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> Hurry and put them on.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Huh? S-Sure… But hang on, aren't these different from everyone else's?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm not sure why Teddie even makes these things but they're hilarious.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-P4-00350.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> I-It looks perfect on you… Heehee…<br/>
Snrk… Ahahahaha!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> Haha, damn, dude. It looks great on you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Teddie.png"/> I had a normal pair ready for you. But Yuki-chan insisted on this one. She wouldn't budge!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Yeah, real funny, you smartass!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Teddie.png"/> Wh-Why are you taking it out on me!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Gimme that!<br/>
&gt; Kanji grabbed the other pair of glasses that Teddie was holding…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-KanjiGlasses.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> Heehee! Ahahahahaha…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Teddie.png"/> You took my spare pair… Kanji, you must really like those!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Ahaha! Oh, my sides!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Teddie.png"/> This is the real one. It wasn't easy getting it to you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kanji.png"/> Why the hell did you bother making a spare if it's more useless crap…!?<br/>
Dammit! I'll get you guys for this someday!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Yukiko.png"/> Ahahahaha!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Things are really looking up. If we keep our eyes on the news I'm sure we can figure out who'll be next, and be ready when the killer returns.</i>
