<br/>
<i>Everything was shrouded in fog, which might have been a good thing because the floor looked really unsettling for whatever reason.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; This is…?<br/>
&gt; The area is covered in a thick fog…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; All you can do right now is proceed forward…<br/>
<br/>
<i>As I moved forward, I heard a voice. It was just as indistinct as the world around me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You heard someone's voice…<br/>
<b>???:</b> If it's truth you desire, come and find me…<br/>
&gt; The voice came from up ahead…<br/>
<br/>
<i>There was some kind of door at the end of the path. I had a bad feeling about it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>The other room was filled with even thicker fog. I hadn't even realized I was carrying it before, but I found a sword in my hands. It felt pretty natural, even though I've not really used one before.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>There was someone else in there with me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>???:</b> Hmhmhm… Try all you like…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I could just barely make out where the voice was coming from.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>???:</b> I see… Indeed, you possess an interesting quality…<br/>
But… you will not catch me so easily…<br/>
If what you seek is "truth," then your search will be even harder…<br/>
<br/>
<i>The fog became even thicker…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>And I lost track of the voice.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>???:</b> Everyone sees what they want to….<br/>
And the fog only deepens…<br/>
…Will we meet again…?<br/>
At a place other than here…<br/>
Hmhm… I look forward to it…<br/>
&gt; You are losing consciousness…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
<br/>
<i>The fog was replaced by darkness.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You can hear someone's voice…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; It's almost time to get up…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You feel like you had a nightmare…<br/>
&gt; What could it have been about…?<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You're starting school today. You should head to the living room for now…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Anyway, I didn't have time to think about some crazy fog dream because it was time for school soon.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> Okay.<br/>
Let's eat.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I noticed Dojima wasn't around.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> There was some kind of trouble. He won't be back.<br/>
You're starting school today, right?<br/>
My school's on the way, so… let's go together.<br/>
&gt; Nanako seems somewhat restless…<br/>
&gt; You decided to head to school with Nanako.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was raining pretty heavily. The school zone is in the Samegawa river's flood plain.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> My school's this way. Bye.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was almost at school when some lunatic nearly killed himself on his bike.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Had to hurt.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; That looked painful…<br/>
&gt; You should leave him be…<br/>

<br/>
&gt; What kind of student life awaits you here…?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Student's Friend:</b> Yeah, it's King Moron alright… We get to enjoy his long-ass sermons every day for a whole year…<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> Hey you guys, I heard there's going to be a transfer student from the city in this class.<br/>
<b>Sitting Student:</b> Huh? Really? A guy or a girl?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> …Huh? You look dead today.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, um… I don't wanna talk about it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> What's with him?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Yukiko.png"/> Who knows?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I already don't like this teacher.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00084.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Morooka.png"/> I'm Kinshiro Morooka, your homeroom teacher from today forward!<br/>
First things first! Just 'cause it's spring doesn't mean you can swoon over each other like love-struck baboons.<br/>
Long as I'm around, you students are going to be pure as the driven snow!<br/>
Now I hate wasting my time, but I'd better introduce this transfer student.<br/>
This sad sack's been thrown from the big city out to the middle of nowhere like yesterday's garbage.<br/>
And he's just as much of a loser here as he was there, so you girls better not get any ideas about hitting on him!<br/>
Tell 'em your name, kid, and make it quick.<br/>
<br/>
<i>What the hell is this guy's problem?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00092.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Morooka.png"/> Hrnh… That's it, you're on my shit list, effective immediately.<br/>
Now listen up!<br/>
This town is miles away from your big city of perverts and assholes, in more ways than one.<br/>
You better not even think of getting involved with the girls here, let alone abusing them!<br/>
But what do I know… it's not like the old days. Even here, kids grow up so damn fast.<br/>
Every time I turn my back, you're fooling around on those damn phones, checking your life-journals and you're my-places…<br/>
&gt; Mr. Morooka goes on and on…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I got a nice save just about then.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00101.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Morooka.png"/> Huh? Yeah, sure. Hear that? Your seat's over there.<br/>
So hurry up and siddown already!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> He's the worst, huh?<br/>
Rotten luck for you to get stuck in this class… Well, we'll just have to hang in there for a year.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It seems this guy's a notorious asshole.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00106.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Male Student:</b> Sucks to be the transfer student, ending up in King Moron's class on the first morning here…<br/>
<b>Whiny Student:</b> Yeah, he won't think twice about suspending you if you get on his bad side.<br/>
Then again, we're all in the same boat…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Morooka.png"/> Shut your traps! I'm taking roll, and I damn well expect you to respond in an orderly manner!<br/>
&gt; Your life at this new school has begun.<br/>
&gt; Will you be able to fit in here…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>In an orderly and just world this would have been the worst thing that happened today.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00115.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>School Intercom:</b> Attention, all teachers.<br/>
Please report immediately to the Faculty Office for a brief staff meeting.<br/>
All students must return to their classrooms and are not to leave the school until further notice.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Morooka.png"/> Hrnh. You heard the announcement. Don't go anywhere until you hear otherwise.<br/>
<b>Brown-Haired Girl:</b> He's seriously getting on my nerves…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And the prick left, just in time for the sirens to start. Everyone started to freak out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00121.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Excited Student:</b> Ugh, I can't see a damn thing. Frickin' fog…<br/>
<b>Rumor-Loving Student:</b> Yeah, like every time it rains lately, it gets all foggy.<br/>
<b>Knowledgeable Student:</b> Hey, did you hear? I hear the paparazzi's looking all over for that announcer.<br/>
<b>Rumor-Loving Student:</b> Oh yeah. You mean Mayumi Yamano, right?<br/>
I heard some guys spotted her at the shopping district.<br/>
<b>Knowledgeable Student:</b> Actually, I heard that…<br/>
<b>Rumor-Loving Student:</b> Are you serious!?<br/>
H-Hey, Yukiko-san. Mind if I ask you something…?<br/>
Is it true that announcer's staying at your family's inn?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00131.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Rumor-Loving Student:</b> Y-Yeah, I guess not.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> *sigh * Sheesh, how much longer is this gonna take?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Yukiko.png"/> There's no telling.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> I shoulda left before the announcement came on…<br/>
By the way, didja try what I told you the other day?<br/>
You know… That thing about rainy nights…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Yukiko.png"/> Oh… No, not yet. Sorry.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> Ahhh, that's okay.<br/>
Well… it's just, I heard a guy in the class next door yell something like, "My soulmate is Yamano, the announcer!"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Then there was another announcement, seemed we could go now.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>School Intercom:</b> There has been an incident inside the school district. Police officers have been dispatched around the School Zone.<br/>
Please stay calm and contact your parents or guardians as soon as possible, and quickly leave the school grounds.<br/>
Do not disturb the police officers. Head directly home.<br/>
I repeat…<br/>
<b>Excited Student:</b> "Incident"!?<br/>
<b>Girl's Friend:</b> What, something actually happened?<br/>
<b>Brown-Haired Girl:</b> C'mon, let's go take a look!<br/>
<br/>
<i>The girl sitting next to me came up to me before I could leave.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00149.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> Why don't you come with us?<br/>
Oh, nearly forgot! I'm Chie Satonaka. You know I sit next to you, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Souji.png"/> Of course.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> Well, nice to meet you!<br/>
This is Yukiko Amagi.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Yukiko.png"/> Oh, nice to meet you… I'm sorry that this is so sudden…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> C'mon, don't apologize like that. It makes me look like I got no upbringing.<br/>
I just wanted to ask some stuff. Really, that's all.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Before we could leave, the guy who wiped out on his bike earlier came up to us. Seemed he had something to talk to Chie about.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-P4-00158.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> This was really awesome. Like, the way they moved was just amazing to see…<br/>
And… I'm really sorry! It was an accident! Please just have mercy until my next paycheck!<br/>
Seeya thanks!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> Stop right there! What did you do to my DVD!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> Argh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Note to self: Chie's kicks are brutally accurate.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-P4-00164.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> My "Trial of the Dragon"…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> I think mine's cracked too… C-Critical hit to the nads…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Yukiko.png"/> A-Are you all right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, Yukiko-san… Are you worried about me…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> He's fine, Yukiko. Let's ditch him and go home.<br/>
&gt; He looks like he's in a lot of pain…<br/>
&gt; You should leave him be…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I sure as hell wasn't going to get kicked myself. And things just kept getting stranger and stranger.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Yukiko.png"/> What…? Wh-Who are you?<br/>
<b>Onlooking Student:</b> What's up with him? What school's he from?<br/>
<b>Spectacled Student:</b> Never mind that, he's going for Yukiko-san? Man, you'd think he'd at least wait until she's alone to make his move…<br/>
<b>Onlooking Student:</b> I bet you a can of TaP he gets knocked out.<br/>
<b>Spectacled Student:</b> No bet. Haven't you heard how difficult the Amagi Challenge is?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Mitsuou.png"/>Um, s-so… are you coming or not?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Yukiko.png"/> I-I'm not going…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Mitsuou.png"/>…Fine!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Creepy fisheye bastard ran off.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-P4-00182.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> What did he want…? Obviously, he was asking you out on a date.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Yukiko.png"/> Huh? Really…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> You had no clue? Sheesh…<br/>
But then again, that was way over the top. It was creepy how he called you Yuki all of a sudden.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> Yo, Yukiko-san. Turned down another lovelorn fool, huh?<br/>
Man, you're cruel… You got me the same way last year.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Yukiko.png"/> I don't recall doing that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> Whoa, you serious? So then, you wanna hang out sometime!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Yukiko.png"/> …I'd rather not.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dude just cannot win.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-P4-00193.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> Anyways, you two better not pick on the transfer student too much.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> We're just curious, is all!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Yukiko.png"/> U-Um, I'm sorry for dragging you into this…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> C'mon, let's go. Everybody is staring.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I explained to them how I'd ended up here in Inaba.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-P4-00198.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> There really is nothing here, huh?<br/>
That is what makes it nice, but there's nothing much we can show to people from outside.<br/>
Oh! Though, there is something from Mt. Yasogami… I think our dyed clothes or pottery or something is kinda famous.<br/>
Oh wait, there's the Amagi Inn! Yukiko's family runs it. It's the pride of Inaba!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Yukiko.png"/> Huh? It's… just an old inn.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> Oh, no way, it's been in all sorta magazines as a hidden treasure.<br/>
It's a great inn! It's been going for generations, and Yukiko here is going to take over someday.<br/>
The inn actually attracts a lot of visitors to Inaba. It pretty much keeps this town going.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Yukiko.png"/> …I don't think that's entirely true.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> So, tell me. You think Yukiko's cute, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was sort of out of nowhere, and I panicked.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-P4-00209.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> I knew it!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Yukiko.png"/> Come on… Don't start this again…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> She's really popular at school, but she's never had a boyfriend. Kinda weird, huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Yukiko.png"/> C-Come on, stop it.<br/>
Y-You shouldn't believe that, okay? It's not true that I'm popular or that I've never had a boyfriend!<br/>
Wait, no! Wh-What I meant to say was, I don't need a boyfriend!<br/>
Geez… Chie!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> Hahaha! Sorry, sorry. But this is our chance to talk to somebody from the big city, and you barely said a word!<br/>
Hey, what's that?<br/>
<br/>
<i>The discussion was saved from going downhill by the worst possible circumstances.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-P4-00219.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Spectator Housewife:</b> Wow. Who could imagine THAT hanging from an antenna?<br/>
<b>Shopping Housewife:</b> I wanted to see it too.<br/>
<b>Spectating Housewife:</b> Uh, you got here too late… The police and fire department took it down just a moment ago.<br/>
<b>Shopping Housewife:</b> Well, I think it's terrifying. I can't believe a dead body showed up around here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> Wait… What did she just say? A dead body!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>And of course Dojima was there.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-P4-00225.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>One thing was sure, I did not want to be mistaken for one of these ghouls wanting to see a dead body.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-P4-00226.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Dojima.png"/> Huh… I should have figured that'd happen.<br/>
That damn principal. We told him not to let them through here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> …You know this guy?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Dojima.png"/> I'm Detective Dojima, his guardian. Uhh… Well, how should I say this… I hope you get along with him.<br/>
But you three really ought to stop wandering around and head straight home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It must have been a real mess, because this one cop came barreling out and threw up all over the place.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-P4-00232.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Dojima.png"/> Adachi! How long are you going to act like a rookie? You want to be sent back to the central office!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Adachi.png"/> I-I'm sorry… Nngh…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Dojima.png"/> *sigh * Go wash your face. We're gonna go around and gather information!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> Was this what that announcement was about…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Yukiko.png"/> What do they mean… it was hanging from the antenna…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> Hey, Yukiko…? Why don't we go to Junes some other time?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Yukiko.png"/> Good idea…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> Alright then, we're taking off. Starting tomorrow, neighbor, let's do our best!<br/>
&gt; The two of them left.<br/>
&gt; You decide to head straight home…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nanako was alone in the house when I got there. The news explained exactly why.</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>Announcer:</b> Our top story this evening concerns a bizarre case in a quiet suburb.<br/>
Around noon today, a woman was found dead near the Samegawa River in Inaba.<br/>
&gt; The School Zone is being shown on TV.<br/>
&gt; Could this be the incident you heard about…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was a real bombshell.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-P4-00248.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Announcer:</b> The initial results of the Inaba Police Department's investigation have revealed…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> Ah! The Inaba Police Department! Th-That's where Dad works!<br/>
……<br/>
<br/>
<i>She seemed really upset.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-P4-00252.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> …I know. That's his job, so this stuff happens.<br/>
<b>Announcer:</b> The body was found hanging from a large television antenna atop a local resident's roof.<br/>
Authorities are uncertain as to why the body was in such a state.<br/>
