<i>Nanako's still in the hospital, she can't have any visitors they said. I ran into Naoto at lunch, she wanted to see me about something after school.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Umm… Do you have any plans after school? I'd like you to come with me…<br/>
Thank you. I will see you later, then.<br/>
<br/>
<i>After all that drama yesterday, I needed something to take my mind off of what's going on. Oh, and Mr. Yamada is a disgusting pervert.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Yamada:</b> But ladies, it's no good to wear warm-ups under your skirts. …Why? Because no one can see your legs…<br/>
Er, that was a joke. Just my way of reminding you all to wear your school uniforms, got it?<br/>
Hmm, why don't I incorporate this cold weather into a geography question for you guys…?<br/>
I'll pick you, Souji-kun, since you don't even button the front of your uniform in cold weather!<br/>
The north or the south pole, which one is colder?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I read this in a book once.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Yamada:</b> …How'd you know? Did you see it on TV or something? Anyway, you're right, the south pole is colder.<br/>
The south pole is in Antarctica, which is a land mass. Hence, snow accumulates, resulting in elevation changes.<br/>
The difference between their lowest temperatures is about 30 degrees Celsius.<br/>
In addition, the snowy mountains create a windchill, which makes the sensible temperature drop even further.<br/>
Don't assume it gets warmer as you go south. The weather is dictated by a region's geographical features.<br/>
Now, please get out your textbooks. Let's go over the…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Anyway after class was out Naoto and I headed down to the riverbank again to look over those cards one more time.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> These cards came from Shiroku Store.<br/>
When I talked with the owner, her description matched the one you gave.<br/>
This "Phantom Thief" purchased these cards mere days before handing one to you…<br/>
If that's the case, it's hard to imagine that any elaborate process was performed on the card.<br/>
Although… I do detect the faint, lingering scent of citrus. A very weak cologne, perhaps…<br/>
*sigh * What should I do..?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided to lighten the mood a bit, which gave Naoto an idea.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Burn it… Reduce it to ashes? I don't suppose there's anything inside…<br/>
…Ah!<br/>
&gt; Naoto has realized something.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Impossible… but… could it be…?<br/>
…Your house is closer. Let's go test it out now!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed down to my house. When Naoto walked over to the burners, I started to get where she was going with this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; As the card was toasted with the fire from the stove, burnt letters appeared…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> It really was invisible ink…<br/>
The citrus juices staining the paper burn first, making it legible…<br/>
A grown man, employing such childish tricks!?<br/>
And this sentence here…<br/>
&gt; The card reads as follows…<br/>
<b>Writing on the Card:</b> Eating letters with a red face.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> "Eating letters with a red face"…? This is…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Now this one I knew, I'd seen it every time I went to Daidara.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Ahh, indeed it is. You're good with riddles, I see.<br/>
&gt; Naoto smiles. She seems to be having fun…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> A mailbox… There was one in the shopping district. Let's go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We rushed down to the shopping district to see what we could find.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It seems there was something hidden behind the mailbox…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> This is…<br/>
Grampa had this? Why did he keep it…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Souji.png"/> What was it?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> U-Umm…<br/>
&gt; Naoto has a strange look on her face…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> I made this… when I was a child.<br/>
It's a…<br/>
A… detective badge…<br/>
It has no real function, though…<br/>
A petty challenge… And the prize was this stolen detective badge…<br/>
…I have an idea who the Phantom Thief might be, but none as to his motive…<br/>
This is an important case to me.<br/>
And yet… without you, I'd never had cracked it.<br/>
Rather, I wouldn't have bothered…<br/>
…Thank you, Souji-san.<br/>
&gt; Naoto is showing her unconcealed smile, a rare occurrence…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Naoto has grown deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's really the least I can do, given how hard she threw herself into saving Nanako.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Normally, I'd think this isn't the time to play along with such games, but…<br/>
I, er… I think I'll let this play out… And, umm, if possible…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Souji.png"/> Let's do it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Huh…?<br/>
Oh, y-yes… Let's.<br/>
&gt; Naoto is blushing.<br/>
&gt; You walked Naoto to her house and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm still not used to walking into the house and not seeing Nanako or Dojima there. Dojima's tough, I'm sure he'll be okay. But Nanako… I just need to trust that she'll get better.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>11/8/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Naoto had received another card in her mail this morning, so we headed out to the riverbank again to take a look at it after school.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00083.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> This was in my mailbox this morning.<br/>
The Phantom Thief knows where I live…<br/>
…Which means he had other reasons for having you deliver the first card.<br/>
Why you, though…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I figured it might have been to make sure it got to her, though I'm not sure why that makes sense.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> I don't think that's the sort of metric the culprit would use…<br/>
&gt; Naoto is laughing heartily.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> So then, what do you think of the contents of this card?<br/>
&gt; The card reads as follows…<br/>
<b>Writing on the Card:</b> When the banks close, the fruit tree grows. By the large seven at the third is the spot I chose. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> More cryptic this time. Well, I anticipated that.<br/>
The first thing that comes to mind with "fruit tree" is the original card.<br/>
But the second sentence…<br/>
"By the seven," "at the third"… What do these numerical values mean…?<br/>
"When the banks close, the fruit tree grows. By the large seven at the third is the spot I chose…"<br/>
<br/>
<i>The numbers were what was really out of place to me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> The numbers themselves…?<br/>
…The seven and the third…<br/>
&gt; Naoto's eyes lit up.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> When the banks close, the fruit tree grows…" Look at the third and seventh words…<br/>
"Banks" and "tree." In other words, "by the large tree at the banks is the spot I chose!"<br/>
A-Anyway, let's search for the biggest tree at this river's banks!<br/>
&gt; You searched the river bank with Naoto…<br/>
&gt; There was something buried by the tree you found…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was a sort of strange looking watch.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00108.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Naoto holds a digital watch, slightly large for a child's wrist.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> This is pretty advanced, you know.<br/>
It's one of the seven tools of the detective. It has an extremely strong backlight.<br/>
You can use it to blind the enemy…<br/>
…I modified it when I was a child.<br/>
I've always loved this sort of thing, ever since childhood.<br/>
I preferred robots and cars to dolls and teddy bears…<br/>
I liked high places, so I had a secret base in the trees…<br/>
I enjoyed that…<br/>
Why…?<br/>
Why couldn't I have been born male…?<br/>
It would have been much easier for me… I could have done what I wanted to with gusto…<br/>
It's funny, isn't it…?<br/>
……<br/>
<br/>
<i>I, um, meant to tell her that she was just fine the way she was. It just sort of came out… awkward. I really don't know what came over me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00123.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Huh…?<br/>
Wh-What are you saying…? Hrmph…<br/>
There's nothing good about it!<br/>
&gt; Naoto is panicking fiercely…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Really… It's quite difficult to keep my composure when you're around.<br/>
I feel like I'm being lectured… Like I'm still a child…<br/>
……<br/>
&gt; Naoto looks at her feet, embarrassed…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Naoto has grown deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't know, it just felt like the right thing to say at the time.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00133.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> I-It seems I've been doing all the talking…<br/>
Why don't you tell me about yourself? What were you like as a child…?<br/>
…I wish I could have seen it.<br/>
&gt; You chatted idly with Naoto, then went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Another night home, another night alone. I need to come up with something I can do to occupy my time, I'm running out of books to read already.</i>
