<br/>
&gt; "The 'Miss' Yasogami High Pageant!"<br/>
&gt; …It seems that a cross-dressing pageant is also going to be held at the Culture Festival.<br/>
<b>Eager Student:</b> Hey, it's Yosuke! We're expecting great things from you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Haha, they're doing the cross-dressing pageant again this year? Man, they never learn, do they?<br/>
Ooh, some people have signed up already. Hahah, man, what idiots would want to be in this thing?<br/>
Let's see… Yosuke Hanamura…<br/>
Meeeeeee!?<br/>
Wait, and… Kanji Tatsumi!?<br/>
You're on here too!<br/>
&gt; "Souji Seta"… That's your name, all right!<br/>
<b>Impressed Student:</b> Wow, there's a lot of contestants. Didn't we only get, like, two people last year?<br/>
<b>Disinterested Student:</b> I heard this year, even if someone else signs you up, you can't back out.<br/>
<b>Impressed Student:</b> Well, that's not cool… Hey, but what if they did sign themselves up?<br/>
<b>Disinterested Student:</b> Ewwww, what a disturbing thought. Seriously, that's really wrong.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Someone else signs you up…?<br/>
It's them… They must've done this…<br/>
&gt; It seems that you'll have to enter the cross-dressing pageant at the Culture Festival…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Needless to say this demanded a response.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> For what?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> For what, my ass! For singing us all up in the cross-dressing pageant! It was you, wasn't it!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Ohhh, yeah, that thing.<br/>
Rise-chan started saying, "Let's all have fun with this!" so I didn't really have a choice.<br/>
And Kashiwagi seems happy, too, now that there's more people involved in it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> You little…! This is cross-dressing! CROSS! DRESSING!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Well, you're the one who started it!<br/>
It's because of you that we can't back out of the beauty pageant, so it serves you right!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> That's beside the point…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> Don't worry.<br/>
We'll make you absolutely enchanting. Okay?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> That's not what's important here!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> It's about a man's pride, dammit!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yeah I mean Yosuke really screwed them over but this was kind of excessive.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I know, right!? You heard him! This is absolutely out of the question!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Yeah, yeah. This has nothing to do with pride or any of that.<br/>
You know already, right? Once someone signs you up, you can't back out.<br/>
If you've got a problem with that, go talk to Ms. Kashiwagi.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Th-There's no way she's gonna listen!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Wha--!? Why're you giving up!?<br/>
I ain't doin' this! Period!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> Kanji-kun, are you still okay as far as the mandatory attendance policy?<br/>
I don't think it would be wise to disappoint a teacher too much.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> You are a scary gal, you know that, Senpai…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Just leave it to us to dress you guys up.<br/>
Rise-chan's with us too.<br/>
There's no way you won't turn out pretty.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Y-You're positive we'll be pretty…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> I guarantee it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, why're you suddenly fine with this!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't know what's worse, that I'm having to envision us in dresses or that I'm going to have to KNOW what it will look like.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> There's nothing manly about being a woman!<br/>
I seriously refuse…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Kashiwagi's sure gonna get angry if you don't show up… Maybe you and Kanji-kun can be classmates next year.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Wh-Why is this happening…?<br/>
&gt; It seems that you can't refuse…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> We all end up in the same boat, without our consent…<br/>
What kinda joke is this…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> The exact same joke you pulled on us!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> "I-If we gotta do this, might as well go all the way with it!" Ahahahaha!<br/>
<br/>
<i>At least it's on the second day of the festival, so there's still one day left before we're all abjectly humiliated.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>10/29/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Is there anything Yosuke's good at? I'm going to posit that the answer to this question is no.</i><br/>

&gt; …No one is stopping by.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> C-Come in for a first-hand experience with group dating…<br/>
……<br/>
Ooh… This is so embarrassing…<br/>
There's not that many people passing by here in the first place…<br/>
<b>Male Class Rep:</b> I think we need some shills to drum up interest.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Shills…? Uh, who?<br/>
<b>Male Class Rep:</b> Who else is here besides us?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I-Isn't that kinda sad?<br/>
<b>Male Class Rep:</b> Do we have a choice? We need customers to get the ball rolling.<br/>
If there aren't many people passing by, we have to get the attention of the ones who are by any means necessary.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> But there's only five of us here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Yo, how's it going?<br/>
I came to check up on you… guys?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Perfect timing!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> But now we've got four guys and two girls.<br/>
<b>Male Class Rep:</b> Eh, you guys are cross-dressing tomorrow anyways. One of you can sit on the girls' side.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> What!? I'm not gonna-<br/>
<br/>
<i>You know what they say about snoozing and losing. And Yosuke deserving ANYTHING bad that happens to him.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00084.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Male Class Rep:</b> There you go, Yosuke. You'll be our girl.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> A-Are you serious…?<br/>
<b>Male Class Rep:</b> Well, let's get started.<br/>
……<br/>
Uhh… You guys can start now.<br/>
…………Will someone please start?<br/>
……<br/>
&gt; The silence is heavy…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Actually, what the hell is this?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> A mock group date…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke needs to NOT DO THIS by the way. It's really creepy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00095.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> You don't have to talk like a girl…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> S-So, what are your hobbies…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Man, you're enjoying this, aren't you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> I like, uh, martial arts in general. M-Mainly watching them… Ahahah…<br/>
Yikes, this is really embarrassing…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> M-My hobby is, um… defeating Shadows?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> That's not a hobby!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> O-Oh yeah, sorry…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Okay, then we'll ask you a question next!<br/>
Umm, umm…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> What type of girls do you like?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Whoa, getting right to the point…<br/>
<b>Male Class Rep:</b> I guess… cute girls?<br/>
Man, this is lame…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, now it dawns on you…?<br/>
Your turn. What type of girls do you like?<br/>
<br/>
<i>God this is so awkward.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00112.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Ooh, me too! You get this urge to care for and protect them…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Don't think they asked you, Yosuke-senpai.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Your turn, Kanji-kun.<br/>
Uh, well, I…<br/>
I-I guess someone who's kind of mysterious, and looks strong but's actually kinda…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> …Yeah, I really wonder who you're talking about.<br/>
&gt; Should you try asking a question…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke hadn't suffered enough at this point in my estimation.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00120.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Well, you guys are all wonderful… But I think you'd be the most reliable, Souji…<br/>
I-I mean-You idiot! Don't make me play along!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> *sigh *<br/>
&gt; The silence is heavy…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Rise walked in the door just then.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> ……<br/>
…Uhhh, ahaha…<br/>
W-Well, seeya!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Mark it. The group date café is officially a failure…<br/>
&gt; The first day of the Culture Festival ended on a strange note…<br/>
&gt; You decide to at least walk around the school a bit before going home.<br/>
&gt; Yasogami High hallway…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I checked out some exhibits with Daisuke and Kou, their class had a much better thing they were doing.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00133.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Kou.png"/> We're doing a freakin' play, man! What's up with that!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Daisuke.png"/> It's too late to complain, Piglet.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Kou.png"/> It's not Piglet! It's Hamlet! How'd I get stuck with that role, anyway…!?<br/>
And who the hell came up with this play!? "Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet" …Dude, THEY ALL DIE!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Daisuke.png"/> …Chilll out, dude. Tomorrow's gonna be way more exciting, right Souji?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Kou.png"/> For sure! I'm gonna be rooting for you in that beauty contest!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Daisuke.png"/> Remember, first place or bust!<br/>
&gt; You had fun with Kou and Daisuke…<br/>
<br/>
<i>A bit later I was walking around with Ai, and we found an exhibit that was a bit out of place.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Ai.png"/> Oh come on. Who'd believe crap like this?<br/>
<b>Familiar Voice:</b> *chuckle *<br/>
You're a confident one…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Ai.png"/> Hm, maybe you are pretty good…<br/>
You wanna challenge me? I bet you can't win!<br/>
<b>Familiar Voice:</b> Overestimating your competence will only work against you, miss…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Ai.png"/> Hmph, I'll take that as your acceptance!<br/>
I challenge you to read one fortune, no time limit! If I win, which I will, I'm going to destroy this stand!<br/>
The subject of this little contest is… Souji's relationships with girls!<br/>
<b>Familiar Voice:</b> *chuckle * If that's the case, I most certainly have the advantage.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Ai.png"/> …What does that mean?<br/>
&gt; You share a stirring moment with Ai…<br/>
<br/>
<i>No comment on how that turned out. Tomorrow's the day. Ugh.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> C'mon, Kanji-kun. Over here!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> Don't worry, I won't hurt you.<br/>
&gt; The cross-dressing pageant will begin soon…<br/>
&gt; It looks like you'll have to give up and let Yukiko apply makeup on you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> What about me?<br/>
It turns out I'm entering this too. I must win this contest to see my dream realized!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> He seemed bored, so we signed him up as a last-minute contestant.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> So you're making him suffer too, huh…?<br/>
Well, if he's been signed up, there's nothing we can do about it.<br/>
Naoto-kun, can you lend us a hand? We'll leave Teddie to you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Naoto.png"/> M-Me?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> The Naoto-Teddie team's unstoppable!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Naoto.png"/> Well then, um…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> First, I need some dazzling makeup!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Naoto.png"/> Y-You're right. Then I'll go borrow a makeup kit from someone…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> Wait! The battle begins by choosing the right equipment!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Ooh, we gotta use fake eyelashes, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Y-Yeah, bring it on!<br/>

<br/>
<b>MC:</b> Ladies and gentlemen!<br/>
We now begin the second day of the Culture Festival with the ever-popular "Miss" Yasogami Pageant!<br/>
Let's get right down to it and introduce our first contestant!<br/>
She's a runaway express train who's Inaba born and bred, and can kill with both her fists and her looks!<br/>
Presenting Kanji-chan of the first-year Class 3!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yeah, Rise sort of failed at the admittedly impossible task of making Kanji 'pretty.'</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00184.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Girl's Voice:</b> Gyaaaaaah!<br/>
Ewww! That's so creepy!<br/>
<b>Boy's Voice:</b> This is wrong on every level…<br/>
<b>MC:</b> Now, don't rip me apart for asking, but… What would you say is your best feature?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> …My eyes?<br/>
<b>MC:</b> Whoa! A conventional answer from this all-too-unconventional beauty!<br/>
After such a strong start, I don't know how much of a chance the others have, but here's our second contestant!<br/>
An eloquent heiress of the noble Junes, she's pure disappointment from the moment she opens her mouth!<br/>
Presenting Yosuke-chan of the second-year Class 2!<br/>
<br/>
<i>The creepiest thing is that Yosuke was actually trying.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00194.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Girl's Voice:</b> Holy crap!<br/>
And here I thought Yosuke-senpai would be able to pull it off!<br/>
<b>Boy's Voice:</b> Dude, it's terrifying… I can just imagine someone like him sitting across from me on a train!<br/>
<b>MC:</b> Now, you look ready to win in that outfit… Do you often dress like this?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hell no!<br/>
Uh… *cough * Like, no way!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> What is with this? We're laughingstocks up here!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> What did you think this was about…?<br/>
<b>MC:</b> I've already had about enough of this, but there's still more to come! Up next, our third contestant!<br/>
She has the mildly bitter tang of the city, and she's made more girls cry than there are stars in the sky!<br/>
Presenting our transfer student who's been breaking hearts in the second-year Class 2, Souji-chan!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think I ended up with the most dignity remaining out of this. Which is still not much.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00207.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Girl's Voice:</b> Senpai!? Why are you doing this!?<br/>
<b>Boy's Voice:</b> Whoa… I thought he was cooler than that…<br/>
<b>MC:</b> Sounds like your entrance is causing quite a stir! Did you sign yourself up?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Souji.png"/> My friends forced me…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Tell him Chie Satonaka did it!<br/>
Damn that Kashiwagi…<br/>
How dare she tear way our innocence like this! Now I'm scarred for life, dammit!<br/>
<b>MC:</b> Our last contestant is a random, unaffiliated entrant! She's a friend of our other "beauties"!<br/>
Calling herself "King of the TV World," she's a cute, sexy little number!<br/>
Give a warm welcome to Teddie-chan!<br/>
<br/>
<i>It seems all that experience disguising herself as a guy has made Naoto very good at this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00219.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Girl's Voice:</b> Huh!? That's a boy!?<br/>
He's so cute!<br/>
<b>Boy's Voice:</b> I'd hit it…<br/>
&gt; The votes have been collected…<br/>
<b>MC:</b> And the winner of this year's "Miss" Yasogami Pageant is…<br/>
The random contestant who won everyone's hearts, Ms. Teddie!<br/>
As our champion, Ms. Teddie will receive a very special prize…<br/>
Later this afternoon, we will be hosting the Miss Yasogami Pageant, with actual beauties this time!<br/>
Your reward is a position as an honorary judge in that pageant!<br/>
<br/>
<i>So that's what Teddie was after. He did this weird dance that will haunt my nightmares to celebrate.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00229.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> A-An honorary judge…? That's one lame prize for what you gotta go through…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Not everyone can get that excited over a judge position.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> Seeing him so happy kind of makes me happy too…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Yeah, he's like over the top innocent.<br/>
<b>MC:</b> Well then, Ms. Teddie, how does it feel to have won the pageant and become a judge?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> Hmhmhm… The long-awaited day has finally come!<br/>
I decree that one of the judging criteria later this afternoon will be…<br/>
Tadaaaaa! A swimsuit competition!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Wh-Wh-What the hell!? Over my dead body!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Aww, I didn't bring a swimsuit!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> That bear needs to be disappeared…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Naoto.png"/> Well, I doubt he has the authority to declare that unilaterally…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Kashiwagi.png"/> *chuckle * This is great! I love the direction this is going!<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> What is she, the rival woman on a soap opera…? Wait, is Kashiwagi serious about winning this?<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> Mr. Teddie dropped this off.<br/>
He said that they're swimsuits…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Hey! We don't need them!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Kashiwagi.png"/> *chuckle * Heeheeahahahahaaaaahahaha! My mature charms will win the day!<br/>
I brought my own swimsuit, of course.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Hanako.png"/> I brought my own too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Wh-What's with these people…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> Hey, l-let's not do this…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Kashiwagi.png"/> What's that? Getting cold feet? Wise of you to back out of a fight you can't win.<br/>
You call yourself an idol… But you're just jailbait with no brains, no guts, and especially no figure.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> What…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Hanako.png"/> There's no way their type would be crowned Miss Inaba. Why not just let them back out?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Oh, and I suppose you think you're gonna take the crown!? You little… snoring pig!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Hanako.png"/> Snoring? What're you talking about? Your face is as foul as your mouth, and your brain's rotten to boot.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> We went through hell because of you…<br/>
Th-That's it! Now I'm pissed!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00262.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Hanako.png"/> Let this be a warning to the others, too.<br/>
You're going to lose. Now's your last chance to run away.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> R-Run away? Why the hell would we run from someone like you!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> Well… We did kinda run away last time…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> That's what I'm saying! We gotta stand our ground and get our revenge for that!<br/>
How can we cower and hide when they're picking a fight!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> Y-Yeah…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Right, Rise-chan? Naoto-kun!? We wont' run from this, right!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Naoto.png"/> Huh…!? Me too!?<br/>
Why are you letting yourself be so easily provoked!?<br/>
Th-Th-Th-There's no way!<br/>
Absolutely. No. Way. That I'm wearing a swimsuit!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> You're not goin' anywhere…!<br/>
<br/>
<i>At least it wasn't us this time. The pageant started out with Kashiwagi and Hanako, who are both terrible people. It then proceeded with an introductory round.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>MC:</b> The judging continues! Can you hear the crowd going wild!?<br/>
Now, for our next contestant, Ms. Chie Satonaka of the second-year's Class 2! Come on out, Chie!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> H-Hi, I'm Chie Satonaka.<br/>
<b>MC:</b> Tell us a little bit about yourself!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> U-Um, I'm kind of shy and reserved… And my favorite food is… pudding.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> That liar… It's steak.<br/>
<b>MC:</b> Thank you very much!<br/>
Up next, another contestant from Class 2, Ms. Yukiko Amagi!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> H-Hello, my name is Yukiko Amagi.<br/>
Um, my family runs the Amagi Inn.<br/>
If you ever find yourself in the area, please give us a visit.<br/>
Our hot springs are open to the public year-round, so whenever you're in the mood to enjoy them, please drop by…<br/>
<b>MC:</b> Alright, that'll do nicely!<br/>
Next up, a very familiar face-from the first-year Class 2, Ms. Rise Kujikawa!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Hi-hi! My name's Rise Kujikawa!<br/>
I haven't been in town very long, but it's a great place and I'm 100% thrilled to be here!<br/>
So sorry that I'm not working as an idol right now! Risette's gonna do her best, so I hope you'll all cheer for me!<br/>
<b>MC:</b> The real Risette ladies and gentlemen, in the flesh! Thank you very much!<br/>
Next is the mysterious transfer student of the first-year's Class 1, Ms. Naoto Shirogane!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, Kanji… Here she comes…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Hey, shhh! Pipe down!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Naoto was clearly pretty uncomfortable to be up there, which she didn't really need to be.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-P4-00299.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Naoto.png"/> It's hard to believe I'm up on stage at a pageant like this…<br/>
This is beyond my wildest imaginings… I-I really don't know what to say…<br/>
…C-Can I step back now…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Wh-Whoa…<br/>
<b>MC:</b> And with that, all six uniquely beautiful contestants are on stage!<br/>
Now, let's have our special judge, Mr. Teddie, ask them some questions.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> Ehem. I am Teddie, the honorary judge for this pageant.<br/>
Please keep in mind that if you anger me, you will be at a disadvantage…<br/>
Well, Ms. Chie. Do you have a boyfriend?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Wha--!? T-Teddie, you…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> Ms. Yukiko, have you ever smooched anyone before?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> Huh…!? S-Stop it!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> Ms. Naoto, where are you ticklish?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Naoto.png"/> I-I beg your pardon?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> Can I say at your house next time, Rise-chan?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> What kind of a question if that…?<br/>
<b>MC:</b> A-Anyways, I have a surprise announcement for you all!<br/>
<br/>
<i>It seemed that Kashiwagi had taken Teddie's suggestion.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-P4-00317.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>MC:</b> And it's all thanks to Mr. Teddie here!<br/>
We'll take a brief break while our contestants put on their swimsuits and be back in just a few moments!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Teddie must have taken advantage of all those notes with the girls' measurments.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-P4-00320.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Oooooooh.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> You sound like a dirty old man…<br/>
Chie-senpai is cute, though…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> I-I'm sorry…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Sorry for what? This is great!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Wow, Yukiko-senpai… She's exactly how I imagined she'd be…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Yoohoo, heeere's Risette!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Whoa, this isn't fair! An idol has that glow to her that other girls don't have!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Really?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nobody should have been surprised by what failed to happen next.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-P4-00330.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>MC:</b> Ms. Naoto?<br/>
She's not coming out…<br/>
Well, sad news, everyone, but Ms. Naoto won't be coming out for this portion.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Kashiwagi.png"/> Fine by me! The fewer rivals I have to crush, the better.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Oh well, I had a feeling that would happen…<br/>
Too bad, Kanji.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Huh? No, um… well, yeah…<br/>
But don't you think it was brave of her to at least show up in the first round?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, you're right.<br/>
Well, it's about time we voted… Who're you going for?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'd feel bad if nobody voted for Naoto, she did try really hard even though it was making her incredibly uncomfortable.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-P4-00341.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Huh? Is that allowed?<br/>
<b>MC:</b> Thanks for waiting, everyone. The results are in!<br/>
Looking at the way the vote went…<br/>
You guys out in the audience had a hard time picking a favorite!<br/>
Lots of different opinions, with every one of our contestants having their own enthusiastic supporters!<br/>
On the other hand, it looks like you girls were all thinking the same thing! And so there's a clear winner…<br/>
Grand prize goes to…!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I didn't really see this coming.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-P4-00349.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>MC:</b> Her androgynous charm seems to have won most of the girls' hearts.<br/>
We'd like to present Ms. Naoto with her award now, but…<br/>
It looks like she stepped outside.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> She won even though she dropped out of the last part…<br/>
Ahaha, that's pretty funny.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Man, losing to Naoto… Well, I guess I didn't appeal to the girls that much. Oh well!<br/>
I think it's enough that we beat those hands down, Senpai!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Kashiwagi.png"/> Grr… I… How could I lose a beauty pageant…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Hanako.png"/> Ms. Kashiwagi… I… I can't believe this…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Kashiwagi.png"/> Neither can I! Oh, Hanako!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Hanako.png"/> M-Ms. Kashiwagiii!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We all got together after the pageant, we even managed to track Naoto down.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Dojima.png"/> Ah, good thing we found you.<br/>
I've got to make a business trip to the prefectural office, and I won't be back until tomorrow.<br/>
Shame it had to fall during your school's Culture Festival. Nanako and I were both looking forward to it…<br/>
Sorry to dump this on you, but could you show Nanako around?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> Would you like to walk around with us, Nanako-chan?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Nanako.png"/> Can I?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Dojima.png"/> Thanks. Then I'm gonna get going.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Nanako.png"/> Have a safe trip.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Dojima.png"/> Yeah. You have fun too, Nanako.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Nanako.png"/> Okay, dad!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> Hey Nanako-chan, why don't you come over and stay at my place tonight?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> Huh? Huh? Huh? What did you just say, Yuki-chan!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Oooh, a celebration at your inn!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Is that okay with you!?<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hell yeah! I'm down!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> Can I boil in the hot springs!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Naoto.png"/> Oh, I should call my Grampa and let him know! It's just one night, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> C'mon, it'll be fun. Everyone will be there.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Nanako.png"/> Can I…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Souji.png"/> It's up to you, Nanako.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Nanako.png"/> Let's go! I wanna spend the night!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> Wheeee! Hot springs! Yukata! Flushed skins!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Are you sure its' okay…? I mean, isn't it still the busy season?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> We've had fewer visitors this year… There are some open rooms, too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Oh, okay… Might as well, then!<br/>
Man, when was the last time I stayed at Yukiko's place?<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> Aww… We're in different rooms…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Well… Duh.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> It's one thing if they were next door, but they're so far away…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yukiko said there weren't that many open rooms, so they're up on another floor.<br/>
First thing they're gonna do is take Nanako-chan to the hot springs.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> I-Is it one of those "girls and guys together" springs!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> I don't wanna take more'n one bath if I don't have to. Why don't we take a dip before we hit the sack?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> By the way... 'sup with this room?<br/>
It looks pretty expensive…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, you thought so too? Normally a room like this wouldn't be open during the busy season…<br/>
I was trying not to think about it, but… You don't think something happened here, do you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Senpai…? What're you all… quite about?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Now that you mention it-<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Hello?<br/>
Oh, I see! Cool, thanks!<br/>
That was the front desk.<br/>
Said the hot springs should be pretty empty right now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Wow, Amagi Inn, great service… I broke out in a cold sweat…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Well, c'mon then, let's go wash it off.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> I can't wait to take a bath with everyone.<br/>
We'll all face the same way and wash each other's backs, and we're gonna sing songs while looking at Mr. Fuji, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Souji.png"/> That's a bath house.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> Man, everything on this side is so fun.<br/>
It's all thanks to you for bringing people over to my side.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> Wow, it really is smooth.<br/>

I got the times mixed up… Ahahahaha!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Are you serious…?<br/>
Crap, I think we went too far with them…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Naoto.png"/> Er… What should we do?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Oh, it'll be fine as long as we keep quiet about it! This'll just be between us girls!<br/>

I was trying to block it out, and you had to go and say it!<br/>
S-So that's why there's talismans here… Yukiko… That witch tempted us here knowing full well…!<br/>
Dammit! First the hot spring, now this! We've been completely suckered!<br/>
Ohhhh crap…<br/>
There's no way I'm sleeping through this!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> I've made up my mind! I'm going to Yuki-chan's room!<br/>
I can't sleep soundly unless I'm watching everyone's sleeping faces as I drift off.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Wha-sleeping faces!? Are you gonna sneak into their room!? You can't be…<br/>
Hey, what should we do…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Clearly we needed to NOT DO what Teddie was suggesting because god damn has nothing good come from Teddie or Yosuke in the last few days.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-P4-00507.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Then we'll have to spend the night here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> N-No way… I can't! I won't!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Teddie2.png"/> Alrighty! It'll be a surprise awakening for them!<br/>
&gt; It turns out you're going to be sneaking into the girls' room…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't even know where that crazy son of a bitch keeps that bear suit but damned if he didn't change into it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-P4-00512.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Teddie.png"/> It's a surprise awakening… no, a surprise break-in… This is Teddie, reporting in!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> When did you put that on…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Teddie.png"/> I feel awkward without it… so I alwaaaays bring it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Stop talking like that!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Oh, check it out, a hairbrush. And it's got long strands of hair on it…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> You're really into this, aren't you…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Damn straight. It's time I got revenge for the campout…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, good point! Alright, I'll get my revenge too…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Teddie.png"/> A-A toothbrush!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Holy crap… My heart's pounding…<br/>
But what about Nanako-chan…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Teddie.png"/> Don't worry! Nanako-chan is a magnanimous girl!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> W-Well, that's true…<br/>
But try not to wake her up. He's not part of our revenge scheme.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I began to perceive an even deeper issue with what was going on here, so I let Teddie and Kanji take the lead on this one.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-P4-00527.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Teddie.png"/> 'Scuse me…<br/>
Yuki-chan, I'm scared of the ghosts!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> A-Alright… I can do this too… T-Time to prove I'm a man!<br/>
Ch-Chie-senpai, be gentle!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Huh? One, two… Wh-Where's the rest of the futons…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I now fear neither death nor hell, because I've seen what men were not meant to see.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-P4-00533.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Hanako.png"/> Sheesh…<br/>
Oh my! So that's how you guys are?<br/>
Awww! You should've said so!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Kashiwagi.png"/> Hmmmm… Such naughty boys!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Teddie.png"/> A-A-Aaaaaaaaagh! Begoooooone!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Holy crap! D-D-Don't touch me!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Kashiwagi.png"/> We were crying our poor eyes out until now, you know? We thought there were no men who appreciated our beauty…<br/>
Alright, boys… I'm all yours. And not a word about this to anyone!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Hanako.png"/> C'mere, tiger!<br/>
&gt; You've seen things no student should see…<br/>
&gt; …You decide to give up and go back to your room to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Hell with all this, I'm living life to its fullest from this moment on.</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>Elsewhere…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-P4-00545.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> I love love LOVE being able to take a bath any time I want!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> How's Nanako-chan?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Fast asleep.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Hey, did you know Ms. Kashiwagi and Hanako-san were staying in the room next to ours?<br/>
Those two seem to get along really well… I'm surprised.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> They come and stay here now and again.<br/>
Usually they come to cry when something breaks their hearts…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Huh. I guess they were really devastated from losing to Naoto-kun.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Naoto.png"/> P-Please don't bring that up again…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Well, they do make a good team.<br/>
&gt; The night at the Amagi Inn passes by…<br/>
