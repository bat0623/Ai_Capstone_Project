<i>I knew something must be up right from the moment I got up, Dojima was rushing out.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Dojima left the house…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Nanako.png"/> …Dad has to go do something. He got a call, so he left.<br/>
&gt; Nanako looks worried…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Gossip was already starting even before people knew what was up.</i><br/>

<b>Red Umbrella Girl:</b> When I looked, I saw three police cars zooming by.<br/>
<b>White Umbrella Girl:</b> You live by the police station, don't you? Did you hear anything?<br/>
<b>Red Umbrella Girl:</b> I heard yelling, but nothing more. Total disappointment.<br/>
<b>White Umbrella Girl:</b> Geez, you need to pay more attention to stuff like that. How else are we supposed to get the juicy stories?<br/>
&gt; You hear sirens nearby…<br/>
&gt; It seems there's been an incident…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; …You decide to head to school.<br/>
<br/>
<i>They called us all in for an assembly.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Long-Haired Girl:</b> Of course not… What, is that rumor for real?<br/>
<b>Rumor-Loving Girl:</b> I dunno, but it seems like a lot of people have seen it.<br/>
&gt; You overhear people gossiping about something.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Yukiko said she'd be here after lunch…<br/>
I wonder why they're holding a school assembly all of a sudden.<br/>
…Hey, what's wrong, Yosuke?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, it's nothing…<br/>
<b>Ms. Sofue:</b> Everyone, please settle down. The school assembly is about to begin.<br/>
First, the Principal has something to say.<br/>
<b>Principal:</b> I… regret to say that I have a terrible announcement for all of you.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was worse than we ever could have imagined.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Principal:</b> …has passed away.<br/>
 <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Passed away…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> ……<br/>
<b>Principal:</b> Ms. Konishi was found deceased early this morning…<br/>
The reasons behind her passing are currently under investigation by the police.<br/>
If they ask you for your cooperation, I urge you as students of this school to provide only the facts.<br/>
All right, please quiet down…<br/>
I have been assured by the faculty that there's been no evidence that bullying was involved in the incident.<br/>
So mind what you say, not only to the police but to anyone who asks…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Found dead…? How could this happen…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> ……<br/>
&gt; The Principal's address continues…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Old bastard's only concerned with covering his own ass. And nobody could stop talking about the damn details of her death.</i><br/>

<b>Girl's Friend:</b> Well, last time, it was from an antenna, but this time she was hanging from a telephone pole.<br/>
It's gotta be a serial murder case…<br/>
<b>Rumor-Loving Girl:</b> Someone said the cause of death was some unknown poison.<br/>
<b>Girl's Friend:</b> Unknown…? C'mon, this isn't some sci-fi drama.<br/>
Oh, by the way, did you hear? Someone saw a girl that looked like Saki on that Midnight Channel thingie.<br/>
They said she totally looked like she was in pain. Isn't that scary?<br/>
<b>Rumor-Loving Girl:</b> Haha, sounds like someone had a nightmare.<br/>
The media's been broadcasting their interviews with her nonstop, so maybe they just had Saki on the brain.<br/>
<br/>
<i>People can be so ghoulish.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Hey… Did you guys check out the TV last night?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Yosuke! Not you too!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Just listen for a sec! Something kept bothering me, so… I watched it again, and…<br/>
I think the girl on the screen… was Saki-senpai.<br/>
There's no mistaking it…<br/>
Senpai looked like… she was writing in pain…<br/>
And then… she disappeared from the screen.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> What…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> You heard Senpai's body was found in a similar situation as that announcer's, right…?<br/>
Well, remember that guy you told us about? How he was all excited that his soulmate was the announcer?<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was about that point I figured out where Yosuke was going with this, and a chill ran down my spine.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Ms. Yamano might've been on that Midnight Channel before she died, too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> What's that supposed to mean…?<br/>
Hold on… Are you saying…<br/>
People who appear on that TV… die…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> I can't say for sure.<br/>
But something tells me… I just can't dismiss it as coincidence.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Plus, remember what that bear thing said? How that place was dangerous, and we should leave before the fog clears…?<br/>
It also said that someone's been throwing people in there.<br/>
And that room with the posters on the wall… It has to have something to do with the announcer's death.<br/>
I mean… don't you think there's some kind of connection there?<br/>
Couldn't that world in the TV have something to do with Senpai and the announcer's death!?<br/>
Well…? What do you think…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>At first I'd thought Yosuke was grasping at straws out of grief, but there was some definite sense to it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> …So it's not just me, huh?<br/>
If there is a connection, then it's a good bet that the two of them went inside that world.<br/>
That would explain the posters in that room.<br/>
Which means… if we look around, we might find a place that has something to do with Senpai, too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Yosuke, don't tell me…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah… I'm thinking about going in again. I want to find out for myself.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> D-Don't do this… You should just let the police hand this and-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> You think we can rely on the police!? They haven't made any progress on the announcer's case.<br/>
Besides, even if we told them about the world inside the TV, there's no way they're gonna believe us!<br/>
If I'm completely off-base with this, that's fine…<br/>
It's just… I need to know why Senpai had to die like this.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Oh, Yosuke…<br/>
<br/>
<i>He was right, though, if it was true that the death had something to do with the other world, the police were going to be useless.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00092.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Sorry… but you're the only person who can help me.<br/>
I'm gonna go get ready. I'll be waiting for you at Junes.<br/>
&gt; Yosuke has asked you to take him into the TV world again…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> I can kinda understand how he feels…<br/>
But we can't be sure we'll be able to get out safely again.<br/>
What should we do…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was inclined to help him out, but I did want a second opinion.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> W-Wha? Huh? M-Me?<br/>
I…<br/>
Uh… Anyways, let's go to Junes. We can't leave Yosuke alone…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed to Junes. Yosuke had made some 'preparations' in the mean time.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> We came to stop you, idiot!<br/>
C'mon… You really shouldn't do this. It's too dangerous.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> I know… But we were able to come back once, right?<br/>
If we go in from the same location, maybe we'll meet that bear again.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> "Maybe" isn't good enough!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Look, I can't just act like everyone else and pretend this has nothing to do with me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> That's true, but…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> What about you? Could you just walk away?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I knew I couldn't, but Chie… I don't want to see someone else put in danger here.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00113.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; There's no telling what may happen over there…<br/>
&gt; You voiced your concern over Chie coming along.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, it'll be just you and me.<br/>
Don't worry, I'm not going in without a plan. Chie, I'm leaving you in charge of this.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Huh? What's that? A rope…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> We'll go in with this tied to me, so I want you to hold on to this and wait here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Wh-What? Then, is this a lifeline? C'mon, wait a sec…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Here, Souji… This is for you.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke handed me a golf club and some bandages and ointment he'd picked up.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00125.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Alright… Let's go. There's no use wasting any more time.<br/>
Chie, whatever you do, don't let go of the rope!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> H-Hey! I said wait!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We stepped into the TV…</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Is this…?<br/>
Look, this is the same place as last time! So they are connected from place to place!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> Y-You guys… Why'd you come back…?<br/>
I get it! You're the ones behind this!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> You're that thing from last time…!<br/>
Wait, what the hell did you just say!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> Lately, I can tell someone's been throwing people in here.<br/>
It's making this world more and more messed up…<br/>
This is the second time you guys came here. And I don't think anyone forced you in.<br/>
That means you're the most suspicious!<br/>
You guys must be the ones throwing the people in here, raaaawr!<br/>
<br/>
<i>What do you say when a bear is calling you a killer?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00146.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> What're you talking about, "throwing people in"!?<br/>
If someone was thrown in here and they couldn't get out, they might die!<br/>
Who would do such a-<br/>
Wait a sec…<br/>
All this talk about someone throwing people in here…<br/>
Does he mean Senpai and the announcer?<br/>
Did that "someone" throw those two in here?<br/>
H-Hey… What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I had to agree.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00155.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah… I agree.<br/>
Let's assume he's telling the truth…<br/>
Could it be that someone's throwing people in here, intending to kill them…?<br/>
If that's the case…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> What're you guys mumbling about? Why'd you come here, anyways!?<br/>
It's a one-way door! You can't get out once you're in!<br/>
Remember? How I had to let you guys out?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, whatever.<br/>
We don't need your help this time! See, this time we have a lifeli-<br/>
<br/>
<i>That was when we noticed the line had broken as we entered.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00166.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> H-Hey! You better let us out once we're done investigating here!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> Grrrrr! I'm the one who wants to investigate!<br/>
I've lived here for a long time. But it's never been noisy like this till now.<br/>
Do you have proof!? Prove to me that you're not throwing people in here!<br/>
<br/>
<i>How the hell were we supposed to prove that?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00171.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> See! So it is you guys!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> For the last time, it's not us, so we've go nothing to prove to you!<br/>
Hey, you better answer our questions. This isn't like last time, when we came by accident. We're dead serious!<br/>
Listen up, 'cause people have died in our world… Every time the fog appears, a dead body shows up with it.<br/>
It has to be related to this place somehow! If you know something, tell us!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> A dead body? Whenever the fog appears…?<br/>
I know that if it's foggy on your side, the fog lifts here.<br/>
It's really dangerous when the fog lifts. That's when the Shadows get violent.<br/>
Aaaah… I get it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Huh…? If you get it, then explain it to us, dammit!<br/>
If it's foggy on our side, it isn't in here…? Shadows get violent…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> That's why I said to hurry back! It's dangerous when that happens!<br/>
<br/>
<i>The bear was firmly convinced we were the killers.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00185.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> I know you guys did it! You better stop right now!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> I've told you and told you, we're not the ones doing it!<br/>
I've about had it with you… Why the hell won't you listen to what we're saying!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> I-I'm just saying… you might be the culprits.<br/>
I'm just making sure…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> What…? Man, this bear's driving me nuts…<br/>
What is this place, anyways? It looks like a TV studio…<br/>
Is something being filmed here…?<br/>
H-Hey, don't tell me… Is that weird show being filmed here!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> Weird show? Filmed? What does that mean?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Uh… I'm asking if someone's been filming the people that get thrown in here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> ……? I don't get it…<br/>
This world has always been like this. No one has ever done that filming thing here.<br/>
<br/>
<i>None of this made any damn sense.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00199.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> Only me and Shadows are here! I told you before!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Ugh… We don't know what these Shadow things are! Or what you are either, for that matter!<br/>
You keep telling us to prove our innocence, but you're the most suspicious thing here!<br/>
Maybe you're the real culprit!<br/>
And what's with that stupid costume!? I'd say it's time you showed your face!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke grabbed the bear's head…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00205.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>And pulled…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00206.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>What the hell…?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00207.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Wh-What the hell are you…?<br/>
I-It's empty inside…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> Me…? The culprit…? I wouldn't do such a thing…<br/>
I just live here…<br/>
I just want to live here peacefully…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> Okay. I'll believe that you guys aren't the culprits.<br/>
But I want you to find the real guy who did all this. You have to stop him.<br/>
Promise me, or else…<br/>
<br/>
<i>He had a very effective threat.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00217.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Y-You little…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> This can't keep going on! My home here will be a complete mess!<br/>
And then… and then… I…<br/>
Waaah…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Wh-What're you crying for all of a sudden?<br/>
Geez, this thing's really weirding me out…<br/>
&gt; The mysterious bear is asking you to find the culprit behind this…<br/>
&gt; Someone on the outside is throwing people into this world…<br/>
&gt; If the culprit isn't you, he wants you to find the real culprit…<br/>
&gt; The mysterious bear seems serious about this…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> *sigh * Hey, what should we do?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Now it all made sense. That damn dream.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-P4-00229.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Igor.png"/> It seems you will encounter a misfortune at your destination, and a great mystery will be imposed upon you…<br/>
&gt; Could this be the mystery that will be thrust upon you…?<br/>
&gt; What was the "contract" Igor spoke of…?<br/>
&gt; Could finding the culprit and solving the case be part of this promise…?<br/>
&gt; In any case, since you cannot leave the TV world on your own, there seems to be no other option…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> You're the only ones I can ask. Will you promise me…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Fate, destiny, whatever you call it. I didn't really buy into that shit before, but this was an awful coincidence.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-P4-00236.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> Th-Thank you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Damn bear… Practically holding a gun to our heads…<br/>
But… it's true that we came here to figure things out. So far, we're completely in the dark.<br/>
Look for the culprit, huh…? Bring it on! You got my word, too.<br/>
Might as well introduce ourselves… I'm Yosuke Hanamura, and this is my buddy, Souji Seta.<br/>
You got a name?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Should have seen this coming.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-P4-00243.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> *groan * Figures…<br/>
But how are we supposed to find the culprit in the first place?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> I dunno…<br/>
Oh, but I know where the last person came in.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> The last person…? You mean Saki-senpai!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> I mean the person who came in and disappeared last time. I dunno the name.<br/>
I'll take you there. You might find clues.<br/>
Oh, one thing first. You two should put these on.<br/>
What're these classes for…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>We put on the glasses, and the difference was amazing!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-P4-00253.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Whoa!<br/>
The difference is like night and day… With these on, it's like the fog doesn't exist.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> They'll help you walk through the fog.<br/>
…Well, I've been here for a long time. So you can rely on me!<br/>
Uh… But I can only show you where the place is. You guys will have to defend yourselves.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> What happened to relying on you!? Th-There better not be any monsters! You understand!?<br/>
We brought weapons, but I mean… They're more for show!<br/>
We just got here! If it's so dangerous, why don't you do something instead of relying on us!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> Uh uh. No way. I've got no muscles.<br/>
Oh! Oh! I'll give you guys moral support from a safe distance!<br/>
How's that sound?<br/>
&gt; Can Teddie really not fight…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided to test that out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-P4-00266.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yeah, he can't fight.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-P4-00267.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> I-Is this thing for real!?<br/>
Ugh, this is so lame…<br/>
We swore to find the culprit, and this is all the backup we get…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> …Oh yeah. Can I ask you something?<br/>
Who's this Saki-senpai person? Someone you know?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> ……<br/>
That doesn't matter right now…<br/>
Anyways, at least now we know Senpai might have been thrown in here.<br/>
Maybe we can find more information, too. Let's get moving, Souji.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> W-Waaaait!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We picked Teddie up and headed off. We had no idea of the ordeal that would await us…</i><br/>
