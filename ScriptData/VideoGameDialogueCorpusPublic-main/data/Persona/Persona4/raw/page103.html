<br/>
&gt; This is where you had spent so many afternoons going over the case with everyone…<br/>
&gt; Just sitting here brings back a lot of memories…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Huh!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Teddie2.png"/> What a coincidence… It must be destiny!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Ah, so you guys came here too!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> It's our very own special headquarters… There are so many memories here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Yo there, Senpai! Thought you'd be here!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Rise.png"/> We had a feeling we'd run into everyone if we came here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Naoto.png"/> We were planning on seeing you off at the station tomorrow…<br/>
But I was feeling too restless, so I decided to come here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Well, since we're all here, why don't we have something to eat?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Ooh, let's have steak! Steak! And make Yosuke pay for everything!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Will you shut up about your steaks…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We didn't make Yosuke pay for absolutely everything.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Teddie2.png"/> I really had fun in this world.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Dude, your whole existence is about fun.<br/>
…Well, what we've gone through wasn't all fun and games, but I gotta say… I've never felt so fulfilled in my life.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> It seems we've been working on this forever… but at the same time, it felt like it went so fast.<br/>
We won't ever gather here again like this… or tear our hair out trying to solve the mysteries…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> Even if we wanted to talk about it all, there were so many extraordinary things that no one would believe us.<br/>
Come to think of it… For me, I think it all started when Chie told me about the Midnight Channel.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I think I heard about it from her too.<br/>
How did you learn about it, Chie?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> I guess… it was just a random rumor? A lot of girls were trying it out.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Huh. I wonder how it started, then.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Who knows…? Maybe someone accidentally came across it?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> The Midnight Channel… You know, that really was the cause of everything.<br/>
I mean, the fog lifted after we caught Adachi, but there's still a lot of stuff that isn't clear yet.<br/>
It's foggy over there, too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Teddie2.png"/> Hmm… Some weird guy might use it to do bad things again.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Didn't that Ameno-something monster say…<br/>
…it granted us power…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Naoto.png"/> "I bestowed power onto those who could brave the hollow forest."<br/>
In other words, he gave the power to enter TVs to those who awakened to their Persona ability…<br/>
So that he might use us as pawns to enact his scheme.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie is seriously an ace detective, she'll make a great cop.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Does that mean you're an exception…?<br/>
Well wait, then what about Adachi and Namatame!?<br/>
Those two could go inside TVs before all this stuff about Personas, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Rise.png"/> What? Then Senpai and the other two could do it for some other reason?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> There must be something you're not remembering. Anything come to your mind, Senpai?<br/>
&gt; You're the only exception…<br/>
&gt; You had the power to enter TVs before your Persona awakened…<br/>
&gt; And the same goes for Adachi and Namatame…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You remember that Nanako gave you something this morning as you were about to leave…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> A letter…? Hey, this better not be another warning.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It wasn't, but it was from the same sender.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Huh…? This is… from jail!?<br/>
It's from Adachi!<br/>
<b>Letter from Adachi:</b> I'm sure you're surprised to get this letter out of the blue.<br/>
I'm writing this because there's something I need to tell you.<br/>
Ever since I made it out alive, there are some things I understand now.<br/>
It's true that my game's over.<br/>
As you all insisted at the time, I'll abide by the rules of this world.<br/>
But as long as I'm in stir here, I can't clean up after myself.<br/>
So I hope this will give you something to think about, regarding this case.<br/>
There's still this feeling I can't shake…<br/>
It's about how it all started... about that Midnight Channel.<br/>
Now I remember… Someone told me about it when I first came to town… before I heard the rumors at the station.<br/>
And I was intrigued when I noticed that something similar was written on Namatame's reports as well.<br/>
But… I can't remember who it was that told me.<br/>
Since Namatame and I both gained our power after coming to Inaba… I have a feeling that has something to do with it.<br/>
I don't know if any of this will be useful or not… But I hope it can help somehow.<br/>
&gt; The letter from Adachi ends there.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Hmm… It's not very helpful to know that he can't remember who it was.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke had been thinking on the same subject it seemed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> It's like… Argh, I don't know how to say this…<br/>
Like, something's connecting all these things… Something beyond what we can see.<br/>
That world, the Midnight Channel, the ability to enter TVs… They all feel like separate things.<br/>
You know what I mean? First the rumors, then the serial murder, followed by us deciding to investigate the case…<br/>
If they all really were separate, they wouldn't fit together like this, right?<br/>
There has to be some kind of "conductor" behind everything.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> So you think the person Adachi mentioned, the one who told him about the Midnight Channel, is that conductor?<br/>
Uhhh… Did I strike gold again? I-It's seriously just something that popped into my head!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Naoto.png"/> Senpai, is there anything like that you can think of?<br/>
&gt; The power to enter TVs, where everything about this case started…<br/>
&gt; You learned about the Midnight Channel from Chie a few days after coming to this town when she told you the rumor.<br/>
&gt; But Adachi and Namatame heard about the Midnight Channel from someone immediately after coming to this town…<br/>
&gt; When you think back… you feel as if something happened to you as well upon you arrival here…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still, that was the better part of a year ago. I knew there was something but I just couldn't remember what.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00084.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Naoto.png"/> We were involved in a murder case last year, which we succeeded in solving.<br/>
But the monster we fought last said we did well in "playing our parts"…<br/>
Perhaps this means Adachi and Namatame were "players" as well.<br/>
Could it be that from the beginning, this serial murder case was merely a portion of a much larger scheme…?<br/>
And none of the people who were directly involved in the case ever suspected it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, this "scheme"…<br/>
Could it be the whole thing about filling both worlds with the fog and turning mankind into Shadows?<br/>
So someone was behind the scenes watching us, the culprits, and maybe even that monster…?<br/>
And he manipulated Adachi and Namatame as the very beginning so everything would come together perfectly…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Naoto.png"/> Let's go out into town. We might find something.<br/>
Although… you may be the only one capable of noticing it.<br/>
Please contact the rest of us, should you come across anything.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> We can't say our goodbyes tomorrow with this hanging over our heads! Let's go figure this out!<br/>
&gt; …Who could've given you the initial "spark" for this power…?<br/>
&gt; The one you met immediately after coming to town was…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was sure the first person I saw in town was Dojima, which gave me a starting point for reconstructing that first day.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; …In any case, you need to see them and confirm the truth.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I guessed Dojima and Nanako might be by the Samegawa, and was rewarded for my intuition.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Souji.png"/> I want to talk to you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Dojima.png"/> Mm… What's this all of a sudden?<br/>
&gt; You asked Dojima about the first day you arrived in town.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Dojima.png"/> The day you first came to town…?<br/>
Hmm, let's see... We were the first ones to greet you, right?<br/>
Did we stop somewhere on the way home…?<br/>
I'm pretty sure me and Nanako left home that afternoon, picked you up, and came straight home.<br/>
Haha… Now that I think back to that night, I was called back to work as soon as we got home, so I couldn't talk much.<br/>
And the very next day, those strange murders started…<br/>
Sheesh… A lot's happened since then. It's been one heck of a year, hasn't it?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> Hey, big bro. On the first day… Didn't we stop at that place…?<br/>
…The gas station. I used the bathroom there.<br/>
When I got back to the car, you were talking to the weird attendant.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'd almost forgotten that person. I hadn't seen them around town much, last time I really remembered was before the fog came.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00117.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> Yeah. When I first met you, I remembered the gas station attendant because he was weird.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Dojima.png"/> Hmm, not that you mention it, I do remember that… I filled the tank before we went home, huh?<br/>
…Ah, yeah. I do remember you talking to the attendant there.<br/>
I didn't remember seeing him much before, so he stuck in my mind.<br/>
But I don't know about calling him "weird"… It wasn't like he looked or acted funny.<br/>
Yeah… Come to think of it, I never saw that guy again…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> Umm, it wasn't really that the attendant looked weird…<br/>
But after you talked to him, you looked sick, big bro.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I sort of remembered when she said something about it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00126.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> Umm, don't you remember? I asked you on the way home, "Are you carsick?"<br/>
You said you were okay, but…<br/>
That attendant… He was just a little scary for some reason.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Dojima.png"/> Hmm… I didn't know about that.<br/>
But honestly, I'm surprised you're asking all these questions. I thought you came here just to reminisce.<br/>
So why are you looking for the person you met first?<br/>
Is something going on with that attendant? Do you know him?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Souji.png"/> It's no big deal.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Dojima.png"/> …I see. Well, just remember that you leave tomorrow.<br/>
I don't know what you're up to, but you should come back home early.<br/>
There are some dark clouds on the horizon… We might get some rain soon.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Souji.png"/> I understand.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> …Okay.<br/>
&gt; The first place you stopped when you came to town was the gas station…<br/>
&gt; Maybe something there will jog your memory…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I went to the shopping district, but the attendant wasn't there. I even asked around about them.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Spacy Girl:</b> I've only seen an older man and an older woman working there…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Then I thought this through, and decided I had no chance without some supernatural backup. So I returned to the Velvet Room.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Igor.png"/> How may I help you?<br/>
You have solved the mystery and deflected the disaster that so nearly fell upon you.<br/>
Is there something else beyond this you need our assistance with?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Souji.png"/> There's one last thing…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Igor.png"/> Intriguing… So, is there still something that leaves you unsatisfied?<br/>
Hmmm… What may that be?<br/>
Well then… Let's take a look and see what it is you might be sensing.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Margaret.png"/> ……!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Igor.png"/> Ah, this is a surprise…<br/>
These are shards of power, allowing one to see through to the truth of things without being swayed by hollow rumors.<br/>
Interesting… Indeed you have come here today for a reason.<br/>
Then I shall play my part as well.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Igor combined the shards into a single orb.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00157.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Igor.png"/> …An orb that repels fabrications of all sorts, dispels lies, and shines upon the truth.<br/>
&gt; Obtained Orb of Sight.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Margaret.png"/> Truth is a thing which only appears to those who have observed, considered, and made a choice.<br/>
At the end of the path you chose lies the truth… Believe in it, and continue without faltering.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Igor.png"/> *chuckle * How marvelous…<br/>
It seems that you will reveal the journey's true end, one beyond our predictive power.<br/>
Now go… To the place where everything began…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And when I left the Velvet Room, the rain started…</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>And even though they'd not been there before, the attendant was at the station.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00166.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Souji.png"/> Isn't this where I first…?<br/>
<b>Attendant:</b> First…? What are you talking about?<br/>
…Oh, is this about the part-time job? I'm sorry, we don't have an opening yet.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Souji.png"/> Do you know Namatame?<br/>
<b>Attendant:</b> ……?<br/>
…Ah, that serial murder suspect? A real tragedy, wasn't it?<br/>
But the case was solved, right? Thank goodness.<br/>
……? Something else I can help you with?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Souji.png"/> Did those two come here?<br/>
<b>Attendant:</b> ……<br/>
…Well, that's a weird question to ask.<br/>
I don't know if it was right here, but I might have met them before.<br/>
…I've been in this town for a long time, so yeah, there's a good chance.<br/>
But it's not like I knew them personally.<br/>
……<br/>
…If you've got nothing else, you mind leaving me alone…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was starting to get sick of the run-around.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00184.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Attendant:</b> *chuckle * Hey…<br/>
I asked you to leave me alone… Did you miss that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Souji.png"/> Did you do anything do them?<br/>
<b>Attendant:</b> Huh…?<br/>
To those two?<br/>
……<br/>
Ah… That's right, I remember now.<br/>
I think I met them when they first came to town.<br/>
So I greeted them, saying, "Welcome to Inaba."<br/>
But that's all.<br/>
…Just that.<br/>
*chuckle * What about it?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Souji.png"/> What did you do to me?<br/>
<b>Attendant:</b> What did I do? *chuckle * Don't you remember?<br/>
I met you here when you first came to down, and did the same thing as what I did to those two.<br/>
I greeted you, that's all. Remember? We talked for a couple minutes.<br/>
…Hey, mind if I ask you something?<br/>
Why all these questions?<br/>
Is there something that's bothering you? About the time when we first met…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I just asked straight out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00206.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Attendant:</b> ……<br/>
Hmhm…<br/>
…Ahahahaha!<br/>
Amazing…<br/>
…You've reached me at last.<br/>
*chuckle * Let's drop this charade…<br/>
To be quite honest, I was waiting for you to come…<br/>
Adachi…<br/>
Namatame…<br/>
And you…<br/>
It is I who awakened that power within you three…<br/>
The ones who had potential.<br/>
But having said that, I am rather surprised…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I had come looking for answers, but even still I didn't expect what happened.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00220.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Incognito.png"/> You certainly have the powers I was expecting.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Souji.png"/> Why did you choose me?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Incognito.png"/> For your special potential, of course.<br/>
Your friends were drawn to the spark I stirred in you. That's why they are here now with their awakened powers.<br/>
Still, I didn't think you'd make it all the way to me…<br/>
Indeed, I never expected this at all. You're really something.<br/>
…What, you don't remember?<br/>
When you first came to town, I gave your power a gentle push.<br/>
Just like… this.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Just then, I remembered the handshake she'd given me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00233.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Incognito.png"/> Does it surprise a city boy to see how little there is out here?<br/>
There's so little to do, I'm sure you'll get bored fast. You'll either be hanging out with your friends or doing part-time jobs.<br/>
Speaking of which, we're actually looking for part-time help right now.<br/>
Give it some thought, why don't you? We don't mind if you're a student.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I started to get dizzy as she continued.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00239.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Incognito.png"/> I did the same for a few other outsiders like you.<br/>
A handful of strangers were more than sufficient to stimulate a small place like this.<br/>
But it seems the stimulus was stronger than I imagined-enough to envelop this town with fog, and later lift it…<br/>
Not only that, you now stand before me as if your assigned part wasn't enough. What for?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Souji.png"/> To learn the truth.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Incognito.png"/> What will grasping the truth do for you?<br/>
Why such greed? I guess it's the foolish nature of being mortal…<br/>
<br/>
<i>The fog rolled in…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00247.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>And the attendant… changed…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-P4-00248.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>And revealed her true identity.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-P4-00249.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Izanami.png"/> Ameno-sagiri, ruler of the fog, is merely an aspect of myself that I birthed long ago.<br/>
You awakened to a power I had not imagined.<br/>
And now you face me with it…<br/>
I can no longer ignore this situation as mere foolishness. This may be fate, as decreed by the world…<br/>
Very well. This time, I shall pit my full strength against you.<br/>
But in return… you must come prepared to follow through with your futile resistance.<br/>
*chuckle * I'll be waiting for you there.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Izanami vanished into the fog.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-P4-00257.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Her name is Izanami.<br/>
&gt; You can hear your friends' voices in the distance…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was glad they'd seen something too, I was worried for a second that I'd just gone crazy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-P4-00260.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Did she… just disappear!?<br/>
Wait, don't tell me…!<br/>
&gt; You told your gathered friends what happened between you and the gas station attendant…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> So… it wasn't over after all.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> You're saying this so-called Izanami is the conductor, and she's waiting for us in the other world?<br/>
If we don't beat her, I'm sure it'll all happen again.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> O-Okay. The others aren't far off, so I'll call them up!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, will ya? Tell 'em this is really gonna close the case!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> Right. We'll defeat her, and put an end to this for sure this time!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Alright, then once we're all ready, let's meet up at Junes!<br/>
&gt; You have finally discovered the true cause of everything that happened.<br/>
&gt; You must defeat this "Izanami" who waits for you in that other world…<br/>
&gt; If Izanami truly gave birth to Ameno-sagiri…<br/>
&gt; Then as long as Izanami is left alone, the town will definitely fall into the fog again someday…<br/>
&gt; And if that were to happen, everyone… all those precious to you… would become mere shadows.<br/>
&gt; This is the most important task you have faced, and it must be taken care of before leaving town.<br/>
