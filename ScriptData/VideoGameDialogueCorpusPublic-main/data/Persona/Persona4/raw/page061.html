			<b>9/18/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>Just sort of chilled out today. Rise and I went down to Okina, not much happened. Later on, Dojima was doing some work. I decided to see what he was up to.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&gt; It looks like data about cars…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Dojima.png"/> Sorry, but my hands are full here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> Want some coffee?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Dojima.png"/> …That's my job. Don't worry about it.<br/>
&gt; Dojima is smiling wryly.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Dojima.png"/> Oh yeah, I was thinking about this when talking with Nanako just now, but…<br/>
I feel like she's changed a bit lately.<br/>
I don't know how to put it… She's stronger.<br/>
…I feel like I'm being left behind…<br/>
Ever since you came, this house has become, well… home-y.<br/>
A house isn't just a big box. It's a place for a family to live together.<br/>
Laughing, crying, fighting… Spending most of your lived together…<br/>
A warm place.<br/>
I forgot what that was like…<br/>
I wanted to get that back more than anything… And yet, I feel like I've been dodging it the whole time.<br/>
Do you understand why?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I sort of wanted to say that he was running away from it but couldn't quite get it out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Dojima.png"/> …That's right.<br/>
But I never thought of her feelings…<br/>
&gt; Dojima is smiling wryly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Dojima.png"/> We've been in the same place, but we weren't connected. You brought the two of us together.<br/>
The rest… is my problem. Where do I draw the line with this…?<br/>
&gt; You felt Dojima's quiet determination…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's good that Dojima's finally thinking about how much this is hurting Nanako.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Dojima.png"/> Ahhh, screw this! I'm drinking tonight!<br/>
Souji, you're drinking with me. Alcohol-free, of course.<br/>
You pass out before me, and you're under arrest, got it!? Alright!<br/>
&gt; You drank with Dojima until he passed out and went to your room…<br/>
<br/>
<b>9/19/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>It was Respect for the Aged Day, which made me think about Hisano.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Hisano.png"/> The more I look at you, the more you remind me of him.<br/>
His nose was just a little lower than yours, and his eyes a bit smaller, and his hair was shorter…<br/>
Haha, he was a handsome man.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> Who are you talking about?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Hisano.png"/> Haha… My husband.<br/>
He was a kind man. Quite an attractive one, too…<br/>
&gt; Hisano smiles nostalgically…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Hisano.png"/> My husband passed away recently…<br/>
Do I look like Death to you?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I still have no idea what she's talking about.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Hisano.png"/> I see…<br/>
…You mustn't become Death.<br/>
&gt; Hisano smiles sadly…<br/>
&gt; You feel you brushed against a heavy weight that Hisano is bearing…<br/>
<br/>
<i>But she's so very sad about something.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Hisano.png"/> When I'm with you, I feel like he has forgiven me…<br/>
That can't possibly be true, though…<br/>
After all, I'm the one who…<br/>
……<br/>
…I'll see you later, Souji-chan.<br/>
&gt; You left Hisano and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>When I got home, Nanako was looking around for something.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Nanako.png"/> What should I do…? The teacher will yell at me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> I'll help you look for it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Nanako.png"/> Thank you, big bro.<br/>
&gt; Nanako seems ready to cry with distress…<br/>
&gt; You decide to search the house.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I looked through Dojima's papers, and found more than I bargained for.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00077.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; ……?<br/>
&gt; A paper titled "Parent Survey Regarding Scheduling of Parent-Teacher Interviews" was hidden among them…<br/>
&gt; The word "Anytime" has been written in the "Day Requested" box…<br/>
&gt; Is this the paper Nanako was looking for…?<br/>
&gt; …?<br/>
&gt; There's something else hidden in the papers.<br/>
&gt; It seems to be a photo…<br/>
&gt; You decide to show it to Nanako.<br/>
<br/>
<i>She was pretty surprised by what I found.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00086.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Nanako looks at the paper on the table…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Nanako.png"/> It says "Anytime" on it.<br/>
So… he can come anytime?<br/>
I see… *giggle *<br/>
And this is… a photo?<br/>
Oh, this is…<br/>
Mom…<br/>
This little baby in the middle… That's me…<br/>
Dad's smiling…<br/>
……<br/>
Why did Dad stop smiling…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's hard to explain to a kid what's wrong with Dojima, I tried my best.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Nanako.png"/> Dad's… lonely…?<br/>
I see.. So that's it…<br/>
&gt; Nanako has realized something.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Nanako.png"/> After Mom died, I was loney, but…<br/>
I'm not the only one who's sad that Mom's not here any more…<br/>
Dad… He was lonely, too… I'm sorry, Dad.<br/>
&gt; Nanako looks more mature, somehow…<br/>
&gt; You feel that your relationship with Nanako has grown deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think she got it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00108.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Nanako.png"/> Thank you, big bro.<br/>
…Will Dad ever smile like this again?<br/>
&gt; Nanako stares at the photo…<br/>
&gt; It's getting late, so you put Nanako to bed and went to your own room.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I just need to try and get Dojima and Nanako to talk about this.</i>
