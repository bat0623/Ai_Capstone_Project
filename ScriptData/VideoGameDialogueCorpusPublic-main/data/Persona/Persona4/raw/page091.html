<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Igor.png"/> Welcome.<br/>
It's been quite some time…<br/>
&gt; It seems you've been summoned to the Velvet Room…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Igor.png"/> Do not be alarmed. You are fast asleep in the real world…<br/>
I have summoned you within your dreams.<br/>
Now then… Your journey has taken you quite a distance thus far.<br/>
Do you believe you'll be able to successfully solve this mystery…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>We've come so far, there's no way I'm giving up now.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Igor.png"/> Splendid.<br/>
The precise destination of this vehicle… That, too, is getting rather hard to judge.<br/>
If we continue driving blindly, we may end up leading you further away from the mystery that you must reach…<br/>
Well…? Why don't we take a moment to look back on your journey?<br/>
It was for that purpose that I summoned you here tonight.<br/>
Margaret?<br/>
&gt; Voices you've heard many times before echo in your mind…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Daisuke.png"/> Yeah, well, I quit pretending.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Sayoko.png"/> What's right… What you should choose to do in life… The answers to those things lie within you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yumi.png"/> You gave me the strength to start walking.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Igor.png"/> We are experiencing the words engraved into your memory during your journey…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Alright. Let's go ahead and think this through as much as we need.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> If we leave any unanswered questions behind, we'll just be lying to ourselves…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Rise.png"/> I'll think as hard as I can, and try to help!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chie.png"/> C'mon, we've accomplished this much together, haven't we?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yukiko.png"/> Right… Together.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Igor.png"/> And it seems you have comrades with you as well… Those heading in the same direction through this dense fog.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Just then, the limo stopped.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Margaret.png"/> We'll be parked for the moment while I confirm our current heading.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Igor.png"/> As I mentioned previously, this year will signal a great change in your life.<br/>
Though there isn't much time left, it can be worth your while to take the time to stop and reflect.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Margaret.png"/> People are like water flowing in a river. There is only one stream, but all who pass through it are affected differently.<br/>
Some travel fast, some change their course… Experiencing countless events as they travel down the river of time…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Igor.png"/> Just so.<br/>
The state of this room reflects the scenery of your heart…<br/>
Perhaps this may be a time for contemplation rather than action…<br/>
&gt; You can hear something in the distance…<br/>
&gt; It seems that you've been sleeping until now…<br/>
&gt; You hear the doorbell ringing…<br/>
&gt; Someone seems to be at the door…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was Yosuke, and his news wasn't good.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> I looked all over the neighborhood, but I couldn't fine him anywhere…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Souji.png"/> I'm worried.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, me too. He was acting all weird lately…<br/>
Rise and the others are checking inside the TV to see if he's gone back to the other side.<br/>
We're meeting pretty soon, so will you come with me to Junes?<br/>
&gt; Where could Teddie have gone…?<br/>
&gt; …In any case, you decide to go look for him.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We couldn't find Teddie anywhere, though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Rise.png"/> No luck for me either… I didn't sense anything over there. The fog's so dense, it might be affecting my readings.<br/>
I wish I could do better… I'm sorry.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> That Ted… Don't tell me he really went back to his world this time…<br/>
We told him over and over that he could stay here…<br/>
&gt; You recall the mysterious dream you had last night…<br/>
&gt; "This may be a time for contemplation rather than action…" That is what Igor said but…<br/>
<br/>
<i>There was nothing more we could do, we just had to trust that Teddie knew what he was doing and would come back to us when the time was right. We had other things to deal with.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> I guess that's all we can do right now…<br/>
He plays dumb a lot, but he's attached to us deep down… He wouldn't disappear without saying anything, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> I'm worried for Teddie myself, but let's trust in him and await his return. Right now, we must concentrate on the case.<br/>
It won't be long before Namatame is transferred to another location.<br/>
We must hurry, or we will miss our only chance to get his perspective on this.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Y'know, I've been thinking about the case since, but something just doesn't seem right…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> Let's quickly review the facts.<br/>
Of all the victims, only two were killed: Ms. Yamano, the announcer, and Saki-san.<br/>
From the documents we found in the car, we know Namatame had some sort of dealings with them.<br/>
After that, there were multiple attempted murders, in which we were targeted…<br/>
It was only when he took Nanako-chan that we caught him in the act, identifying his modus operandi in the process.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> When I hear you put it like that, sounds like the dude's guilty.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> As a result of Namatame's arrest, the police admitted that Mitsuo Kubo was a mere copycat killer.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Back up to yesterday… Remember when you said Namatame didn't have a motive to kill the announcer?<br/>
That's what's bothering me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Rise.png"/> Right… Either he's completely nuts, or we're misunderstanding something…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> …You lost me.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh, Kanji. But I have to say I'm glad we didn't throw Namatame into the TV now.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Rise.png"/> Sane or insane… Sounds like a play I saw before.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> When he talks about "saving" people, what does that actually mean?<br/>
I don't think there's any doubt that it includes kidnapping people and throwing them into the TV.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> Could he mean… saving them through death…?<br/>
He did call himself a "savior," and said that the other side is a "wonderful world."<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> So they'll be saved if they die? What a bunch of crap… The bastard shoulda gone and "saved" himself.<br/>
Whaddya think, Senpai?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I already was thinking that didn't quite fit all of what he'd said and done, though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00081.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> If you think about it normally, it's gotta be him… But there ain't nothin' normal about that world anyways…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yukiko.png"/> There's something I've been wondering about for a while.<br/>
When we first encountered him, he said…<br/>
"You're the ones I saved. Don't worry, I'll save this girl too…"<br/>
So um… If he "saves" people by killing them, did he save us too?<br/>
Wouldn't he actually have failed to save us…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> You raise a good point. If he thinks that salvation comes only through death, his words to us make no sense…<br/>
And another thing… The Namatame who appeared on the Midnight Channel said he failed to save Nanako-chan.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chie.png"/> Well, maybe he really was trying to save the victims by putting them inside the TV.<br/>
C-C'mon, don't get all quiet like that… You guys know I just say the first dumb thing that pops into my head… Haha…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> The possibility that he truly intended to save us…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> But he's still the one who threw in Saki-senpai and that announcer, right!?<br/>
Sure, we haven't nailed down his motives, but that doesn't change the fact that he killed them.<br/>
Or what, you think someone else was involved? What makes you think so?<br/>
&gt; The possibility of a culprit besides Namatame…<br/>
&gt; Could there be something that proves this possibility…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>If he thinks he's saving people, then why would he threaten us to stop rescuing people from the TV world?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00098.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Warning letter…? Oh yeah… Whatever happened to that thing?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chie.png"/> If Namatame's the killer, he must've been the one who wrote it, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> Let's review them…<br/>
&gt; You recall that the first warning letter said, "dont rescue anymore"…<br/>
&gt; And the second one said, "if you dont stop this time, someone close will be put in and killed"…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> Yes, that's right.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Rise.png"/> Isn't that kinda odd?<br/>
Would someone who thinks he's saving people by killing them write stuff like "don't rescue" or "kill"?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> Yeah, and the "will be put in and killed" part doesn't make sense either…<br/>
If the killer was writing it, wouldn't it be more like "I'll put in and kill"?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chie.png"/> Hey… Could this mean…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Souji.png"/> Namatame didn't write it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chie.png"/> Yeah…<br/>
It's almost like… someone else wrote this letter…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yukiko.png"/> But only the killer would write such a letter and deliver it to Dojima-san's house, right?<br/>
If someone else wrote it, that could only mean…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> Dear god…<br/>
<br/>
<i>There was only one conclusion that fit the facts: There was another culprit who'd written the letter.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00116.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Rise.png"/> So Namatame really was trying to save his victims…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> Everything is exactly the opposite of what it first seemed…<br/>
In Namatame's parlance, "failing" would have been the first two cases, when the victims died.<br/>
If he had used his method twice, and failed both times, he would hardly have continued using the TV. And yet he did.<br/>
It all seems to suggest that someone else wrote this warning letter while observing the entire case…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Someone else… Then…<br/>
It wasn't Namatame that killed Saki-senpai and the announcer!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> We can't say for certain yet…<br/>
We urgently need to speak to Namatame face to face…<br/>
&gt; You all worked together to take another step toward the truth…<br/>
<br/>
<i>If we were right, speaking with Namatame could crack this case wide open. The problem would be getting to talk to him.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00127.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> How, though? After what happened yesterday, they said they're gonna tighten security.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> I have a plan.<br/>
But there's no time to waste. Let's hurry to the hospital!<br/>
