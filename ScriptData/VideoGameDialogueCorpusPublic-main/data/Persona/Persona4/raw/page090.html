<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> AAAAAGHH!!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> Nanako-chan…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Adachi.png"/> Dojima-san…? What's with  that look…?<br/>
Huh? What's wrong, everyone…?<br/>
……<br/>
Huh…? Wait… I-Is Nanako-chan…?<br/>
B-But then… where did Dojima-san go? His room isn't that way-<br/>
Wait a sec, that's the way to…!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We ran out when I heard Rise calling for us.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> Dojima-san might've gone after Namatame!<br/>
Adachi-san said he was admitted to this hospital!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> You transported him to the same hospital!? For crying out loud, he's the suspect in the case!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Adachi.png"/> Wh-What are you getting mad at me for? This is the biggest hospital, and he's in no condition to be moved…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Souji.png"/> Where is his room?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Adachi.png"/> I-I can't tell you that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> Just tell us where he is already!<br/>
Dojima-san's on his way, ain't he? You don't know what he's gonna do there if we don't stop him!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> Kanji-kun, you don't mean…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Adachi.png"/> H-Hold on… Just what are you guys talking about…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> Cought it up! Where's his room!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Adachi.png"/> Urgh… T-Top floor in the second surgical ward, furthest room back…<br/>
B-But… there's a police guard…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Meanwhile…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Teddie2.png"/> I was always watching over Nana-chan… And I still couldn't save her…<br/>
It happened in my world…<br/>
Even though I was the only Teddie in that place… I…<br/>
I still couldn't do anything…<br/>
I…<br/>
……<br/>
<br/>
<i>Elsewhere…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Policeman:</b> Like we said, without permission…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Dojima.png"/> Permission…?<br/>
Who gave him permission to kill Nanako? Tell me that, huh?<br/>
The hell with you all…!<br/>
Why is he still alive when Nanako's dead!?<br/>
Give me back Nanako… Give her back! She's… She's all I have…!<br/>
She's… the only one… in the world…<br/>
<b>Partner:</b> C-Call a doctor!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Dojima.png"/> Let go of me… I need to…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Adachi.png"/> Holy crap! Dojima-san!<br/>
Quick, get him to his room! I'll go alert the doctors!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We saw Dojima, Adachi, and the guards go by as we approached Namatame's room.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> His only daughter's dead… Nothing woulda surprised me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Dojima-san probably knew… that there's little to no chance Namatame would be convicted…<br/>
Dammit… He killed Senpai, and now Nanako-chan…<br/>
And the bastard's gonna walk away without paying for what he did…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> That's not right…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> Why…? Why is he the one that gets to go on living?<br/>
<br/>
<i>We heard a thump from Namatame's room, and rushed in.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>VIDEO- "Reason"</b><br/>

You Should Really Watch This</a><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The window in the room is wide open…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Souji.png"/> What are you doing?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Namatame.png"/> I-I was scared… So I… I…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> You have your life… and now you want your freedom, too!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> It's your fault that Nanako-chan's…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Namatame.png"/> I-I, I didn't, I…<br/>
<br/>
<i>That's when the bullshit started. The TV came on, it must have been midnight.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> Hey, isn't this…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Kunino_Sagiri.png"/> I failed to save her. It's because you got in my way.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Another Namatame…!?<br/>
How!? The real one's right here, and we already beat his Shadow…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> No… Come to think of it, Namatame never faced his other self.<br/>
And we didn't witness his Shadow returning to his body as a Persona, either…<br/>
Perhaps that's why we're seeing this now…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Namatame.png"/> What… the…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Kunino_Sagiri.png"/> I failed. But it wasn't my fault.<br/>
And the law can't touch me anyway…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Namatame.png"/> Wh-What…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> Is that what's Namatame's really thinking!?<br/>
Then… he wasn't deranged or anything… He knew what he was doing…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> To hell with the law… I won't ever forgive what you did…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Namatame.png"/> Th-This… Please… Stop…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> Huh? Stop what? We ain't even done anything yet…<br/>
Or do you want us to do something…? Something fitting for a bastard like you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> K-Kanji…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> ……<br/>
<br/>
<i>Some things were already starting to bother me, though. Like how the hell we were talking with the goddamn TV, when before we were never able to interact with anything on the Midnight Channel.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00083.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Kunino_Sagiri.png"/> I don't care either way. Living or dying makes no difference to me.<br/>
But you… You're different. *chuckle * You can't do such a thing. You wouldn't dare, right?<br/>
*chuckle * I'll continue "saving" people… It's my mission…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> Mission…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> My god…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Namatame.png"/> P-Please stop…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> He wants us to stop. What should we do?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> Wh-What do you mean…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> We can't let this bastard do whatever he pleases.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> Still… What are you going to do?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> No way I'm going to walk out of here doing nothing…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> I-I understand, but…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> This must be a luxury suite. Most hospital wards don't have such large televisions…<br/>
Why, with something like this in the room, this man could escape at any time…<br/>
Although once he enters… he may find there's no way out…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> Wait a second! Y-You don't mean…<br/>
Are you… serious…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> You just gonna turn your back and walk away?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> That's… But…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> Wh-What's gotten into you guys!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>But I was already damned sure of one thing. I wasn't going to let someone get murdered because of what some goddamn TV said. That's not what Nanako would want.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00104.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Chie!<br/>
Everyone… Listen to me.<br/>
If we're gonna do this… now is our only shot. We won't get a second chance.<br/>
At this rate, the guy's gonna get off the hook… And he'll go around "saving" people again!<br/>
You just heard what this bastard's really thinking!<br/>
If that happens, it'll be just like Nanako-chan and Senpai… Who knows how many innocent people will die this time?<br/>
I can't let something like that go…<br/>
Someone close to me died… Her killer can't be convicted… And now I'm gonna let the same thing happen again?<br/>
There's no way I can to that! It's just wrong, isn't it!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> B-But… Yosuke…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> All we have to do is push him inside the TV… That's it. We do that one thing, and this is all over.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> J-Just… push him inside…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> If any of you want no part in this, just leave the room. I'm not gonna force you to stay.<br/>
As for me, nothing could make me forgive this bastard… But before we do this, I want to hear what you think.<br/>
What do you want to do… Leader?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Besides, if we don't figure out why this fog is covering Inaba how many people might die? Namatame's our only lead.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00120.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> We don't have time to wait! If we don't do this now, the cops'll come back!<br/>
What're you trying to say!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>And anyway, even if we do listen to that Shadow, it said something that bothered me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00123.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Something we don't know…? What don't we know!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Because Nanako died, and Namatame knew that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00125.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> But we just heard the guy's true feelings on TV!<br/>
What didn't you understand!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>So why did he say he failed to save her?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00128.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Well, what is it!?<br/>
I already told you, there's no time to waste!<br/>
Are you even getting at something here, or are you just stalling!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>But Yosuke was really freaking the hell out, and wasn't thinking straight.</i><br/>
<br/>
 <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00132.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Missing…? Like what, exactly?<br/>
Dammit… I've heard enough of this bullshit! Give me a straight answer!<br/>
Are we doing this or not!? That's all I give a damn about right now!<br/>
<br/>
<i>He just wasn't listening to reason, so I kind of lost my cool.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00136.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You yelled at everyone to calm down.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Namatame.png"/> Nnngh…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> H-He's right. L-Let's all calm down for a second.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> I'm perfectly calm.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> Hey, what did you mean by "we're missing something"…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> What's there to miss with a sick bastard like him!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> Hey, let's all take a deep breath.<br/>
After what happened to Nanako-chan, and seeing Dojima-san… we're not thinking straight right now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> Tch… Fine…<br/>
&gt; Everyone took a deep breath.<br/>
&gt; It seems that everyone has finally regained their composure…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> You're right… We should calm down and think rationally about this…<br/>
I realize now that we've heard almost nothing from Namatame's perspective…<br/>
There's no denying that this man brought great harm to Nanako-chan…<br/>
But other than that point, the rest comes from our assumptions based on watching the Midnight Channel a moment ago.<br/>
I won't deny that we were blinded by the heat of the moment… trying to impute all responsibility to him rashly.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> But…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, the guy's not saying anything.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I can understand why Yosuke's so adamant about this, but none of it makes sense. I'm not going to disgrace Nanako's memory by killing a guy when there's still questions to be answered.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00156.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> It was him who put Senpai through that misery…<br/>
How can we possibly understand someone who says killing people is the same as "saving" them!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> Failing to understand and failing to listen are rather different things.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> Truthfully, not all the hitches that were nagging at me have been answered yet.<br/>
We'll have to see what he can tell us about them…<br/>
…Though it appears he's in no condition to do so at the moment.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> True… Dealing with him right now might not solve all the things that are bothering us…<br/>
Dammit…<br/>
But you better remember this… I'll do everything I can to stop him from repeating what he's done.<br/>
Anytime, anywhere… anything.<br/>
<br/>
<i>If Namatame ever did get away, if he ever did try to throw someone else into the TV world, I can tell you this much: Yosuke wouldn't get a chance to do anything. Even if we're misunderstanding things, what he did was still horrible beyond words.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00168.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Geez… How the hell can you stay so calm, man?<br/>
Then again, that's why you're our leader…<br/>
……<br/>
Alright. Let's go ahead and think this through as much as we need.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> If we leave any unanswered questions behind, we'll just be lying to ourselves…<br/>
Yeah, that ain't gonna cut it… Alright, I'm convinced.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> *sigh * Thank you…<br/>
I'll think as hard as I can, and try to help!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> We all know how you feel, Yosuke!<br/>
C'mon, we've accomplished this much together, haven't we?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> Right… Together.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah…<br/>
Yeah, you're right.<br/>
Sorry… and thanks.<br/>
&gt; The case has taken a sharp turn and the Investigation Team is now one step closer to the truth…<br/>
&gt; It seems that you will go on with your friends to solve another mystery…<br/>
<br/>
<i>One door closes…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00185.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00186.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>But another one always opens…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00187.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Adachi.png"/> Hey… you guys!? What're you doing!? You can't be in here!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> Oh crap!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> W-We were keeping an eye on the suspect.<br/>
The police officers outside seemed to have their hands full helping Dojima-san.<br/>
If Namatame were to escape, it would be a disaster for the police's reputation… and their trust in you, Adachi-san.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Adachi.png"/> O-Oh… I see.<br/>
We'll tighten security from now on, and I'll arrange for him to be transported out as soon as possible.<br/>
So… if you guys can keep quiet about being in here, I'd really appreciate it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> How is he, Doctor? He seemed to be extremely agitated a moment ago.<br/>
<b>Doctor:</b> He seems fine for now, but he really needs his rest.<br/>
Outside, everyone. Doctor's orders.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Adachi.png"/> U-Understood.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> We should go too… Let's get back to Nanako-chan's room.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We stopped out in the hall to talk about the case.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>VIDEO- "Life and Death"</b><br/>
<a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/SAFeinne/videos/1026/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00202.jpg"/><br/>
The Power of Persona Compels You To Watch This</a><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> To tell the truth, there's something that's bothering me too…<br/>
Why did he start killing people in the first place?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> Well he said himself, it was to "save" them, right?<br/>
So he killed his lover in order to save her, and kept going?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> The police speculated the first murder was related to the affair, so they called in Namatame for questioning…<br/>
But everything in his testimony and his bearing… No matter what they looked at, they found nothing suspicious.<br/>
If he truly is twisted enough to believe that murder is a means of saving people, I think that would have shone through…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Maybe he faked it real well.<br/>
Or maybe he started out with a normal motive, and got a taste for killing after the first time.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> No… If that were the case, his motive for killing that announcer would be even more inexplicable.<br/>
Namatame and his wife were separated at the time.<br/>
Both Misuzu Hiiragi and himself testified that she had discarded him.<br/>
Hiiragi also knew about Yamano beforehand, and Namatame was shocked to hear of Yamano's death…<br/>
Their relationship was known, and was not strained to the point of murder… There's simply no motive in the affair angle.<br/>
The police invested a great deal of effort into investigating this point.<br/>
Therefore, we have no convincing motive for Namatame to kill Mayumi Yamano…<br/>
Although… her name was written in Namatame's own diary…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> His reason for killing her…<br/>
<br/>
<i>In the end, it was the events that started all this that we understood the least.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00221.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> Uhhh… I don't really get any of this…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> Argh, this is so confusing!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Adachi.png"/> Hey, we could hear you in there… This is a hospital. Maybe you should quiet down a little…<br/>
<br/>
<i>That was when the nurse ran in.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-P4-00225.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Nurse:</b> Please come with me immediately!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> Huh? Wh-What's going on…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Adachi.png"/> What are you waiting for? Hurry, go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Elsewhere…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-P4-00230.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Teddie.png"/> Is this… Teddie's world?<br/>
This doesn't quite feel like it, though…<br/>
I remember being at the hospital…<br/>
That's right… Nana-chan…<br/>
I…<br/>
I couldn't do anything…<br/>
Why do I even exist…?<br/>
I couldn't keep my promise…<br/>
I lost my reason to be there…<br/>
Th-That's it…<br/>
I remember now…<br/>
So… it was true…<br/>
Guys…<br/>
Sensei…<br/>
What should I do…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>All I can say is that miracles do happen, sometimes.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-P4-00246.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Doctor:</b> Nanako-chan came around!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> Huh…? Wh-What did you just say!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> Nanako-chan's… alive!?<br/>
Yosuke; A-Are you serious!?<br/>
<b>Doctor:</b> It's very rare to be resuscitated after one's heart and lungs fail, but it does happen.<br/>
But until I know why she collapsed in the first place, I can't say for sure how well she'll recover from here on…<br/>
Still, Nanako-chan's a fighter, and she's trying desperately to stay alive.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> S-So this isn't a joke…?<br/>
You're actually telling the truth…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> Nanako-chan…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> Oh my God… I… I…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> Haha… This is amazing…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> Miracles do happen… I'm so glad…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> I-I didn't know what I was gonna do… *sniff * *sob *<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> *sob *<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> C'mon… Stop crying, you two… *sob *<br/>
<b>Doctor:</b> You all should go home for the night.<br/>
I'll speak with Dojima-san tomorrow about Nanako-chan's treatment.<br/>
It's rather chilly outside… If it starts snowing, be careful not to catch a cold.<br/>
<br/>
<i>That was when we noticed we were a man short. We all got so damn heated over Namatame we forgot one of our own.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-P4-00267.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> I noticed he didn't come with us when we went to Namatame's room.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> *sniff * You're right… That's weird.<br/>
I figured he wouldn't move from Nanako-chan's side…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> Teddie… Where did you go…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Oh yeah, he has a cell with him… Wait, I shouldn't use mine inside the hospital.<br/>
I'll try calling him up once we're outside.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Elsewhere…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-P4-00274.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Namatame.png"/> Why…?<br/>
Mayumi… and that girl, too…<br/>
I couldn't save them…<br/>
<b>Policeman:</b> Mm…? What's the matter, feeling guilty all of a sudden? Sheesh…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We searched everywhere, but Teddie was nowhere to be found.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-P4-00279.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> We took a quick look around the hospital, but there's no sign of him. I wonder where he went…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> Oh… It's snow…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> Hey, you're right… Wow, it's been a while since I last saw real snow.<br/>
It doesn't look that pretty, though, because of this fog…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> I guess this makes it the first snow of the year.<br/>
Brrr, it's freezing! Let's go home.<br/>
Hey Yosuke, if you find Teddie, don't forget to contact us, alright?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> I know, I know… Let's meet up at the special headquarters tomorrow.<br/>
Man, that Ted… I hope he just went back home by himself.<br/>
He's probably fine, but I'll hurry home, just in case.<br/>
Well… see ya tomorrow!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Teddie better be okay, because it'd make Nanako sad if her Teddie was gone, dammit. I decided to try calling him as well, and realized I'd had my phone off the whole time.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-P4-00291.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; For now, you have no way of knowing…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You remember that your cell phone has been off this entire time since you were at the hospital.<br/>
&gt; There's something new in your inbox.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Kou.png"/> Hey, it's Kou. I heard what happened to your little cousin.<br/>
Is there anything I can do to help? Let me know!<br/>
You know I'm there for you, oaky? We're best friends, dude! …Right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Daisuke.png"/> Daisuke here.<br/>
I just heard about Nanako-chan. How's she doing?<br/>
If there's anything I can do to help you guyz please tell me ASAP!<br/>
You've got the guts, man!! You gotta be brave, man!!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Yumi.png"/> It's Yumi. Where are you right now?<br/>
If you want to talk about your cousin, please don't think twice about calling me.<br/>
I'll be waiting for you. Call me back!<br/>
&gt; …You checked all your messages.<br/>
&gt; …They're from your friends in town.<br/>
&gt; You remember that you have friends who are there to help encourage each other…<br/>
&gt; The case is still mired in an impenetrable fog, but you must continue forth toward the truth…<br/>
&gt; You should go home before you catch a cold…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Everyone… There's just no way we're going to give up now.</i>
