<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Whoa, something's here!<br/>
A-A fox!? When did it...?<br/>
&gt; The mysterious fox you encountered at the shrine is sitting next to you.<br/>
&gt; Could it have followed you without you noticing...?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Whoa, where did this guy come from!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Dude, it looks scary too!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Oh... this apron... I think I've seen it at the shrine before...<br/>
&gt; You told everyone about your encounter with the mysterious fox.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Huh...? Cure us with leaves...?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Huh...? Cooperate with us...?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Are you serious...? So it wants money in exchange for fixing us up...?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Fox.png"/> *yip*<br/>
&gt; The fox gave out a cry, as if in affirmation.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> What's with this guy...?<br/>
It acts like it understands what we're talking about...<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm pretty sure it does, though I've not decided how to feel about that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> It yipped again... Maybe it really does understand what we're saying!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> B-But when you think about it, that means the police on duty and whatnot didn't find this fox, right?<br/>
If it followed after us, then it really is something...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Fox.png"/> *yip*<br/>
&gt; The fox gave a confident cry.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Huh...? Y'think it really understands us...? What should we do...?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Well... I'd feel bad if we trapped it. It doesn't look like it'll do us any harm.<br/>
...What do you think, Souji-kun?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Those leaves were pretty damn effective, so as far as I'm concerned the fox is on the team.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> ...Yeah. And about what Souji-kun said happened at the shrine...<br/>
Don't you think this "curing" would be a big help for us?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Huh!? Are you suggesting we take it into that other world...?<br/>
......<br/>
Mmm... I guess that might work. It doesn't seem like it's going to leave that easily, either...<br/>
And I definitely don't want it being all sulky and getting up to mischief in the store...<br/>
&gt; The fox looks satisfied.<br/>
&gt; You decided to let the fox do whatever it wants...<br/>
&gt; You should try taking it to the other world...<br/>
<br/>
<b>Gameplay notes:</b><br/>
So from now on the fox will join us in the lobby of the TV world. If we pay him, he'll restore our lost SP. Our Hermit rank<br/>
determines the base cost per SP restored. On any given day, though, the fox will either be happy, normal, or angry. This will<br/>
also impact the price of restoring SP. Once we get Hermit up a bit, we can easily do dungeons in a single day.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I told Teddie what Kanji's friend or whatever had told me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie.png"/> Hmmhmm, a complex...<br/>
......<br/>
Th-That's it!? That's all I have to go on? You're working me to the stuffing...<br/>
Oh well... Then I'll open my nose up real wide and sniff real hard!<br/>
Hrmmmm...<br/>
Oh, I think I found something! It feels like our target! Is this it!?<br/>
Follow me!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We followed Teddie to my new least favorite place in the whole wide world.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Is it just me... or does the fog here seem kinda different?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> My glasses are fogging up.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Man, it's hot in here. This place is like a--<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-ShadowKanji.png"/> C'mere, pussycat...<br/>
Oh... Such well-defined pecs...<br/>
There's no need to be scared...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Uhhhh...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-ShadowKanji.png"/> Now, just relax...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> W-Wait a sec! I-I don't wanna go!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Is Kanji-kun really here, Teddie?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie.png"/> The nose knows!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> We're... really going in here...? Urgh, I can already feel the sweat rolling down my back...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> That's becasue it's so hot...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Just as with Yukiko's castle, we heard unsettling things as we pushed forward. And just as before, Shadows swarmed everywhere.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie.png"/> So why do I feel a chill down my fuzzy spine?<br/>
I think I caught a cold... My nose is totally useless too.<br/>
Kanji-kun, where are you!? Answer us!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Also, Teddie mercifully didn't get what was going on with this place.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie.png"/> ......<br/>
Oh yeah, Sensei! Can I ask you something?<br/>
Why is it so steamy here? Does it have something to do with Kanji-kun?<br/>
I don't really get it... Do you know what it is, Sensei?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Souji.png"/> I think I get the hints...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie.png"/> Ah, that's my Sensei! Is there anything you don't know!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't know how my life got to the point where I'm fighing crazy monsters in a sauna.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00082.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie.png"/> I just got goosebumps!<br/>
Something is on this floor! Be careful...!<br/>
<br/>
<i>As always Teddie was right.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Kanji!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-ShadowKanji.png"/> Oooooh, my my! Thank you for your undivided attention!<br/>
At last, I've penetrated the facility!<br/>
These images are coming to you live from inside this steamy paradise!<br/>
But I've yet to have any charming encounters. Could this hot fog be the cause?<br/>
It's like steam rising from sweat! Mmmm, my body's tingling with excitement!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh I don't know if I've said this yet but WHAT THE FUCK.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00094.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Crap... This is wrong in so many ways...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Yeah... I remember it being kinda like this on Yukiko's show, too...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> N-No... It wasn't like this...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Those voices again...<br/>
Wait, are they louder this time?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> These voices...<br/>
I was wondering whose they could be, since it's only the victim in here... Is it the people watching outside?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> You mean everybody who's watching the Midnight Channel? They're reacting to the "show"?<br/>
Yikes... If people are watching Kanji-kun now, he's gonna be a legend in a way he never intended...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Well, it's really his Shadow, not him. But normal people won't know that...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie.png"/> The Shadows are getting really restless!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-ShadowKanji.png"/> That elusive thing I truly yearn for... Will I finally find it here? Teehee!<br/>
Well then, onward and deeper to reach further realms of romance!<br/>
Let's get going, dammit!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Kanji-kun!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie.png"/> That was his other self... It's trying to reveal his hidden feelings.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I need to have words with Teddie on this pun thing. It's getting out of hand.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00111.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> "Bear"...naked...?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Oh man... here it comes...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Uh... Was I supposed to laugh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>We pushed a bit farther after that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00116.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-ShadowKanji.png"/> A man can't back down at a time like this!<br/>
Just watch, and I'll show you how manly Kanji Tatsumi can be!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We were getting a bit tired, though, so we headed back to the lobby. Before we left, though, I remembered something...</i><br/>

<b>VIDEO- "Contrarian King"</b><br/>

<br/>
<b>Boss Battle: Contrarian King</b><br/>
Okay so this guy is much harder than you'd expect him to be. He's only got two real moves, Hysterical Slap and Rampage.<br/>
Hysterical Slap does a decent amount of damage to one target, and Rampage does massive damage to everyone. You are very likely to be<br/>
killed by Rampage if you're not around level 20 or so. He pulls a damn dirty trick at the start by casting Red Wall, which makes you<br/>
think he'll be weak to Fire. He actually Drains Fire, though. Having resistance to Physical helps, as does having a decent amount of<br/>
group healing and just in general being high enough level not to get gibbed by Rampage. The reward is a Courage boost and an awesome<br/>
weapon for Yukiko that gives her +50 SP so it's very worth doing this fight once you're high enough.<br/>
<br/>
<i>That thing would have been a real bastard if we'd not just come from some serious training, I'm glad we didn't tackle it earlier. Still, we were exhausted and had to head back.<br/>
The fog won't come for a while yet, so we still have plenty of time...</i>
