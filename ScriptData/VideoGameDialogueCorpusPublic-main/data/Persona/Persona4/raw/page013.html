			<b>4/26/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>Today had some, um, highs and lows. I guess I should really start with a high, last night. They'd gone out to the grocery earlier, so I decided to unleash my culinary arts.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&gt; You have the ingredients to make pork ginger.<br/>
&gt; You decided to make pork ginger.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; How should you prepare the pork meat?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Clearly there was only one thing to do here.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You scored the meat and rubbed it with the marinating sauce.<br/>
&gt; Obtained Aromatic Pork Ginger. <br/>
&gt; …In addition, you made Bait x 3 from the leftovers.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm basically the Iron Chef Inaba. Anyway, Yosuke's not the only one who has problems in class.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mrs. Nakayama:</b> Supposedly, it knows how to search the change dispenser of the vending machines. How amazing is that?<br/>
Even animals can learn the value of money… I guess I'll have to keep my wallet more secure from now on.<br/>
Students, at your age you might not understand, but money is very important! You can't do anything without it!<br/>
And you know, smarts don't guarantee wealth. …Anyway, I guess I should do what they pay me for and lecture you.<br/>
Let's see, we left off talking about the properties of whole numbers…<br/>
Oh, here's an interesting one. A natural number that's half the sum of its positive divisors is called…?<br/>
Come on, look at the third page of the handout. What's the answer, class?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Huh? I can't find my handout…<br/>
It's half a sum of its divisors…? I'm totally lost… Do you know what the answer is, Souji-kun?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Fortunately I hadn't lost my handout, because man was this obscure.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You gave her the answer you think is correct.<br/>
<b>Mrs. Nakayama:</b> Right, a perfect number. Satonaka-san, please come pick up an extra handout if you don't have one.<br/>
Now, about these perfect numbers… The first one is six, then 28… Then we jump to 496, and then the next one is 8,128.<br/>
For your information, no perfect number that is also odd has been found yet. That's why these numbers are so special.<br/>
Anyway, let's move on. This is the Mersenne Prime. It's really quite…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Ooops, I guess she saw me…<br/>
But… thanks, Souji-kun!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I figured out when I got in that there was way too much pork for just me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You've brought your lunch today. Do you wish to eat lunch with someone?<br/>
&gt; Who would you like to invite for lunch?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I figured Chie would appreciate it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You ate lunch with Chie.<br/>
&gt; You ate Aromatic Pork Ginger together.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> It's delicious! I've never eaten anything that tastes this good before!<br/>
I want more, but… I don't wanna finish it all!<br/>
What a dilemma…!<br/>
Umm… Did you make this for me?<br/>
Th-Thank you…<br/>
&gt; It was Chie's favorite!<br/>
<br/>
<i>In the afternoon I hit up soccer practice, best to keep in shape if we ever do have to go back in the TV. Anyway most of the team are still assholes.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Daisuke.png"/> Again!?<br/>
Before we do any cleaning, though, let's work on your dribbling!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kou.png"/> You guys haven't even started?<br/>
Oh well…<br/>
Want me to toss balls at you or something?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Daisuke.png"/> This isn't tennis, dude. Go stand over there and play some defense.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kou.png"/> Defense? No problem! You should see me on a basketball court.<br/>
&gt; Daisuke and Kou are helping you practice…<br/>
&gt; You sense their consideration towards you…<br/>
<br/>
<i>These social link things are like rolling off a log so far.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> Uh, um, hey, D-Daisuke-kun!<br/>
Practice is over, right? D-Do you wanna, um…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Daisuke.png"/> Does it look like I'm done practicing? Seeya.<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> Huh? Oh, uh… Would you mind if I waited for you? Am I in the way?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Daisuke.png"/> Yes… you are. We need to concentrate.<br/>
C'mon, Souji, let's get started.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kou.png"/> H-Hey, don't mind him. He's got soccer on the brain, y'know?<br/>
What's his problem…?<br/>
Well? Are we gonna get started?<br/>
&gt; The three of you had an intense practice…<br/>
&gt; Afterward, you cleaned up and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm not sure what Daisuke's deal is. Maybe I should ask Kou sometime, they seem tight. Anyway, today was going great until I got home and checked out the fridge.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; …There's white miso.<br/>
&gt; …?<br/>
&gt; You think that this used to be red miso, though…<br/>
&gt; There is a package of red miso, but it is far past its expiration date.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; Eat it…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think I'm stupid.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; ………<br/>
&gt; Your tongue hurts…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; Your eyes water from the odor…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; Your throat is burning…<br/>
&gt; Your Courage has greatly increased.<br/>
&gt; However…<br/>
&gt; You don't feel well…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You decided to go to bed early today…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Never. Again. Ughh…</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>4/27/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>It's started raining, and the forecast says it's going to continue tomorrow. It's a good thing we got Yukiko out when we did. It was so miserable out that nobody really wanted to do anything, so I headed down to the shopping district. That gas station attendant from the day I moved here was on shift. Seems like the rumors about the Midnight Channel are spreading.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00104.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Attendant:</b> When it rains in the middle of the night, look into a television that's turned off…<br/>
And wonder of wonders, you'll see your soulmate in the screen.<br/>
I don't know if it's true or not, but there seem to be a lot of people who believe it.<br/>
Maybe I should try it myself.<br/>
<br/>
<i>When I'd been to Aiya with Daisuke and Kou, I noticed they had some rainy day special. I decided to check it out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00115.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Aiya seems to be having some kind of promotion today.<br/>
&gt; A sign reads, "Rainy day challenge, 3,000 yen Mega Beef Bowl! If you finish this quintuple-sized bowl, it's free!"<br/>
&gt; You think this dish will raise several "characteristics."<br/>
<br/>
<i>So anyway Aiya is the best place in Inaba.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00121.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You accepted the Rainy Day Special Mega Beef Bowl Challenge!<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You still can't see the rice…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You begin to suspect that your bowl is a portal to the Meat Dimension.<br/>
&gt; The amount of meat contained within this bowl is truly staggering.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; In order to finish this bowl, you must have Understanding of your limits, Knowledge to control your pace…<br/>
&gt; Courage to face this unrelenting tide of beef, and the Diligence to persevere against this colossal challenge.<br/>
&gt; All these traits are necessary to master the Rainy Day Special Mega Beef Bowl Challenge!<br/>
&gt; You are unable to finish your meal in your current state.<br/>
&gt; …You tried your best to finish the Rainy Day Special Mega Beef Bowl Challenge, and your personality has grown tremendously.<br/>
<b>Aiya Owner:</b> Aiyaaaa! Too bad, Mister!<br/>
That'll be 3,000 yen.<br/>
Come back soon! Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
<i>One day, I will finish you, Beef Bowl Challenge!</i><br/>

<i>Chie had some great news this morning.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00138.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Hey hey! Yukiko told me that she'll be able to come to school again in two days!<br/>
Oh man, I'm glad. I'm so happy!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> C'mon, you know it's because all three of us did our best.<br/>
……<br/>
…Actually, more like the three of us, and one animal-thingy…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yumi stopped me at lunch and asked if I'd go to drama practice this afternoon. I'd been thinking of doing so, so I agreed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00158.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Drama Club President:</b> Just doing fundamentals all the time gets boring, so let's try doing some real performing!<br/>
We'll hold an audition. Everyone, remember the line I'm about to say.<br/>
After the audition, well decide our roles and finish it off with a five-minute skit.<br/>
Got it? Now pay attention…<br/>
"What crazes me is not the light of the moon, nor the golden sea, but merely the trickle of your tears."<br/>
You all got that? Well, I'm not going to repeat it!<br/>
Alright, we'll start with Souji. Come on up here, in front of everybody. Show some emotion!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Yumi.png"/> Don't worry, believe in yourself!<br/>
&gt; The line began…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Of course I remembered the line.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00171.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Then it went…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00173.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You're getting into it!<br/>
&gt; You recited the entire line, with lots of emotion.<br/>
<b>Drama Club President:</b> Okay, next person!<br/>
Maaya, you wanna try?<br/>
We already know that you're going to be my main character!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Yumi.png"/> I'll try. I think I got it.<br/>
"What crazes me…"<br/>
&gt; Yumi appears to be a completely different person as she recites.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Yumi.png"/> "…is not the light of he moon, nor the golden sea!"<br/>
……<br/>
"But merely… the trickle of your tears…"<br/>
&gt; Yumi's own eyes are full of tears.<br/>
&gt; She has become the character…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yumi is scary good.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00187.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Jealous Student:</b> She's always so good… It's scary…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Yumi.png"/> If anyone thinks they can do a better job than me, please come on up.<br/>
<b>Drama Club President:</b> Yumi, don't say it like that…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Yumi.png"/> If only standing around flirting made you a better actor, huh…?<br/>
<b>Drama Club Vice President:</b> H-Hey, come on! We all remember the line, so we might as well do it, right?<br/>
I think watching others act is a good experience, too. Don't you, Yumi?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Yumi.png"/> …You're right. Go ahead.<br/>
&gt; Everyone recited the line, but…<br/>
&gt; Yumi was the best, hands down.<br/>
<b>Drama Club President:</b> Okay, we've unanimously decided that Yumi will be the protagonist…<br/>
And she'll be opposite… Souji!<br/>
I mean, it's either you or me, and what I'd really rather do is direct.<br/>
&gt; You must play Yumi's husband in a short skit…<br/>
<br/>
<i>So we split off to practice a bit before the main event, as it were.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00201.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Yumi.png"/> Don't be so tense. This is just practice.<br/>
…But I do want us to take it seriously, so give it a shot, okay?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm sure not going to give anything less than 100%.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00204.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Yumi.png"/> Well, I'll lead you through it!<br/>
&gt; Yumi seems excited.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Yumi.png"/> Acting is fun, isn't it?<br/>
When you're acting, it's like you get to take on the life of another person.<br/>
Not just yourself. Not some Yumi Ozawa… But another life to live…<br/>
I don't need lights. I don't need costumes. All I need is a role to play.<br/>
All I need… is to not be me…<br/>
…Oh, sorry! If I keep talking, you'll end up forgetting your own lines, huh?<br/>
…Let's give it a whirl, "darling!"<br/>
&gt; With Yumi's encouragement, you decided to accept the role of her husband.<br/>
&gt; You feel that your relationship with Yumi has deepened a little…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It seems Yumi has some problems she's trying to run away from by acting, though I'm not sure what those might be.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00217.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Yumi.png"/> Alright! Want to ad-lib a kiss?<br/>
&gt; With Yumi's help, you were able to complete the skit to the applause of the entire drama club.<br/>
&gt; Yumi seems very happy. You went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's still raining, and it's supposed to continue all day tomorrow. This is just miserable.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>4/29/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Seriously this rain. Nobody wants to do anything. At least it's going to stop tonight.</i><br/>

<b>Weather Announcer:</b> A thick fog is expected to set in tonight and remain until tomorrow morning, with heaviest concentration in the Inaba area.<br/>
Anyone planning to go out tonight should take care. Now for our hourly weather breakdown…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Dojima.png"/> More fog, huh…? There's been a lot of that lately. Hopefully it's not a sign of more trouble…<br/>
Ah-ah-ah. What did I say about changing the channel without asking?<br/>
<b>Commercial:</b> Have a great day even during Golden Week at your local Junes!<br/>

<i>A vacation away from crazy fog murder town is pretty attractive.</i><br/>

&gt; No one is appearing on the Midnight Channel.<br/>
