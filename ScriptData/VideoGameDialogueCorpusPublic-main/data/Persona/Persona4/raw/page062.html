<i>God, my life sucks some days.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Mr. Kondo:</b> Did you all take good care of your elders? I sure did!<br/>
My grandmother is over 90, but she still gets out and sweats by playing gateball!<br/>
I just know she's gonna live over 100 years! Heck, she's almost there! I wish her all the best to reach 100!<br/>
…Oh, Souji! You're a city boy, you might know this!<br/>
What do you call people between the age of 100 and 110?<br/>
<br/>
<i>This wasn't really that tricky.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Kondo:</b> Wow, I'm amazed by that brain of yours, Souji. Are you close to your grandparents?<br/>
"Centi" is a prefix for 100, right? So it makes sense for a centenarian to be between the ages of 100 and 110.<br/>
I learned that from Mr. Hosoi. Interesting, huh?<br/>
Say, why don't we practice gateball so you'll be able to play it with your elders!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I took a quick walk down by the river and met a guy who had to be the dude who made that wish at the shrine.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Man:</b> …Oh, d-did you hear that?<br/>
Ahahaha, well… I-It's okay, right!?<br/>
People have the right to think of their beloved!<br/>
*sigh * I'm getting married…<br/>
&gt; The man seems melancholic about his wedding for some reason.<br/>
<b>Man:</b> Dammit… Everything would be great if it wasn't for him…<br/>
Who am I talking about? That horrendous furball…<br/>
The c…<br/>
Argh! I'm scared! I can't even say it! Those fanged demons are terrifying!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I can't say I'm get a guy who's afraid of cats after fighting Shadows for my life.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Man:</b> Arrrgh! D-Don't say the "c-word"!<br/>
&gt; The man is actually physically trembling at the thought of cats…<br/>
&gt; Perhaps he's the one who wrote the ema request the fox showed you.<br/>
&gt; He wants to overcome his fear of cats…<br/>
<b>Ailurophobe:</b> The meowing, and the whiskers, and the evil little claws! It's all just so scary…<br/>
Of all the pets, Miyoko-san wants to have a c-c-cat… She said we can't get married if I won't let her have one.<br/>
Arrrgh! Why must you put me through this horrible test, Miyoko-san!?<br/>
&gt; You try and figure out a way to force him to overcome his fear.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I tried to explain why cats were great, but he wasn't buying it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Ailurophobe:</b> S-Stop it! Stop that right now!<br/>
What do you want? Money!? I'll give you money, just get away from meeeeee!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I remembered that a stray cat lives near our house, and a plan began to form in my mind. I'll need a bit of prep work for it, though. Anyway, I went back to school. Yumi wanted to talk to me, so we went to drama for a bit.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yumi.png"/> I'm thinking about finding answers to the questions I had before.<br/>
To "bear good fruit…" What can I do? What must I do?<br/>
I hated him… I despised him… But he was my one and only Dad…<br/>
He and Mom are the ones who gave me life…<br/>
Then… What can I do for the people who gave me this life? For the people who have supported me?<br/>
I've been thinking about it all this time…<br/>
I think I was using acting as a way to hide from the world.<br/>
To me, the plays were where I could live a different life.<br/>
Where I wouldn't have to look at my own sadness…<br/>
I don't know what I can do, but I'm going to find out.<br/>
I'm not going to run from my own life anymore. After all, I'm the only person who can live it.<br/>
So… As of today, I'm quitting the drama club.<br/>
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about this sooner. But I know if I had, I would be depending on you.<br/>
If you told me it's okay to quit… I'd stop right there, and not make any decisions on my own.<br/>
And sooner or later… I'd be blaming you for it, even if you only had my best interests at heart.<br/>
That's why I had to decide myself…<br/>
I'm sorry. And… thank you.<br/>
Um… Can you take this?<br/>
<br/>
<i>She handed me her copy of our script. We never got to perform it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yumi.png"/> Even if it was my escape from the world, I put my heart into my work.<br/>
If you can remember what I was like back then, I can carry on even further.<br/>
Souji-kun… Thank you… For listening to me and supporting me…<br/>
You gave me the opportunity… to start walking.<br/>
&gt; You feel Yumi's deep gratitude…<br/>
&gt; You feel a strong bond forming between Yumi and yourself…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It well may be that we will never meet again in this lifetime.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Still, whichever way this story ends.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00081.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>She's made mine brighter by being my friend.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yumi.png"/> Y-Y'know…<br/>
I… I love you…<br/>
So, uh…<br/>
I'll turn around, so if you're going to reject me, just leave the room. That way, I won't have to see you go…<br/>
<br/>
<i>So anyway I hate my life.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00093.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yumi.png"/> …Goodbye.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Not even talking to Nanako could really make me feel better, and normally that does it. But seriously, what if I died in the TV world? How would that be fair to someone who doesn't even know about it? It's for the best like this. I keep telling myself.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>I am a veritable hub of relationship problems, though at least they're not mine for once. Ai wanted to ask me about something after school.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00104.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Ai yanked your arm all the way up here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ai.png"/> H-Hey. Umm…<br/>
Th-Thank you for that, last time…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Souji.png"/> You're welcome.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ai.png"/> I was… you know, happy.<br/>
&gt; Ai looks embarrassed…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ai.png"/> I-I'm…<br/>
I'm in a weird mood…<br/>
Every time I think about what happened, I can feel my heart beat faster, and I hardly sleep at night…<br/>
Wh-What should I do…?<br/>
I…<br/>
I think…<br/>
What should I do? I think I'm… in love.<br/>
It's funny, isn't it? Like… why now?<br/>
I just keep thinking back on that day…<br/>
And about Daisuke-kun…<br/>
D-Do you know if he has a girlfriend?<br/>
Do you think maybe I'm his type? O-Or do you think he hates… people like me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I am probably not the best person to ask about this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00123.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ai.png"/> Y-You're right!<br/>
&gt; Ai nods seriously…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ai.png"/> I-I'm not used to things like this…<br/>
You're the only one I can turn to…<br/>
&gt; Ai is looking at you with pleading eyes…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Ai deepen as she reveals a side of herself you've never seen before…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm not sure what Ai and Daisuke have in common but I guess that's why I'm supposed to ask him.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00130.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ai.png"/> C'mon, please… You'll help me, right?<br/>
All I need you to do is… ask him what's his type. That's it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Souji.png"/> No problem.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ai.png"/> Thank goodness…<br/>
Um, y-you don't have to do it today or anything, but… p-please…<br/>
&gt; You parted with Ai in silence and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh, and Nanako and Dojima seem to be talking more.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00139.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> I gave it back to Dad.<br/>
He looked happy and smiled at me.<br/>
Big bro… I love my Dad.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Souji.png"/> He loves you, too.<br/>
&gt; Nanako is smiling cheerfully…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> Dad didn't forget about how we used to pick flowers at the Samegawa River.<br/>
He smiled at me and said, "You remember, too?"<br/>
Dad loves Mom.<br/>
…I feel sorry for him, losing someone he loves.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Souji.png"/> He still has you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> Yeah! I won't go anywhere!<br/>
&gt; Nanako smiles vigorously…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> I'm glad to be Dad's daughter!<br/>
&gt; Nanako is smiling so happily…<br/>
&gt; Through that smile, you feel your relationship has grown even deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I knew Dojima hadn't forgotten.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00160.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> …It's your turn to talk!<br/>
&gt; It's just about Nanako's bedtime…<br/>
&gt; What will you do…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided to let her stay up a while.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00166.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Nanako.png"/> Yay!<br/>
Then, uh, I know! Let's play cards!<br/>
&gt; Nanako looks really happy.<br/>
&gt; You decide to play some cards with her.<br/>
&gt; It's getting late, so you put Nanako to bed and went to your own room.<br/>
<br/>
<b>9/22/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Kanji and I went up to the hill that overlooks town after school.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00172.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Kanji took you here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kanji.png"/> I've always liked this place.<br/>
Being able to see my house and school and everything from up here… It makes me feel small.<br/>
……<br/>
Uhh… When you met Ma at the hospital… She say anything about me?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Souji.png"/> Plenty.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kanji.png"/> That's what I thought…<br/>
Well, you already know everything about me. I got nothin' to hide.<br/>
&gt; Kanji has an embarrassed smile on his face.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kanji.png"/> Wish I could quit being afraid of hospitals.<br/>
I gotta get stronger…<br/>
Huh?<br/>
That kid… He was with Ma at the hospital…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sure enough the kid his mom took to the hospital was around.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00186.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Quiet-Looking Boy:</b> Uh… Ummm…<br/>
Nothing…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kanji.png"/> Then how come you look like you're gonna cry?<br/>
<b>Quiet-Looking Boy:</b> I… lost a doll…<br/>
I lost the knit rabbit doll that Sana-chan let me borrow…<br/>
Taka-kun said it was girly and stomped on it…<br/>
It got all dirty… And he said, "If you're a man, then throw it away…"<br/>
I… threw the doll in the river… And it got washed away…<br/>
Waaaaaaaaaaaah!!<br/>
*hic * What should I do!? I hafta give it back to Sana-chan…<br/>
She liked that bunny… And I… I…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kanji.png"/> ……<br/>
So why are you here? You ran away?<br/>
<b>Quiet-Looking Boy:</b> *sniff * *hic *<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kanji.png"/> …Ya dumb kid!<br/>
<b>Quiet-Looking Boy:</b> Waaaaaaaaaah!!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kanji.png"/> C'mon! Don't just stand there!!<br/>
Oh, uhh… I'm gonna go now.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I had sort of guessed what Kanji was going to do and offered to help.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00205.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kanji.png"/> Huh? Really!?<br/>
&gt; Kanji's eyes are wide open…<br/>
<br/>
<i>At the same time, unlike Kanji I was not so gung ho to jump back into the Samegawa.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00208.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Kanji is looking in the river…<br/>
<b>Quiet-Looking Boy:</b> I-I'll help…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kanji.png"/> You shut up. Stay where you are so you don't get in the way!<br/>
Senpai, make sure he doesn't come in after me!<br/>
Whoa, this is cold.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; Despite his efforts, Kanji was unable to find a bunny doll…<br/>
<b>Quiet-Looking Boy:</b> I-I'm sorry…<br/>
I'm going to apologize to Sana-chan. Even if she's mad, I'll say I'm sorry…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kanji.png"/> Uh, yeah, well, if you do find the rabbit, make sure you give it to her…<br/>
Yo, hold up.<br/>
What kind of rabbit was it? Spill it.<br/>
Just tell me!<br/>
Alright, I got it.<br/>
You apologize to this "Sana-chan." You're the one who "threw it away."<br/>
It might not be the same, but I'll get you a new one…<br/>
So let it go with that.<br/>
<b>Quiet-Looking Boy:</b> M-Mister…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kanji.png"/> Who you callin' mister!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>The kid ran off to give the bad news to his friend.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00228.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kanji.png"/> …Do I really look that old? Maybe it's the eyebrows…<br/>
……<br/>
Oh… Anyways, sorry 'bout dragging you into this…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Souji.png"/> You're giving him a new one?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kanji.png"/> …So you heard me, huh?<br/>
&gt; Kanji seems really embarrassed…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kanji.png"/> It was like I understood how he felt.<br/>
Wanting to be accepted, afraid of being left out, doing stuff that you shouldn't…<br/>
Then taking the one person you shouldn't make cry and making 'em bawl…<br/>
So… Y'know, I thought maybe I could help him.<br/>
Was I going too easy on him?<br/>
&gt; Kanji has an embarrassed smile on his face…<br/>
&gt; You feel you understand Kanji a bit more…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm not sure where he's gonna get the rabbit though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00242.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kanji.png"/> Ah… hmmm?<br/>
Guh, I feel like sneezing but it won't come out. This sucks…<br/>
It looks like I'm catching a cold… I better head home.<br/>
&gt; You parted with Kanji and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I also headed down to the hospital to work a bit, Sayoko seems to be more serious than before but maybe it's just me.</i>
