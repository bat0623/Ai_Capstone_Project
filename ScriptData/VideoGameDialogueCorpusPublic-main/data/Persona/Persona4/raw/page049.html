<i>As expected, Yosuke called me up this morning.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Sorry for dropping this on you all of a sudden, but I need a big favor. Can you work at Junes from today 'til Friday?<br/>
We're short on staff! I'll pay you more than we usually pay our workers!<br/>
I'll buy you lunch everyday at work too, I promise! Please, I'm begging you!<br/>
&gt; Yosuke seems desperate…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I couldn't leave him hanging like that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I'll be waiting for you at Junes, so I'll see ya soon!<br/>
&gt; Yosuke hung up.<br/>
&gt; You decided to work at Junes until Friday.<br/>
<br/>
<i>The food court was crazy packed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Why are there so many people just for the hero show…?<br/>
This is soooo freakin' tiring…<br/>
I'd be a zombie by now if you weren't here, Souji…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Welcome! We've got shaved ice here, with all your favorite flavors!<br/>
Cheer on the heroes while enjoying a tasty snack of frosty shaved ice!<br/>
…Ugh, it's so hot today!<br/>
&gt; Teddie is keeping up a good pace…<br/>
&gt; You helped Yosuke in the food court while the sun blazed down upon you…<br/>
&gt; You became closer to everyone…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think the next few days are going to be nuts.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>8/19/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>So goddamn tired.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Welcome, everyone! Beat the heat and eat some meat!<br/>
Yakikiku! Grilled steak! Pork ginger! Chow down and restore the energy the brutal summer days have taken for you!<br/>
Try our tender, delicious beef!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Man, Teddie is really dedicated, isn't he?<br/>
I'm melting in this short-sleeved shirt, and he's wearing that huge costume. AND he's standing in front of the griddle.<br/>
How does he do it…?<br/>
&gt; You helped Yosuke in the food court while the sun blazed down upon you…<br/>
&gt; You became closer to everyone…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, tomorrow's the Summer Festival, remember?<br/>
Meet us at the shrine tomorrow night, okay?<br/>
&gt; …Today is the last day you had to help Yosuke.<br/>
&gt; You earned 40,000 yen for your work.<br/>
<br/>
<i>God I can't wait until this festival after this week.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>8/20/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Well, the first day of the festival was today, and we all got together.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> Yeah, there ain't that many people here this year. Well, I guess you can't blame people for being scared…<br/>
Haven't seen the reporters around, either. They sure are good at stirring shit up and then disappearing.<br/>
Well, it ain't so bad to have thin crowds. What IS important right now is that we go get some ikayaki!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie2.png"/> Ooh, I wanna get some too! Kanji, what's ikayaki?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Man, they're late… Why were they meeting up at Yukiko's house in the first place?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> They'll show up sooner or-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie2.png"/> Whoa, isn't that them?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Turned out they went there to get dressed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yukiko.png"/> It took us some time to get dressed.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Rise.png"/> You have to wrap towels inside, so they're not as breezy as everyone says.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Nanako.png"/> It's kinda hard to walk…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Souji.png"/> You look cute in it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Nanako.png"/> *giggle *<br/>
&gt; Nanako seems happy.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie2.png"/> Nana-chan, you look so cute! I'm head over heels for you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Nanako.png"/> *giggle * Thank you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Rise.png"/> How do we look, Senpai? Does the sight make your heart skip a beat?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I sometimes forget why Rise was an idol, and then things like this remind me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Rise.png"/> Ooh, that slipped out so naturally. Perhaps… you're used to saying things like that?<br/>
*chuckle * Well, I'm still happy to hear it.<br/>
&gt; Rise seems happy.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Kanji? What're you looking away for?<br/>
Don't tell me you're ashamed to look! What are you, a monk…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> Th-That ain't it!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Rise.png"/> Ahaha! You're so cute, Kanji.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dojima.png"/> Hey… Thanks for looking after her.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Nanako.png"/> They bought me cotton candy!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dojima.png"/> Did they now? Alright then, you wanna go over and do the target prac-I mean game with me?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Nanako.png"/> Uh-huh! Let's go!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dojima.png"/> I'll take care of Nanako from here.<br/>
It's only a few times a year that this town gets charged up like this. You kids should go and have fun.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I also need to remember that Teddie's ideas are always terrible.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie2.png"/> A couple walking together at a festival… Unused to wearing it, the girl's yukata comes loose… Summer has begun.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> What kinda tagline is that…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie2.png"/> We gotta go two-by-two! Raaaawr!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yukiko.png"/> Two-by-two…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie2.png"/> See, I've been thinking. It's the summer, you're wearing yukata, and we're at a festival.<br/>
It's just wrong for guys and girls to walk around in a huge group like this.<br/>
We should couple up while we're here! It's the natural way of things!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> Wh-What the hell are you babblin' about!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Rise.png"/> I'm with Teddie!<br/>
C'mon, Senpai… Why wear yukata in the first place? So we have memories we can remember fondly, right?<br/>
So we should pair off right away!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Rise… What a terrifying girl!<br/>
You got a point, though… Good memories…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yukiko.png"/> I-I'm fine too.<br/>
Oh, what I mean is, um… Count me in.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Alright… Y-You guys decide how we'll split up.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Huh? Seriously? It's up to us?<br/>
A-Alright…<br/>
<br/>
<i>There was a serious issue though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie2.png"/> Three guys? Aren't you missing one?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> What? Me, him, and Kanji makes three.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie2.png"/> Whaaa!? You did that on purpose!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> Uhhh… Should I really do this?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Oh yeah… You can barely look at 'em…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> N-No way! I can look at 'em! It'll be a chinch, just you watch!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Nah… You should bail, Kanji. It'd be best for everyone that way.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> Wha--!? You don't believe me!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie2.png"/> Well, I've made my decision…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> Hey, wait 'til we're done for that!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie2.png"/> I want Chie-chan and Yuki-chan and Rise-chan for my partner.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> That's not a decision! Dude, you're the one who said we gotta pair off in the first place!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> I ain't joking here, Ted! If you try and butt in on this-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie2.png"/> That's right, Kanji! This is serious business! And you're a true man!<br/>
A true man wouldn't be prancing around with other girls at a place like this!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> O-Okay…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> How much more can you butter him up…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie2.png"/> Kanji! This is a test to see if you can uphold your status as a true man!<br/>
<br/>
<i>And that issue is that Teddie is a terrible person. Bear. Whatever the hell he is.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00110.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> Y-Yeah… You're right!<br/>
Thanks, Teddie! You said it.<br/>
Okay, count me out.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Dude, come on! Don't fall for that!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie2.png"/> It's decided! I'm going with all of you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Huh? What's going on?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie2.png"/> Oh, well, there were too many guys, so someone would have been left out…<br/>
I just couldn't let that happen.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> WHAT!? You little--!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Haha, I see.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yukiko.png"/> You're so kind, Teddie…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Rise.png"/> We let them decide and this is what we get? Awww, what a letdown…<br/>
Oh well… Let's go, then.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> …We fail, huh?<br/>
An epic fail…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And the worst part was that we could hear them having fun while we stood around like the goddamn idiots we are.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00127.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Rise.png"/> Why're you buying another idol's photo!? Mine's in there too!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Aaaaargh, what's with this!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> H-Hey, Ted! Hands off my corn!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yukiko.png"/> Teddie! You got ketchup on my yukata!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Seriously though Teddie doesn't get to come to any parties ever again.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ai.png"/> You got time today? I heard there's a festival going on at the shrine.<br/>
…Do you get it? I'm inviting you to come with me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Souji.png"/> Let's go.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ai.png"/> Okay. I'll see you in a bit.<br/>
&gt; She hung up…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed down to the shrine as it got dark.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Mobile stalls are lined up from yesterday…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ai.png"/> This place looks pretty dead. I thought there'd be more to do…<br/>
Oh well. Why don't we start off with… Candied apples!<br/>
Oh wait, before we do that, we should make a wish at the shrine.<br/>
…Why are you making that face? It's common sense.<br/>
So, what are you gonna wish for?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm mostly wishing that all the time I spent having to fight evil monsters doesn't screw me over later in the year at this point.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00149.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ai.png"/> …I see. You're such a go-getter.<br/>
Alright, let's make these wishes.<br/>
&gt; You made your wish from the bottom of your heart…<br/>
&gt; Your Knowledge has significantly increased.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ai.png"/> Now it's time for those apples!<br/>
<b>Candy Apple Man:</b> Hello there! I've got the best candy apples in town!<br/>
Hm? What a beautiful lady you have there. You must be lucky! I'll add a lottery ticket for each time you buy!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ai.png"/> Hm?<br/>
<b>Candy Apple Man:</b> You'll get a chance to draw a lottery at the torii when you guy something from the stands there.<br/>
The prizes range from cheap trinkets to fabulous, magnificent items!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ai.png"/> …Alright, I'll give it a try!<br/>
&gt; Ai seems especially excited for some reason…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ai.png"/> Gimme ten candied apples.<br/>
Can I please get ten orders of okonomiyaki, please?<br/>
Hm, goldfish scooping. Let's see how many we can catch in… 30 tries.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Ai went a little nuts but it does help the community I guess.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00165.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Lottery Worker:</b> Thanks for your support.<br/>
I'll go get the lottery box.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ai.png"/> ..No way I'm wasting my time doing 50 draws… How 'bout you do it for me?<br/>
Make sure you get the grand prize, though!<br/>
<b>Lottery Worker:</b> Close your eyes and draw your prize.<br/>
&gt; …<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; ………<br/>
&gt; You drew 50 tickets…<br/>
<b>Lottery Worker:</b> Congratulations! You've drawn the grand prize!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ai.png"/> Yes! What is it?<br/>
<b>Lottery Worker:</b> The grand prize is… a bale of rice.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ai.png"/> …A bale of rice?<br/>
I don't want it. Too heavy.<br/>
<b>Lottery Worker:</b> Wh-What? It may be heavy, but rice is a nutritious part of a balanced meal!<br/>
Well…<br/>
H-Here, how 'bout this instead? It's a coupon you can use at the Inaba Shopping District.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ai.png"/> …Better than a bale of rice. Thanks.<br/>
I'll give the other prize to you.<br/>
Here ya go.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was some kind of book, which I guess didn't totally suck.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00186.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; …Was this written by the people at the shrine?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ai.png"/> Well, we better get home.<br/>
…I had a blast today. See ya later.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean it was way more fun than sitting around with Kanji and Yosuke bitching about Teddie. Ugh, and break's almost over, too. This really sucks.</i>
