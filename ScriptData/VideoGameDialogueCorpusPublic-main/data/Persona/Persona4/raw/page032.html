<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> I wasn't crying.<br/>
Everyone was having fun out there. You forgot all about me… I was abandoned.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> No, we would never do that!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> I'm sorry… Were you lonely?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> I was bored. It made me all listless.<br/>
I'm a useless bear. I don't even know what I am.<br/>
I couldn't figure it out… No one would come visit me…<br/>
Then I thought I heard voices coming from your world. They were all having so much fun…<br/>
I was so lonely that I tried to cry. But I couldn't…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> Well, you are hollow inside…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> Shut up! Stop saying I'm hollow!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> Don't snap at me! This is your world, isn't it!?<br/>
You're the one who said you just want to live here peacefully, and made us promise to find the culprit!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> C'mon, I'm sure Teddie's just tired from thinking so much, right?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Teddie was pretty unhappy though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> I was so sad that my chest would burst and cotton would fly out…<br/>
Can I try scoring with you two someday?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Sure, go right ahead!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Can we please drop the whole "scoring" thing…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> Anyways, we wanted to ask you something! How's it been over here?<br/>
Did a girl called Rise Kujikawa show up? Can you sense anything?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> Rise Kujikawa? Hm…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> You can't tell…? You nose is kinda losing its edge lately, huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> I'm a pretty shabby bear…<br/>
Soon, I won't be useful at all. Then I'll get thrown away…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We really need him in the game, though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> I can… stay with you all?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Okay. Then we'll go look for something that'll help you search, like last time.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> I can't tell for sure. But I can kinda sense someone in here…<br/>
I think I'll be able to find her. I just need some kind of hint.<br/>
&gt; In order to make any progress, it seems you'll need more information about Rise.<br/>
&gt; You should try asking around town.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> There's a lot of things I don't understand…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't know why Teddie thinks he has to do this alone, but he doesn't.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> Thank you beary much. You're really kind, Sensei…<br/>
I'll try even harder from now on.<br/>
&gt; Teddie is doing his best to try and find his role in life…<br/>
&gt; You feel a faint bond forming between you and Teddie…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Certainly didn't expect this to happen though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> I'll be waiting here…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I heard someone talking about a guy who was Rise's biggest fan at our school, so I looked for the most pathetic neckbeard I could and sure enough was in luck.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Risette Fan:</b> Well, ask me anything you want to know! A real Risette fan like me should be able to give you the minutest details.<br/>
…Oh, you just want like, a status update?<br/>
Well, nothing's been bigger than the bomb she dropped about taking time off for a little R&amp;R.<br/>
Her blog may have some hints about why, but… well, there are a lot of theories out there.<br/>
As a fan, I'm devastated. But I guess there's not much I can do about it…<br/>
If you want more up-to-the-minute info, shouldn't you be asking someone in the media or something?<br/>
Maybe I'll send a letter through her fan club… Hmph, I wonder if those'll even reach her now…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Seeing as how he was basically no help, I decided to just go ask Rise's grandmother.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Rise's Grandmother:</b> Sometimes she leaves the house without telling me… I hope she's okay…<br/>
I've heard that some person with a camera has been wandering around recently.<br/>
I think that person was called a "papa rat" or something…<br/>
The people in this district try their best to get rid of that person, but he just keeps coming back…<br/>
I heard that he's often at the riverbank.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I headed down to the riverbank, but the paparazzi wasn't anywhere to be found. I decided to ask around.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Kind Man:</b> They're obviously from out of town, so they caught my eye.<br/>
But now that you mention it, I haven't seen any today…<br/>
&gt; It seems that they come here fairly often. Maybe you should return tomorrow…<br/>
<br/>
<i>With no progress possible, I headed to deal with some other things. First I went to the fox to get a new wish.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I figured someone with nothing to live for had to be a person in the shopping district, and sure enough I found them.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00081.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Haggard Man:</b> My grandfather started this shop… And I closed it down.<br/>
Nowadays, kids don't make models… If they want toys, Junes has a much bigger selection. I can't compete.<br/>
…A long time ago, kids used to come in here and show off the models they'd built, comparing to see who was best.<br/>
The store was so lively. Ah, those were the days…<br/>
&gt; The man sighed and stared off into the distance…<br/>
&gt; Perhaps he's the one who wrote the ema request the fox showed you.<br/>
&gt; He wants to find something to live for…<br/>
<b>Despondent Man:</b> I feel sorry for the toys that still remain in the store…<br/>
I want them to be completed, but it'd be even more pathetic if they had to be constructed by me.<br/>
The models would be happier if a young kid like you made them…<br/>
&gt; Maybe assembling one of these models will restore this man's will to live.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Souji.png"/> Want me to make one?<br/>
<b>Despondent Man:</b> Huh? W-Would you do that?<br/>
DO you have model paint at your place? You need clippers? Do you use putty!? What about detail pens…?<br/>
&gt; This man is clearly excited about the prospect of you building a model for him.<br/>
<b>Despondent Man:</b> Here, you can have this!<br/>
Pleas show it to me when you're done!<br/>
<br/>
<i>This one's going to take a while I think. Anyway, I went back to work at the daycare center while the others chased down a few more leads.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00106.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Eri.png"/> Yuu-kun, are you getting along with Mister Souji?<br/>
<b>Yuuta:</b> …No!<br/>
You don't have to come pick me up!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Eri.png"/> Yuu-kun…<br/>
*sigh *<br/>
…Do you like children?<br/>
<br/>
<i>If all children were cool like Nanako I would but evidences show that's not at all the case.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00113.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Eri.png"/> Really? You looked like you were having a lot of fun…<br/>
So, you basically just view this as your job, then? That's great.<br/>
&gt; Eri is impressed…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Eri.png"/> *sigh * It's so tiring…<br/>
I don't hate him, but…<br/>
<br/>
<i>He did seem to be a real handful.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00119.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Eri.png"/> …It's more complicated than that.<br/>
Haha, you're still a child, I see…<br/>
&gt; Eri is smiling sadly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Eri.png"/> I didn't like coming here because I'd run into the other mothers, but…<br/>
…Haha.<br/>
&gt; Eri smiled weakly…<br/>
&gt; You felt like you could understand Eri's feelings of loneliness a bit…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Interestingly the lonely housewife doesn't seem to be hitting on me, though, which is kind of refreshing really.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00127.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Other Mother:</b> Are you… Yuuta-kun's mother? Do you think it's okay for Yuuta-kun to be alone?<br/>
It's been getting dangerous lately. As a mother, I wouldn't leave my child alone.<br/>
Even if the caretaker is young, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Eri.png"/> …Yes, of course. I'm sorry.<br/>
Then… if you'll excuse me…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I spent the night playing with Nanako to remind myself why she's a much cooler kid. It's supposed to rain tomorrow, that's just lovely. Will we be able to save Rise in time?</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>6/25/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>It was raining today, very appropriate really.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00138.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> It looks like it's going to rain all day today.<br/>
They said that it's not going to last until tomorrow, so I don't think the fog's going to appear, but…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Souji.png"/> Are you worried too?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Y-Yeah…<br/>
The stuff that's on the Midnight Channel lately is pretty rough…<br/>
…But, we can't get impatient.<br/>
We need to make sure we're ready, and rescue her before things get completely out of hand!<br/>
<br/>
<i>The paparazzi was by the river, so at least there was some luck.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00146.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Photographer:</b> You're looking for information about Rise, too?<br/>
……<br/>
…Well how about this? Why don't we exchange information? You tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know.<br/>
The people in the shopping district are making it hard for me to do any information gathering.<br/>
&gt; You decide to give him some information about Rise…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I figured he might not know how different she is in real life.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00153.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Photographer:</b> Hmm, as I thought.<br/>
…To be honest, I used to do a little digging into Risette's private life.<br/>
I was surprised to discover she's totally different than on TV. You'd never recognize her in real life.<br/>
Honestly, though, when you think of an idol you should honestly just assume "manufactured personality," too.<br/>
&gt; He seemed to know some other things about Rise. Maybe you should inquire further.<br/>
<b>Photographer:</b> Do you have any new information for me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I also figured I'd confirm that she was really stressed out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00161.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Photographer:</b> She's stressed, huh…? I guess that's what it is, then…<br/>
…You see, I've been trying to find the reason behind the shocking hiatus.<br/>
And the most convincing thing I heard so far was that "Risette" got tired of her made-up personality.<br/>
Her identity as an idol, as opposed to how she normally is…<br/>
She couldn't stand living two lives anymore… That sounds about right.<br/>
Well, you didn't give me anything new, but thanks for the information. I can at least turn this into something…<br/>
&gt; So from what the paparazzo told you…<br/>
&gt; It seems Rise was acting as a "manufactured personality."<br/>
&gt; And she was worrying about her "normal self" and her "idol self."<br/>
&gt; She was surely worrying about her true self.<br/>
&gt; You seemed to have gained some insight regarding Rise…<br/>
&gt; You should report to Teddie.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It made a lot of sense, really. We headed back into the TV world.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> Hmhm… Her real self…<br/>
I see… She's just like me. The delicate, sentimental type.<br/>
Then… Hrmmm…<br/>
Whaah!? There's something out there! Is this it? Did I find her!?<br/>
Follow me!<br/>
<br/>
<i>The place Teddie led us to was pitch black.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, like the kind you always find in resort towns!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Ah, I think you're right.<br/>
……<br/>
Oh! B-But we don't have one… Our inn is not like that…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Kanji.png"/> Huh. So this is a strip joint, eh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> Strip!?<br/>
Aha! I know what that is! It's the thing zebras have, right!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> Strip… Like a zebra, right!? Right!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> It's so bring here… Even with the glasses on, my eyes hurt.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> Doesn't anyone get the joke!? Okay, let's try one more time…<br/>
Strip… It's something zebras have…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Can anyone shut this thing up!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Huh? Zebra…? Sorry, what're we talking about?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> I-I won't say it again… Let's hurry on…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We pushed into the Marukyu Striptease.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00202.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> It's making my heart pound!<br/>
<br/>
<i>The shadows were putting up stiff resistance.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00204.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> I think I'm getting a little drunk from all the pink…<br/>
<br/>
<i>A short way in Teddie felt something strange nearby.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00206.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> ……<br/>
I can smell it!<br/>
I smell something! My nose is sniffing out some kind of clue!<br/>
<br/>
<i>And sure enough Rise's Shadow was around.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> But something's not right…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> It must be her other self…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Shadow_Rise.png"/> Hello, all you fans out there! Thanks for coming today!<br/>
Today, you're gonna see every last inch of me!<br/>
What's that? You don't believe me? Ahahah! Okay, okay!<br/>
Then why don't we-Oh, but you won't be able to see with all this smoke, huh?<br/>
Okie-dokie! Just follow me a little further in and I'll prove that I'm every bit as good as my word!<br/>
<br/>
<i>These just get worse and worse.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00221.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Kanji.png"/> W-Were we like that…?<br/>
That's… going kinda far…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Sheesh, the roar of the crowd is insane this time… It's making me feel sick.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> If people really are watching this… we gotta do something, and fast.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Shadow_Rise.png"/> All right, Risetteers! Don't touch that dial!<br/>
When we come back, you'll get a good, long look at the real me! Maru-Q!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> W-We'd better move it! This is a thousand times worse than just hearing a few nasty secrets!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> The Shadows are really getting aggravated!<br/>
What we just saw is what that Rise girl is suppressing!<br/>
She'll be in trouble at this rate!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Kanji.png"/> So, guess I'm on the rescue team now. Alright, let's hurry up and go!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Just like in the castle and sauna, we started hearing creepy disembodied voices.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-P4-00234.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Shadow_Rise.png"/> Goooood evening, everyone! I'm Risette!<br/>
Thanks for being such faithful viewers!<br/>
I'm tired of diets! Enough with going to the gym! Good thing there's something that even I can handle!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> I've had enough of this place too! Urgh, I'm getting all dizzy…<br/>
Sensei, are you all right?<br/>
Why don't we call it a day today? I'm getting really dizzy…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Shadow_Rise.png"/> Oh!?<br/>
You've come so far… Does that mean you're a fan of mine?<br/>
Seriously!? That makes Risette sooo happy!<br/>
Since you tried so hard, I wonder if I should do something special for you…<br/>
…But not here!<br/>
First, you gotta prove your love just a liiiitle bit more!<br/>
I'll be waiting!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> ……!<br/>
S-Sensei! I'm gonna try even harder!<br/>
<br/>
<i>That bear… though after what happened later I guess I shouldn't be so hard on him.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-P4-00250.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Shadow_Rise.png"/> I'm rooting for you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> Whaa…?<br/>
The girl Sensei's trying to rescue is cheering him on…<br/>
I dunno… It's kinda weird…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And when we got up to the next floor she turned off the fucking lights on us.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-P4-00255.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Shadow_Rise.png"/> But still, I'm a little embarrassed…<br/>
So I'm gonna turn out the lights!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> Whoa! It's so dark in there!<br/>
This is dangerous! Be careful going onward, Sensei!<br/>
<br/>
<i>One of the curtains was sealed tight.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-P4-00260.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Shadow_Rise.png"/> You can't go in yet, mmm?<br/>
Over here, over here! Hurry!<br/>

…Are you ready, Sensei?<br/>
<br/>
<i>She was waiting in the dark on the other side with a giant Shadow.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-P4-00269.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Shadow_Rise.png"/> Look! C'mon, look at me!<br/>
<br/>
<b>Boss Battle- Amorous Snake</b><br/>
The Amorous Snake's got a pretty standard sort of gimmick. He uses Stagnant Air to make the party more prone to status ailments then uses attacks that can cause status to ruin us. The fight is a joke, though, because he's weak against Fire. I want to say he's a huge threat but it's just not so, literally just burn him down.<br/>
<br/>
<i>As the ashes settled, we noticed Rise's Shadow had split. At least the damn lights were on again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-P4-00272.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> We did it, Sensei! What a relief… We can go now!<br/>
<br/>
<i>And as before the voices got stranger and stranger as we pushed forward.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-P4-00274.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Shadow_Rise.png"/> Why don't I tell all you fans a little about myself?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> What's this?<br/>
What's she up to?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Shadow_Rise.png"/> Hmmm… What should I talk about first…?<br/>
Ummm… Never mind. Maybe some other time.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-P4-00280.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Shadow_Rise.png"/> My work right now…<br/>
Yeah, I think it's really fulfilling.<br/>
I longed to be an idol ever since I was a kid. Every day's so much fun!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> It's really fulfilling for me, too, since I'm with you guys, Sensei!<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Shadow_Rise.png"/> Hmmm…<br/>
I guess someone who's kind and clean?<br/>
Oh, looks don't matter that much.<br/>
I actually don't really like handsome-looking guys.<br/>
I mean, it's what's on the inside that really counts, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Teddie.png"/> I see… So one's insides are important…<br/>
But I'm all empty…<br/>

<b>Boss Battle- Shadow Rise</b><br/>
Shadow Rise is a different sort of fight. She starts out with a fixed pattern. She'll cast Agi, then Maragi, then Agilao, then Maragion. Once she's finished that she'll start mixing some other stuff in before potentially starting it over if you take too long to take her to about 66%, at which point you'll trigger a vocal taunt and a slight pattern change.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-P4-00335.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Shadow_Rise.png"/> I've got a ways to go until I show my true self… You ain't seen nothin' yet!<br/>
<br/>
Rise will also throw some other magic in now, as well as Attacks. None of it is particularly threatening, though. Indeed, nothing in the fight is a real worry until you get to 33%. Then things get a little… interesting.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-P4-00337.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Shadow_Rise.png"/> You might as well die, then!<br/>
No touching allowed. Ahaha!<br/>
<br/>
Rise uses a spell called Supreme Insight and analyzes our party, which means we are no longer able to hit her with any attack. At this point we just need to live through three turns of her unimpressive and anemic offense.<br/>
<br/>

Here, stand up.<br/>
I'm sorry… You must've been in a lot of pain up to now.<br/>
You're part of me, but I kept refusing to admit you existed…<br/>
I was trying to figure out who the real me was.<br/>
But I realize now that I was on the wrong track.<br/>
There is no "real" me. It just doesn't exist.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-FlatTeddie.png"/> There's no... real me…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Rise.png"/> You… me… even Risette… They were all born from me.<br/>

<br/>
<i>It seems its name is Himiko, a shaman queen from ancient history.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-P4-00407.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> Rise-chan! Careful!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Rise.png"/> I'm all right… Hey, you're the one who came to the store, right…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, yeah. And these guys came with me.<br/>
&gt; You briefly introduced yourselves.<br/>

<br/>
<i>Teddie was just repeating the same thing over and over…</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Kanji.png"/> H-Hey, Teddie…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Rise.png"/> No, get back!<br/>
Something's coming out of him…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Shadow_Teddie.png"/> Real? Me?<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Rise.png"/> I believe so, but it seems like there's more… I felt some powerful presence intervene…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-FlatTeddie.png"/> Wh-What's going on!?<br/>
Wh-Whoaa!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Shadow_Teddie.png"/> The truth is unattainable…<br/>
It will always be shrouded in fog.<br/>
Though you reach through the murk and the gloom to grasp something, you have no means to know it is the truth…<br/>
In which case, why…? What sense is there in yearning for truth?<br/>
Close your eyes. Lie to yourself. Live in blissful ignorance… It is a much smarter way to exist.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-FlatTeddie.png"/> Wh-What're you talking about!? I don't understand a word you're saying!<br/>
You're just making it sound difficult because I'm not that smart!<br/>
How rude! Maybe you can't tell, but I'm thinking as hard as I can!<br/>
<br/>
<i>The other Teddie continued his grim monologue.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Shadow_Teddie.png"/> At your core, you know this… You just cannot accept it. So you seek an alternate form… a denial of your nature.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Shadow_Teddie.png"/> Shall I spell it out for you?<br/>
You are but a mere-<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Teddie!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Shadow_Teddie.png"/> It is the same for you all… You undergo suffering because of your search for the truth…<br/>
This world is filled with thick, heavy fog…<br/>
How can you find something when you know not what you search for?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Even if we don't know what truth we're looking for, it has to be here somewhere.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Shadow_Teddie.png"/> Obtaining the truth is simple. All you have to do is believe that it is the truth…<br/>
Then I will grant you one truth…<br/>
You will all die here.<br/>

<br/>
<b>Boss Battle- Shadow Teddie</b><br/>
Now things get serious. First thing's first, Shadow Teddie laughs off Ice so don't even try it. For the first quarter or so of his health he's pretty simple. He'll use Marakunda to debuff your party's defense, Foolish Whisper to try and Mute your party, and Heat Wave, a physical attack that hits everyone. A Persona like Unicorn with Dekunda is pretty valuable here to negate the Marakunda. Things get a little more exciting when we drag him down a bit. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-P4-00464.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-P4-00466.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-P4-00467.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Teddie will use Ultra Charge at this point. This will skip his next turn charging. And on the turn after?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-P4-00468.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
At which point you need to have everyone Guard, because Teddie is going to use Nihil Hand. I'm pretty sure this kills anyone who didn't guard. What's more, Teddie will start mixing things up at this point. He gains Mind Charge and Mabufula at this point. He'll always use Mind Charge first at this point, so you know when you need to have Yukiko guard if she's with you. Teddie adds another annoying little wrinkle at 50%.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-P4-00470.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
He then uses an attack called Nullity Guidance on someone, which is an automatic crit that dizzies them. Then he'll use his One More to start Ultra Charge again. This gives us fewer free turns while he's Charging. There's no real tactical change on Teddie's part until 25% though.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-P4-00472.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Teddie throws out two Nullity Guidances before this Ultra Charge starts. Now he'll also start throwing out Mabufulas whenever he feels like. If he gets a One More from them he'll often use Ice Break on the MC. Just keep things going nice and steady though and this shouldn't be a real problem.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-FlatTeddie.png"/> I said this before, but… I can sense something special about you, Sensei.<br/>
There must be something that only I can do… That's how I feel when I'm with Sensei.<br/>
That's why I'm gonna get stronger! To find my special thing! Raaaawr!<br/>
&gt; Teddie is looking at you with fire in his eyes…<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Adachi.png"/> Whoa, there! Careful now, Dojima-san.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Dojima.png"/> Ow!<br/>
Dammit…! Who put a shtep here!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Adachi.png"/> That'd be the carpenters, Sir. C'mon, don't take your anger out on the house. That won't solve anything.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Dojima.png"/> Whooo… I'm hooome. Nanako! I'm baaack!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Nanako.png"/> W-Welcome back…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Adachi.png"/> Oh, hi Nanako-chan. Sorry, but could you go get his futon ready?<br/>
Phew! I think he had a little too much to drink, haha.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Dojima.png"/> How else… *hic *… am I supposed to deal with this crap!?<br/>
Friggin' fancy-talkin' kid…<br/>
I've… I've been in this line'a work… since you were all learnin' yer times tables!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Adachi.png"/> The prefectural police sent in special investigational support.<br/>
'Cause you know, we haven't really made any progress on the serial murders since they started in April… Haha.<br/>
So this "special support" is supposedly a hot-shot detective from a well-known private agency…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Turned out there was some young detective in town… Wait, does that sound familiar? Too tired.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Dojima.png"/> Awww, he's a brat like any other. Ain't nothin' he can do to help. *hic *<br/>
He goes on and on about deductions and… deductions… Heh.<br/>
Ace or no ace, the prefeckshure oughtta be more careful about giving us brats to babysit…<br/>
Condes… Condescendin' bashtards… *hic *<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Adachi.png"/> The kid said, as long as he can be of assistance in solving a difficult case, he won't require a reward.<br/>
Well, you can imagine the shine the higher-ups took to him after that. So we can't exactly turn him down…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Dojima.png"/> Adachi!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Adachi.png"/> Gah, sorry! Me and my big mouth…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Dojima.png"/> You run your jaw like this is all shome kinda joke…<br/>
It's your fault to begin with, for jumping the gun and hauling in that Peeping Tom!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Adachi.png"/> Oh… Haha, um…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Dojima.png"/> And you!<br/>
You'cn take your share of the blame, too… Always wandering around crime scenes whenever somethin' happens…<br/>
&gt; You were scolded by Dojima…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Nanako.png"/> His futon's ready.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Adachi.png"/> Alright, Dojima-san, up and at 'em. Nanako-chan got your futon all ready for you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Dojima.png"/> Nnh… Mmmm…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Nanako.png"/> ……<br/>
