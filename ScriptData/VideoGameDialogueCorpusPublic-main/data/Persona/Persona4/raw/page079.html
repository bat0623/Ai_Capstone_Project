<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> How could it be her…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> I know what you're thinking, but… Nanako-chan does fit the pattern.<br/>
She wasn't seen… but she was heard.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> What!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> Do you remember the politician who visited a local school, and made the news several times?<br/>
In those interviews, he always quoted a particular student he spoke with.<br/>
The child became well-known while remaining anonymous… That girl was Nanako-chan!<br/>
A reporter who took interest in this released her photo and interview using her real name in today's evening paper.<br/>
But even before that… This is a small, rural town. Her identity must have been circulating for quite some time.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Oh my God…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> I should've realized it much sooner…<br/>
But I was hung up on the idea of people who were "shown" on TV… It didn't occur to me that this would qualify…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Wh-What're we going to do? Nanako-chan's home alone right now, isn't she!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> I'm on my way there as we speak to check on her!<br/>
Yosuke-senpai is heading to the police station!<br/>
He said he called Kanji-kun too. They'll explain the situation there.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Alright, I'll join them right away! And I'll let Yukiko and Rise-chan know!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> Yes, please do!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm not sure how much time passed, but eventually I heard a commotion outside.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Dojima.png"/> Hey, what do you think you're doing!? I didn't say you could go in there!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Nanako-chan's missing!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Dojima.png"/> Wha--!? What do you mean!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Naoto's on the phone, calling from Nanako-chan's… I mean, your house.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Dojima.png"/> Shirogane!? You there? What the hell's going on!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> I'm at your house right now. The front door's open and there's no one inside.<br/>
…I'm afraid that Nanako-chan has been kidnapped by our serial killer.<br/>
Surely you must've known, Dojima-san!? The case isn't over yet!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Dojima.png"/> ……<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dojima tried to reach Nanako, with no luck.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Recorded Message:</b> The number you have dialed is unavailable right now. The phone may be switched off or outside our coverage area.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Dojima.png"/> Nanako…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Adachi.png"/> Dojima-san…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Dojima.png"/> Is this true? Has Nanako really been…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Souji.png"/> We have to hurry.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Dojima.png"/> Why…? Why Nanako!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Um, it's probably because the media-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Adachi.png"/> Wh-What are you doing?<br/>
<b>Duty Officer:</b> Traffic Division, Ohta speaking.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Dojima.png"/> There's been a kidnapping! Get your men on it immediately! Start with checkpoints along the highway!<br/>
<b>Duty Officer:</b> Checkpoints!? Umm, could you explain the situation a little more-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Dojima.png"/> Quit griping and get to it!<br/>
The victim's a seven-year-old girl… My daughter!<br/>
<b>Duty Officer:</b> Your daughter? Wait… What about the scene? What makes you think this is a kidnapping?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Dojima.png"/> Th-That's…<br/>
Look, this could be connected to that multiple murder case!<br/>
<b>Duty Officer:</b> Connected…? But we caught the killer.<br/>
How long has she been missing? Have you received any notices or ransom letters?<br/>
<br/>
<i>At least Dojima believed us.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Duty Officer:</b> Um, a-alright… I'll try contacting each of the departments…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Adachi.png"/> Even if you tell 'em this is connected to the murders, we can't prove it…<br/>
And everyone on the force thinks this case is over and done with…<br/>
Wh-Where are you going!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Dojima.png"/> I'm gonna go look for my daughter!<br/>
If this is connected to that murder case, the top brass won't accept the facts until it's too late.<br/>
I'm not gonna wait for those clowns!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Adachi.png"/> But do you even have any ideas or leads on who took her!? If they used a car, there's no way-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Dojima.png"/> Shut up! That's why I'm hurrying!<br/>
&gt; Dojima left by himself…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Adachi.png"/> Augh… What am I gonna do? Dojima-san's run off half-cocked…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Adachi-san, we'll go look for her, too! So please… let him go!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Adachi.png"/> Huh? You know I can't…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Just then, the others ran in.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Adachi.png"/> Whoa, hey… If I let all you guys in here, then I'm really in trouble!<br/>
Besides, we don't even know if this thing's-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Quit your bitching! Now ain't the time for that shit!<br/>
The hell are we sitting here for when this guy's family's in danger!?<br/>
You gonna own up if something happens!? Huh!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> Kanji-kun!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Adachi.png"/> I know how you feel, but if you don't tell me what's going on, there's really nothing I can do…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> Ah, so you agree to release him once we explain the situation? Very well, then.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Adachi.png"/> N-No, that's not what I meant…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> In any case, if we run out blindly, we'll have no idea where to begin.<br/>
Let's all take a moment to stop and sort out the situation. Perhaps this will help Adachi-san understand as well.<br/>
There's no doubt in my mind that this is a kidnapping by the same culprit who was behind the others.<br/>
Now. Consider that the front door at Nanako-chan's house was open.<br/>
I examined it, and found no trace that entry had been forced…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> You mean… Nanako-chan opened the door herself?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> Precisely.<br/>
The culprit didn't sneak in. He came boldly up to the front door and pressed the doorbell.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yukiko.png"/> Like how it was for all of us…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Adachi was already getting lost. Not a surprise I guess.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> But the circumstances are different for her, as compared to us.<br/>
Remember what Nanako-chan said when we were at the hot springs?<br/>
"I always do what my dad tells me, like not opening the door for strangers."<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Teddie2.png"/> So is the killer… someone Nana-chan knows?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> Senpai, do you have any insight into this possibility?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Souji.png"/> Someone at her school?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> No… I doubt she'd let her guard down for anyone who rarely came to their house…<br/>
And I'd rule out her classmates. This is beyond the capacity of an elementary school student.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Hmm… I don't think we can limit ourselves to people Nanako-chan knows…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> I agree… Then let us change our perspective slightly.<br/>
We know for certain that the culprit must be using a large-screen TV.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Adachi.png"/> Huh…? TV? What?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> Each victim was taken at a different scene, yet was thrown into a TV almost immediately after being kidnapped…<br/>
I would go as far as to say that it took place in front of their houses.<br/>
Therefore, the culprit must be taking a TV with him as he goes.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> You think he's using a car?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> Given the efficiency of the culprit's methods, I would assume a vehicle larger than a sedan. However…<br/>
No unusual vehicles have been sighted. I'd expect someone to notice, since most of the victims vanished during the day…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Rise.png"/> So it's someone Nanako-chan knows, who has a car… But it's a car that can't be seen?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yukiko.png"/> I think we can rule out the possibility that no one happened to see the vehicle…<br/>
Especially since it's happened so many times now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> A car no one would notice…? Is there such a thing? What would it be…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>A vehicle nobody would notice. A vehicle large enough to hold a big-screen TV. Why didn't we think of it before?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00111.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> That's right… Now I remember…<br/>
A delivery came! It was a delivery truck!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Rise.png"/> No one looks twice at a delivery truck, no matter where it's parked…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> And if it were a local company, it'd be the same deliveryman every time so he's not a "stranger" to Nanako-chan.<br/>
She must've received packages form him during the times she was home alone, meaning we wouldn't know his face…<br/>
Adachi-san! Is there anyone who fits this profile!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Adachi.png"/> A profile formed by a bunch of kids talking it over…?<br/>
Let's see… A delivery company, huh?<br/>
I dunno, take it from a detective… I think this is gonna be… a lot more difficult than-<br/>
Hey…!<br/>
Maybe you're not too far off base…<br/>
Dojima-san put this stuff together to reinvestigate the first case-the murder of that announcer…<br/>
And there's a deliveryman mentioned right here…<br/>
I better go tell Dojima-san!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> After resigning from his last job, he took up the family delivery business… Before that, he was… a council secretary!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'd seen him around town so damn many times. How could I have missed it?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00127.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> The enka singer's husband!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> All we know about him is his occupation, but I'd say that's enough of a lead to tell us where to go next.<br/>
The address is… It's not far from here!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Adachi.png"/> *sigh * I give him the clue, and he still finds an excuse to chew me out…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Is he gonna be okay…? The killer's not just a normal guy.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Teddie2.png"/> Nana-chan…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Adachi-san!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Adachi.png"/> If there's been a break in the case, I'd better hurry to the scene.<br/>
I'll just have to hope nothing happens here while I'm gone… I didn't see anything.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> Adachi-san…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Let's go to Namatame's place! Dojima-san's probably on this way now!<br/>
<br/>

*gasp *<br/>
<br/>
<i>When we got there, Adachi was already checking out Dojima.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Dojima.png"/> Wh-Where's Nanako…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> Hello? We need an ambulance, quickly. There's been an accident. One adult male is injured…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Adachi.png"/> That's right, I should call backup, too! We gotta find Namatame!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Dojima.png"/> Nanako… Where's Nanako…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> *gasp * What happened…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Dojima.png"/> …was on my way to Namatame's house… when I saw him… drive past me…<br/>
I… I gave chase… and he… dammit…<br/>
Where's Nanako…? And Namatame…?<br/>
Find them… Please…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> But how…?<br/>
Oh yeah, maybe there's clues in the truck!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Adachi.png"/> Wait, you can't! We need to preserve the scene!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> Then allow me. If it rains again while we wait, the information we need will be lost regardless.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Look! There really is a TV in there!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> Yes, large enough for persons of any size to fit through.<br/>
I also recovered a diary from the driver's seat… Most likely kept by Namatame himself.<br/>
<br/>
<i>There was no question it was him.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00168.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> "Save"? the hell's he mean by that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> *gasp * This… It's a list of the victims' home addresses!<br/>
Mayumi Yamano, Saki Konishi…<br/>
Yukiko Amagi, Kanji Tatsumi, Rise Kujikawa…<br/>
Even the victims who survived and were never released to the public are written here.<br/>
I note that Mr. Morooka's address is absent from the list…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Adachi.png"/> Wow… Then that settles it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> The last date is today's…<br/>
"I can't believe such a small child appeared on it. I must save this child, no matter what."<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Is that… about Nanako-chan!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> "I managed to take her to safety.<br/>
"The police have been active lately…<br/>
"This will probably be the last time I write in this diary. I've done everything I can…"<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> It's clear now… He used the same trick on all the victims.<br/>
He'd just ring the bell, like he was making a normal delivery, then throw the victim into the TV in his truck…<br/>
Namatame is the killer!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> We need to go save Nanako-chan! Here, let's use this TV and-<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Teddie2.png"/> Definitely. There's no mistake.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> The police should be pursuing Namatame, so let's focus on saving Nanako-chan.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Yeah. We're the only ones who can.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Rise.png"/> We'll save her no matter what.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yukiko.png"/> I often thought it might be impossible, but we've finally cornered the culprit…<br/>
We made it this far… We won't let him take Nanako-chan's life!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kanji.png"/> Yeah… This is it! Let's go all-out and get it done!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Teddie2.png"/> I made a promise with Nana-chan!<br/>
I said that we'd play again… and that everything would be okay… I promised her that!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, so let's save her.<br/>
We're doing it for Dojima-san, too. Hehe, he'll owe us another watermelon.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Naoto.png"/> Regardless, we must do whatever we can with what we have now.<br/>
This is something only we can accomplish…<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah. We do this the same way as always.<br/>
All we gotta do is find Nanako-chan before the next foggy day and get her out of there.<br/>
Nothing to it. Let's keep calm, be careful, and get it done.<br/>

<i>What we found wasn't like anything we'd ever seen in the TV.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yukiko.png"/> This… is Nanako-chan's…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Rise.png"/> It's so beautiful… It's like a storybook vision of heaven.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Like heaven, huh…<br/>
Deep down, Nanako-chan must really miss her…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yukiko.png"/> I'm sure she does. She's only a child…<br/>
&gt; In her heart of hearts, Nanako seems to have missed her deceased mother…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yukiko.png"/> We have to do everything in our power to rescue her!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Souji.png"/> I'll need all of you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Teddie.png"/> Of course!<br/>
We're gonna rescue Nana-chan, no matter what!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> We can find Namatame later and give him what's coming to him then.<br/>
First, we need to rescue Nanako-chan!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We prepared for our most tense rescue. We couldn't imagine the horrors that were waiting behind those gates…</i><br/>
