<i>Learn new things every day. Case in point, they get some mail-order show out of Tatsumi here.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Dark-Haired Girl:</b> Have you been watching that mail-order show that's on TV every Sunday? I never miss it!<br/>
<b>Athletic Girl:</b> You really love those kinds of shows, don't you, Michi?<br/>
I remember that you said you bought a really flashy skimpy bathing suit last time...<br/>
When are you ever going to wear it?<br/>
<b>Dark-Haired Girl:</b> Oh, I'll wear it... when the time is right.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I smelled something sort of... strange when I was talking to Chie on the roof, which led to revelation two.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Come to think of it, there was a woman looking for a snack that doesn't taste like a snack.<br/>
&gt; Chie may know something...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> A snack that doesn't taste like a snack...?<br/>
Hmmmm, I have no idea...<br/>
My snacks taste like snacks... You want some?<br/>
&gt; You obtained Meat Gumx3 from Chie.<br/>
&gt; You should try giving this to the woman...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Speaking of snacks, you ever get hungry inside the TV? Maybe I should bring something in with me next time...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Good god, this Meat Gum smells horrible. If she can still snack after some of this there's no curing her. Anyway, I decided to train a bit with Chie.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You decided to train with Chie.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Allllright! Today's the day!<br/>
&gt; Chie is enthusiastic today as well.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nanako was walking home from school around this time and ran into us.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Oh, Nanako-chan!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Nanako.png"/> What are you doing?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Hm? Training, of course!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Nanako.png"/> Training...<br/>
Who are you fighting with, Chie?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Hmmmm...<br/>
Myself... I guess...?<br/>
...Heheh, just kidding!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Nanako.png"/> Wow, cool!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Y-You think...? Hahaha...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Huh!? N-No way! Wh-Where!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Nanako.png"/> It just landed on your back.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Ahhhhhh!<br/>
Get it off! Get it off me!<br/>
&gt; Nanako took the grasshopper off Chie's back.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Nanako.png"/> ...You don't like grasshoppers?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> I'm no good with anything with thin, jointed legs! Or anything creepy or squirmy!<br/>
Ack, now I can't get 'em out of my mind! I can't stand those things!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Nanako.png"/> But they're cute...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> ...You're like Yukiko.<br/>
Oh, see, 'cause Yukiko's fine around bugs.<br/>
But me, I totally lose it... Kinda funny, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's sort of surprising because I've seen her bury her foot in, well, Yosuke and Shadows alike.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Th-That's not true!<br/>
It's not...<br/>
&gt; Somehow, Chie looks happy.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Nanako.png"/> A lot of kids in my class don't like bugs.<br/>
It's not just you. Don't worry!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Nanako-chan... Ooh, you don't know how happy that makes me. Thanks!<br/>
C'mon, you wanna train too?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Nanako.png"/> Okay!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Let's start with form. I'll teach you a kata...<br/>
&gt; Chie and Nanako began training...<br/>
&gt; ...You sent Nanako home before it got dark.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> I'm gonna get over my fear of bugs. I don't wanna look like a sissy next to Nanako-chan!<br/>
All I have to do is think of them as Shadows! Then I'll be able to grab a whole fistful!<br/>
......<br/>
I-I just gave myself goosebumps...<br/>
G-Getting used to bugs might take a while, but I won't lose to Shadows!<br/>
&gt; You felt Chie's burning passion...<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Chie has grown yet deeper...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh, and Chie has seriously been watching too many movies, she claims she's learned how to, and I quote, 'dragon kick Shadows to the Milky Way.'<br/>
She offered a demonstration but I'm just going to take her word for it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; After finishing your training, you walked partway home with Chie.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We're going back into the TV after Kanji on Monday, I've decided. We can't leave him in that damned place.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>5/22/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>That mail-order show was on today.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00082.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You've never seen this show before. This must be the shopping program you'd heard about.<br/>
<b>Tanaka:</b> Hello, everyone! Welcome to the home shopping show, "Tanaka's Amazing Commodities"!<br/>
<b>Singers:</b> Granter of your desires!<br/>
<b>Tanaka:</b> I'm your host, Tanaka, with a live presentation of my Amazing Commodities!<br/>
We'll show you great items at unbeatable prices! Ooh, you won't be able to touch that dial!<br/>
Now, let's introduce today's products!<br/>
Adios Shoes! This is a limited edition pair of high-quality shoes!<br/>
But wait, there's more!<br/>
I'll add two Slimming Foods to the Adios Shoes! All this for only 5,980 yen!<br/>
We've got another fantastic product on sale today!<br/>
One Medical Kit! It's very helpful in emergencies!<br/>
What can I do to sweeten this pot for you? Ooh, I know!<br/>
For this one, I'll add four Medicines to your Medical Kit for 2,980 yen!<br/>
These deals are so popular, we're only allowing one order per person!<br/>
Which would you like to purchase today!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>This mail order show is almost as freaky as there being a weapon store in town, that he sells things like that. Anyway, I figured Chie might be interested in the shoes and called in an order.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00105.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Tanaka:</b> Today's sale is over, but you'll get another chance next Sunday on this very same channel! See you next time!<br/>
&gt; You hear the same song again.<br/>
<b>Singers:</b> Here comes Tanakaaaaa Over the airwaves to youuuuu<br/>
&gt; The shopping program has ended.<br/>
&gt; You turned off the TV.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Gameplay Notes:</b><br/>
Tanaka's back, and this time it works a little differently. Now we have two options each Sunday. In general it's either a piece of gear and some odd healing items or some rare consumables.<br/>
We also get a Prize Sticker, which we'll need for a Fox quest and which we can use to get some extra rewards. When you've got a Sunday and money it's worth it to check it out, since it uses no time.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh, and I finally got rid of that damn Meat Gum.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00111.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Slim Woman:</b> It smells juicy, raw, and yet sweet... Is this the rumored Meat Gum!?<br/>
*gulp*<br/>
Hey, can I have a bit? I want to try it.<br/>
&gt; You gave the woman Meat Gum.<br/>
<b>Slim Woman:</b> Urp!!<br/>
Wh-What is this!? It's chewy meat!<br/>
This is also considered a snack!? The world of snacks is indeed vast and infinite.<br/>
...Well, that was certainly different and odd. When I think "snack" I'll definitely recall this taste now.<br/>
Thank you... Now I won't linger in front of the Shiroku Store any more.<br/>
Oh, yes. I need to visit the shrine. I made a wish to hate snacks there.<br/>
I'll use my snack money as an offering!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm glad that Meat Gum could bring someone some happiness because carrying it around wasn't doing so for me. Anyway the fox seemed happy.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>Calling it an early night, we're headed back to that damn sauna and who knows what's waiting for us in there?</i><br/>
