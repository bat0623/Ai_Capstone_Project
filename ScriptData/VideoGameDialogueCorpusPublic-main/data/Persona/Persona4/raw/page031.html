<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> You know the tofu store Marukyu? The owners of that place have the same last name, Kujikawa!<br/>
<b>Male Student:</b> Seriously!? Hey, I practically live next door!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> I've been hearing that there's a big crowd at Marukyu.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> I'm not surprised.<br/>
But was it really her on yesterday's Midnight Channel? Didn't she seem a little… different?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> It was her, no doubt about it!<br/>
Her curves… Her posture… Even her beautiful, slim legs!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> …What's that look for?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Anyways, I'm positive! Right!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke's really creepy sometimes. And by sometimes I mean all the times.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> I don't really care about celebrities, but it's not like I got anything better to do… Sure, I'll tag along.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Sorry, but me and Yukiko have plans. Give us a call if anything comes up.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Well, shall we get going? But let's be clear on one thing: we're not spectators.<br/>
We're on an investigation, got it?<br/>
&gt; You decided to go to the Marukyu tofu shop.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dojima's partner was directing traffic outside.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Adachi.png"/> Oh, it's you guys.<br/>
Ai yi yi… These gawkers keep streaming in with their cars, trying to park in the middle of the shopping district.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Why's that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Adachi.png"/> Don't you know? Rise Kujikawa's here.<br/>
Hey, did you see her already? Is she there? Which is it?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Huh…? We're askin' why a plainclothes detective is here doing traffic control.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Adachi.png"/> Oh… Uh, well… The Inaba Police Department isn't that big, and we don't have enough staff…<br/>
Well, I still have work to do, so I'll see you later.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Dude… You managed to scare off a police detective on active duty…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> I wasn't trying to scare the guy, I just said what I was thinking.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> But you're right, it's weird for the police to come out like this…<br/>
Hey… You think the police suspect that Rise might be the next target, too?<br/>
<br/>
<i>It seemed our suspicion on that was confirmed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> Dammit… I told him not to leave his post…<br/>
What are you guys doing-<br/>
Hm? Kanji Tatsumi…!? Are you friends with them?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Like it's any of your business…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> …If you say so. So I'll ask again: What are you all doing here?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I played it cool, as always.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> …Is that so?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, um…<br/>
W-Well, who wouldn't wanna come check it out if they found out an idol's family ran an ordinary tofu store?<br/>
I'm, uh… a big fan!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> ……<br/>
*sigh * Fine.<br/>
But remember. She might be a celebrity, but this is her home. Try not to bother them too much.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> That cop's your uncle, eh…?<br/>
So, what the hell was that about? Are you guys under suspicion…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Well, they did take us in once…<br/>
But we can't just tell him everything, right?<br/>
If we say anything about the other world, we only look more suspicious. They'll be watching us all the time.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Got a point there…<br/>
<b>Young Man's Voice:</b> Man, there's no one in there but the old lady. Risette isn't here after all…<br/>
<b>Older Man's Voice:</b> I heard that she really is already here, but it might've just been a rumor…<br/>
Well, it was fun while it lasted.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> A rumor!? What, she's not here!? Seriously!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Pfft, you sound like the world's about to end.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Shuddup!<br/>
Anyways, now that all those people are gone, we might as well check inside. I'll buy something.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I seemed to recall that Yosuke can't eat tofu normally, so I suggested something a little more his speed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> How'd you know I can't eat tofu? Wow, that's considerate of you.<br/>
&gt; Yosuke seems somewhat happy…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Wait, what's ganmodoki again? Is it the kind with a rice cake in it?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> There's no rice cakes in 'em… They're sorta like… fried tofu patties with veggies and stuff in, and…<br/>
&gt; Yosuke received a crash course on ganmodoki…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Ohhh, okay, I know what you mean! I think I can eat that.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed in to get some tofu. We didn't see anyone around at first.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Sure enough… The only one here is your typical old lady. *sigh *<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Man, why don't you just ask if she's in back?<br/>
'Scuse me!<br/>
<b>Old Lady:</b> Yes, may I help you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> What the--!? Then, who's that…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Turned out we're just idiots.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> ……?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Uh… Are you Rise?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Yeah. So?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> No way… Are you really Risette?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> What do you want?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Huh…? Oh, sorry, um… Some tofu, please!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Tofu…? Which kind?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Huh? Wh-Which one's which again…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> If you're going to eat it by itself, you should go with silken. Momen's better for cooking… Depends how you use it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> U-Um…<br/>
Psst, Kanji! Order something!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Wha--!? Why're you making me do it!? You already picked ganmo a second ago!<br/>
Dude here wants three ganmodoki.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Oh, I see…<br/>
I'll go get them.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Rise was definitely not as energetic as we were used to seeing on TV.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Man, but it's really her… I'm so glad I came! Mission comple-<br/>
Wait, we haven't done what we came here for yet!<br/>
Um…!<br/>
H-Have you noticed anything weird lately?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Weird…? Like stalkers?<br/>
Are you guys fans of mine?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> I wouldn't say "we," but yeah, dude here's a big fan.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> You little…! Why'd you let that slip!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Her curves, her posture, even her beautiful slim legs… Ya finished checkin' em out yet, or what?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Waaaaaaah! Y-You're doing this on purpose, aren't you!?<br/>
I didn't say that! I never said any of that!<br/>
Maybe you know already, but it's been dangerous in Inaba lately. That's why we've been investigating some stuff.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Oh yeah?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Sorry, um… Let's see… Do you know about the TV show that comes on at midnight?<br/>
I mean, it's not like regularly scheduled programming… How do I explain this…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>It seemed Rise had seen the Midnight Channel as well!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00106.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, you know about it…<br/>
Wait… What!? You mean you saw it last night!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> I heard the rumors from some friends of mine.<br/>
But that girl last night wasn't me. I've never been filmed wearing that swimsuit before.<br/>
And the bustline…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Mine aren't that big.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Oh yeah, I see what you mean now…<br/>
I-I mean… What am I saying!? U-Um, I'm sorry…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> …Don't apologize so much.<br/>
You're funny.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, she smiled.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> What is that show about, anyway?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Well, we're not too sure either…<br/>
But you know there's been stuff happening here, right?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Well, we've warned her at least.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00122.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> I know this is sudden, but we're not lying.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, that's why we thought you should know about it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Huh… So that wasn't a dream.<br/>
I was tired yesterday, but I couldn't sleep.<br/>
And it was raining, so I decided to try that rumor I'd heard about…<br/>
…Hmm.<br/>
Alright, thanks… I'll be careful.<br/>
Here you go, three ganmo. That'll be 600 yen.<br/>
There's extra tofu in there for everyone… A little thank-you for worrying about me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Whoa, seriously? Thanks!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Yosuke-senpai, you can't eat tofu, right? Want me to take yours?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Hell no! I always eat what people give me.<br/>
&gt; Rise gave you a block of tofu.<br/>
&gt; Maybe you can eat it for dinner…<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Adachi.png"/> Seems like the crowds are thinning out, so we'll be leaving now.<br/>
If it gets rowdy again, just give us a call at the station.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Okay.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> Uh, hang on a second. Sorry, but there's some things I'd like to ask you.<br/>
You do know that there have been multiple violent cases around here lately, yeah?<br/>
Have you seen anyone suspicious around?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Not really… It's been like always.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> Like always… Well, you're an idol, so I imagine you deal with folks like fans, paparazzi and stalkers quite often.<br/>
What made you take a break from showbiz?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Does it really matter?<br/>
…I just needed a rest.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> And have you registered for school?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> I'm planning on going to Yasogami High. It was the closest.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00153.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> That's why, well…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> I might be kidnapped, right?<br/>
I've been told that before. Don't worry, I'll be careful.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Adachi.png"/> Huh…? Someone told you already?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> It was three guys… They were wearing uniforms, so I think they were high school students…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> Did one of them happen to look… How do I put it… Did he look something like a gang member?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Adachi.png"/> Wait… You think she's talking about your nephew and his friends?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> ……<br/>
Something smells here.<br/>
The recent disappearances… Between those and the two homicides, there's too many questions with no answers.<br/>
To tell the truth, I followed my detective's intuition and came here to warn her.<br/>
How could high school kids who know less than we do beat us to the punch…?<br/>
Were they just making up an excuse to talk to a famous celebrity…?<br/>
Or…<br/>
……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Adachi.png"/> Sir…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> Yasogami High…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00171.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Adachi.png"/> I guess the investigation of the ones involved with the school hasn't turned up anything either…<br/>
Aren't we gonna be in trouble if this keeps up? The prefectural police will be coming soon to-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> They're the least of your worries! Keep your head in the game.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dojima was sort of on edge, I was concerned he'd caught on to why we were at Marukyu.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00175.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> Yeah… It tastes great.<br/>
You visited Rise Kujikawa today. What did you talk about?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided to just admit what we were there for, he might be pissed but at least he wouldn't think I was hiding something.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00178.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> I told you to keep your hands off this.<br/>
Listen, this is a job for the police.<br/>
*sigh * Forget it… I shouldn't have brought it up.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Nanako.png"/> You guys met Rise-chan!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> *sigh * Yeah…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Nanako.png"/> Are you… fighting again?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Dojima.png"/> Of course not… Here, hurry and finish your dinner.<br/>
&gt; The tense atmosphere continues into the night…<br/>
<br/>
<i>The Midnight Channel was back on, and it was definitely Rise this time.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00189.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It's the same girl as before, still wearing a swimsuit. Her chest area and waist are emphasized…<br/>
&gt; This girl…<br/>
&gt; It's Rise Kujikawa! The image is fairly clear tonight.<br/>
&gt; Should you try calling Yosuke…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I figured Yosuke would call me if I didn't call him.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00195.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> The one on tonight seemed a lot creepier than the real Rise, but you could see her face clearly. There's no mistake.<br/>
Let's all get together as soon as possible tomorrow!<br/>
&gt; You hung up.<br/>
&gt; You decide to go to bed for tonight.<br/>
<br/>
<i>At least it was still fuzzy, she's not been kidnapped yet.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>6/23/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>We got together at Junes after school.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>VIDEO- "The Plan"</b><br/>
<a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/SAFeinne/videos/923/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00200.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> It even showed her face this time.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> So now we know one more thing. The ones that the culprit's targeting are…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Souji.png"/> Broadcasted on TV.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Exactly! So we can rules out the assumption that all the victims are connected to the incident with Ms. Yamano.<br/>
As for Rise, I took a peek this morning, and she was still at the shop.<br/>
So I'm guessing that "TV show" thing doesn't appear on the Midnight Channel until after the person enters the TV.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> Teddie said before that it might be the victim's own creation upon entering that world.<br/>
I didn't understand at all at first, but now I feel it may be true.<br/>
The one that appears on TV is your other self… Maybe the victim's true feelings are shown unconsciously.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> But… We see them on the Midnight Channel before they disappear.<br/>
You know, when it's still really fuzzy and you can't tell who it is. How do you explain that part?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah… It always happens before the person disappears, like an advance notice…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Or like a ransom note. But who are they announcing it to? And for what?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> I dunno, ask the killer. There's a bunch of stuff I still don't understand.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> Is it possible that we see those images for the same reason?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Huh? What do you mean?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukiko had a really interesting theory.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00217.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> Maybe what we're seeing is the culprit's intentions.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Well, it's a possibility…<br/>
The killer can throw people into the TV, after all, which means they must have the same power that we do.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> So… When the killer things, "I'm gonna attack someone now," that's what we see on TV?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> I don't know about that…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Well, if we're gonna go that far with it, we might as well say that's the basis for that entire world.<br/>
Like, it's some kinda mix of the minds of the victims and the killer… Or maybe it's everyone's minds?<br/>
<br/>
<i>And I think Yosuke's really onto something.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00225.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> *sigh * As always, nothing makes sense.<br/>
Hey Kanji-kun, you still with us? You haven't said a word yet.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Whaa…? Uhh… Well, um…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> You weren't sleeping, were you…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> O-Of course not! I was uh, lost in thought.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> *sigh * I wish I knew what that world's all about.<br/>
Teddie's explanations have so many "maybe"s in them that I don't understand the first thing about it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> Why would the culprit throw people inside the TV in the first place?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> They must know by now that people die when they're in there long enough… There's no doubt it's attempted murder.<br/>
So the TV's a good way to do that, because the police can never prove anything about the crime.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Murder, huh…? So the killer's got a grudge against certain people?<br/>
Well, there's a shitload of people who've got my number.<br/>
How 'bout you, Yukiko-senpai? Anyone hate you so bad they'd get rid of you forever?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> No.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Uh, Yukiko… There's always a slight chance and you just don't realize it… Haha.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie's been getting better at this actually.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00241.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Well, the good thing is, we have another shot at getting ahead of the killer. We can leave the motive aside for now.<br/>
Once we catch 'em, we'll make 'em talk.<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of now is that Rise is in danger.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Wait… We get to do another stakeout!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Hell yeah! This time we'll catch 'em in the act!<br/>
<br/>
<i>So we started another stakeout. We stopped by Shiroku first.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> You said it. There's no better meal than that for a man on a stakeout.<br/>
Oh, and throw in some disposable diapers.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> For what!? They don't even sell those here!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> We have 'em at Junes.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Too much information!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> You guys finished yet? Let's hurry up and get going.<br/>
<br/>
<i>That detective came in, I kinda think he was following us.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00254.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Adachi.png"/> Oh, uh… Well… I'm doing legwork.<br/>
Ugh, what did I do to deserve babysitting detail…?<br/>
I-I mean, it's nothing major. It's not like Dojima-san ordered me here.<br/>
So what are you kids up to? Buying snacks?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> We were just about to head over to the tofu shop to see Rise-chan.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Adachi.png"/> Oh… I see.<br/>
H-Heyyy! I'm on my way there too!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Oh, then why don't we go there together?<br/>
C'mon, he's a detective on active duty. Not a bad guy to have around!<br/>
<br/>
<i>And so the stakeout began.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00264.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Don't stop! The culprit might get suspicious!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> But we've walked past here like a thousand times already…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Adachi.png"/> Come on out, you bastard…! We're ready for you…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> Oh… Look!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Some freak was up on a pole outside Rise's place.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-P4-00270.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Hey, he's running away!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Get back here!<br/>
Stop running, dammit!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We cornered him at the gas station.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-P4-00274.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Shaddup! What kinda idiot would listen to-<br/>
<b>Suspicious Man:</b> I-I'll do it, you know! What're you gonna do if I get run over!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Wh-What…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Adachi.png"/> N-No!<br/>
If the suspect gets injured, the police will be held responsible… They'll get really angry, and…<br/>
…Um.<br/>
<b>Suspicious Man:</b> I'll do it, I swear! S-So get outta here and stop chasing me!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> H-Hey, what should we do?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Okay so I wasn't so great under pressure here.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-P4-00283.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> How are we supposed to get behind him…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> C'mon… let's just take him down.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> All right, on my mark…<br/>
Look over there! A Martian!<br/>
<b>Suspicious Man:</b> Ack!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We managed to take the bastard down.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-P4-00289.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Shut the hell up, murderer! We're taking your punk ass in!<br/>
<b>Suspicious Man:</b> Wha--!? Time out! What do you mean, "murderer"!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> It's no use playing dumb!<br/>
<b>Suspicious Man:</b> W-Wait a second!<br/>
I just really like Risette, so I wanted to take a peek in her room…<br/>
Look, see! All I've got on me is a bunch of cameras!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Adachi.png"/> Yep, you're the culprit, all right. No two ways about it.<br/>
All right, I'll take it from here.<br/>
We'll hear your story down at the station… Ohh, how I've waited to use that line!<br/>
<b>Suspicious Man:</b> P-Please! Let me go! I didn't do anything wrong!<br/>
I-I know for a fact it's not a crime in this country to take secret pictures!<br/>
<br/>
<i>He sure seemed convinced this was the killer.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-P4-00301.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Adachi.png"/> Come with me! We'll talk about this later!<br/>
Wow, that went better than I thought! What a coup!<br/>
I gotta thank you guys for all your help! Well done!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Oh… sure!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Adachi.png"/> But you really should stop getting involved with this stuff. It's dangerous. I know Dojima-san was worried sick.<br/>
C'mon, let's go!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Is it… really over?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Rest is up to the cops…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Looks like the killer was a pervert, just like we thought.<br/>
Wait… Does this mean the case is closed? Seriously!?<br/>
Awesome!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We decided to drop in on Rise and give her the good news.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-P4-00313.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Rise's Grandmother:</b> Oh, hello. Would you like some tofu?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, h-hello. Umm…<br/>
<b>Rise's Grandmother:</b> Oh, did you come to see Rise? She seems to have gone out, unfortunately…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Huh? But wasn't she just here?<br/>
<b>Rise's Grandmother:</b> She does that sometimes. She'll just wander out without a word…<br/>
You must forgive her. She's quite worn out, in many ways.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> She left… without saying anything?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Adachi.png"/> C'mon, you worry too much! She must've just stepped out.<br/>
I mean, we caught the guy.<br/>
<b>Suspicious Man:</b> Wh-What are you talking about…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Adachi.png"/> We'll discuss it later.<br/>
If you'll excuse me, I've gotta take this guy in for questioning.<br/>
Man, I can't wait to see the look on Dojima-san's face!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> She left without saying anything…? Could that mean…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Shouldn't we look for her!? She can't have gone far.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Y-Yeah, I agree!<br/>
<br/>
<i>But Rise was nowhere to be found.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-P4-00330.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> None of the neighbors have seen her…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Maybe we're just not looking in the right places… But where could she have gone?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Dammit, this can't be good. I hope I'm wrong…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Well, we did everything we can. No use griping about it.<br/>
The weatherman says it's gonna rain tonight, so let's just keep our fingers crossed and tune in.<br/>
&gt; You should make certain to watch the Midnight Channel tonight…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And that night our worst fears were realized once more.</i><br/>

<br/>
&gt; It's an extremely vivid image!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Shadow_Rise.png"/> "Maru-Q! Push Risette!" Good evening, good evening! I'm Rise Kujikawa!<br/>
This spring, one young girl levels up to become a high school idol… Yayyy!<br/>
So today, I'm gonna celebrate by pushing the limits of Standards &amp; Practices!<br/>
Does everybody know what time it is? Showtime!<br/>
Show what, huh? Hmhmhm… E-very-thing!<br/>
Eee, how embarrassing! Is this too hot for TV!?<br/>
Well, if a thing is worth doing, it's worth doing all the way! I'm gonna bare it all for you!<br/>
Heehee! Stay tuned!<br/>
&gt; It was definitely Rise you saw…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And HOLY SHIT.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-P4-00351.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> I-Is she serious about baring it all!?<br/>
Is it me, or all these shows getting crazier and crazier!?<br/>
&gt; Yosuke sounds excited.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Souji.png"/> Let's rescue her quick.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Y-Yeah, exactly.<br/>
'Cause I bet her Shadow self is gonna do whatever it wants again.<br/>
But man… We couldn't prevent the kidnapping this time either… even when we knew who the target would be.<br/>
That detective from this afternoon was no help at all. I guess we'll have to do everything ourselves…<br/>
A-Anyways, see you tomorrow!<br/>
&gt; …You decide to go to bed early.<br/>
<br/>
