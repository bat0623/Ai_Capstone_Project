<br/>

<br/>
&gt; It seems Yukiko has some free time…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> Okay.<br/>
&gt; Yukiko looks happy.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Yukiko brought you here, saying she wanted pay her respects.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> Are you going to wish for something, Souji-kun?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> For you…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> M-Me…?<br/>
…Thank you.<br/>
&gt; Yukiko looks embarrassed…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> I'm wishing for everyone's health.<br/>
For Chie, for you, for the others… And everyone at the inn, too.<br/>
And…<br/>
I'm wishing to become a woman worthy of you… Souji-kun.<br/>
Finally, I wish for everyone to be able to smile together…<br/>
…Let's begin our prayer.<br/>
I've decided not to leave Inaba.<br/>
I never really objected to being the inn's manager per se…<br/>
I just didn't like the fact that it wasn't up to me… I felt that my life was on rails.<br/>
And I thought running away was the only choice for me…<br/>
But no longer. I want to protect the family inn.<br/>
After all, it's near to my heart…<br/>
…Thank you, Souji-kun. I think it's because of you that I realized this.<br/>
Because you were always by my side…<br/>
&gt; Yukiko is smiling gently…<br/>
&gt; Yukiko's determination makes her look more mature…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> U-Umm, I wanted to ask you this before…<br/>
……<br/>
Wh-Why…<br/>
Why are you always with me…?<br/>
I-Is it okay… for me to ask…?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> Y… You like…?<br/>
M-Me…?<br/>
……<br/>
Uh, ummm…<br/>
I-I feel the same way… so…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; There's no turning back…<br/>
&gt; Your relationship with Yukiko has become intimate.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> I thought my heart was going to stop…<br/>
Umm…<br/>
Stay here with me… just a little longer…<br/>
&gt; You spent a long while with Yukiko…<br/>
&gt; You walked her to the inn and went home.<br/>
<br/>
And the alternate max rank event.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> Haha… I feel kind of embarrassed. D-Do you want to go somewhere?<br/>
&gt; It seems Yukiko isn't busy right now…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> O-Okay. Thank goodness…<br/>
U-Umm!<br/>
Well… If it's okay with you, umm…<br/>
……<br/>
I-i want to go to… your room.<br/>
&gt; Yukiko looks embarrassed…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You invited Yukiko here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> So this is your room…<br/>
……<br/>
Oh, s-sorry! I didn't mean to look around…<br/>
It's just that this is the first time I've been to a boy's room…<br/>
Oh, you sleep on a futon, I see. I use a futon, too…<br/>
……<br/>
Umm, sorry… I don't know what to talk about…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> Huh…?<br/>
Oh, y-y-you mean to sit? Anywhere's fine…<br/>
……<br/>
I-I'm… fine with anything…<br/>
You don't need to worry about me…<br/>
&gt; You decided to relax with Yukiko…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> I don't plan to leave anymore, but I thought I might as well.<br/>
I'm glad I realized sooner…<br/>
If I'd struck out on my own, I know I would have regretted it.<br/>
I wanted to become completely self-sufficient.<br/>
But I think I was being presumptuous.<br/>
I have the inn, I have my family, I have the waitresses and chefs…<br/>
I am who I am now because I was raised by such a kind group…<br/>
When I think of it that way, my problems aren't just my own.<br/>
That's why… I'm going to stay here. By my own will.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> That's good.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00085.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00086.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Konohana Sakuya has transfigured into Amaterasu!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> This is… my new power…?<br/>
The power you've shown to me…<br/>
…Power I will treasure.<br/>
I want you to have this.<br/>
&gt; You obtained Shrine Charm.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> It's a charm from that shrine… To protect you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> You'll protect me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> I want to, but…<br/>
&gt; Yukiko is smiling sadly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> I'm staying here…<br/>
This charm will protect you in my place…<br/>
Then… we'll always be together…<br/>
&gt; Yukiko's voice is trembling…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> Souji-kun…<br/>
……<br/>
I love you…<br/>
&gt; You can feel Yukiko's pure and simple love…<br/>
&gt; You feel a strong bond between you and Yukiko…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00106.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00107.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yukiko.png"/> U-Umm…<br/>
……<br/>
Sh-Sheesh… Don't stare so much at me…<br/>
Can I say it again…?<br/>
Souji-kun…<br/>
…I love you.<br/>
&gt; You passed a long while with Yukiko.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; it has gotten dark, so you walked Yukiko to her house…
