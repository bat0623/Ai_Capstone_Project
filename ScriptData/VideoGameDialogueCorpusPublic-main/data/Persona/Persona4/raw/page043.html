<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Now, about what happened last night… You guys saw it, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kanji.png"/> Yeah. Shit he said made my blood boil.<br/>
That mumbling of his and those fish-like eyes pissed me off even more.<br/>
Who the hell is he?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I said what I think we were all thinking.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> You too, Yosuke-kun?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> It's just a hunch, but it makes sense.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> We've been told the suspect is a high schooler… The police are after him for the murder of King Moron.<br/>
So to see that on TV last night, at a time like this…<br/>
I mean, he even taunted the viewers, saying, "Try and catch me…"<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kanji.png"/> Uhhhh… So?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Alright, let's say there's this high school student. We'll call him Shin.<br/>
For some random reason, who knows why, Shin is able to enter the other world.<br/>
Then Shin, again for some random reason, starts throwing people into that world, intending to kill them.<br/>
The police can't prove the other world exists, so it's the perfect crime. He can't possibly be caught.<br/>
Now imagine you're Shin, but after a while, people stop dying when you throw them in the TV. You don't know why.<br/>
You want to kill King Moron, but the TV is out, so you have to do it personally. Now the police are on to you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> As a result, you-I mean Shin-is a wanted criminal, and there's no place for him to run.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kanji.png"/> So… you're saying he went into the other world to dodge the cops?<br/>
Ohhhh… So that's why he said, "Catch me if you can…" Wow Senpai, you're smarter than you look!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Geez, you can piss me off sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think Yosuke's on to something.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> But if he had a personal grudge against Mr. Morooka, that explains one thing.<br/>
With a strong enough motive, wouldn't he forsake the untraceable TV method and try to kill Mr. Morooka on his own?<br/>
If you think about it that way, it sort of makes sense why Mr. Morooka died without appearing on TV.<br/>
But I wonder what that boy's going to do, now that he's in there…<br/>
With Teddie on this side, there's no way for him to get out…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Y-You don't think… he's gonna get desperate and end it all…?<br/>
He did look depressed, like it was the end of the world…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> No, I don't think that's it.<br/>
The killer has to know that the people he threw into the TV have come back to this side.<br/>
I can see missing Yukiko or Kanji. But Rise, a celebrity… There's no way the killer wouldn't know she's still alive.<br/>
So that means he knows there's a way out of the TV world.<br/>
As for the rest… We'll just have to ask him face to face.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Rise returned just then, but the news wasn't so good.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Rise.png"/> Not good. There's not enough information to go on.<br/>
But at least we're positive that someone's in there…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I see… Wait, where's Teddie?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Rise.png"/> He's still looking.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Alright. So we need to find out who that guy is…<br/>
…and if he is in fact the one the police are after.<br/>
Once we figure that out, we just do our thing.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> That's right!<br/>
If he really is the killer and he's escaped into the other world, the police don't have a chance of catching him.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kanji.png"/> So it's all on us!<br/>
&gt; Everyone's heart was united by the desire to solve the case!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still, we've got to do what we can.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Well then, let's get digging!<br/>
&gt; It seems you'll need more information on that boy to make any progress.<br/>
&gt; You should ask around about him…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We didn't have much to go on unfortunately.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> We don't know anything about that boy… Not even his name. This is hard…<br/>
Well, I'll try my best and get as much information as possible.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kanji did have a good idea, though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kanji.png"/> It's pretty tough… Seems like no one knows anything, huh?<br/>
But instead of bitchin' about it, why don't we go right to the source?<br/>
Just ask Dojima-san. He's your uncle, right? He'd tell you something.<br/>
&gt; Maybe Kanji's suggestion is right…<br/>
&gt; But you wonder if Dojima will say anything…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was worth a try of course.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Dojima.png"/> You… I told you not to stick your neck into things! There's no way I'd tell you!<br/>
Geez… Damn, where did that Adachi go off to…?<br/>
&gt; You can't seem to get anything out of him…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Shouldn't have expected anything different.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Ah… Well, can't help it if he gets mad.<br/>
I guess all we can do is look for someone who can tell us a little more.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> O-Of course I'm perfectly capable of gathering intel while I'm eating!<br/>
Mmm… But it seems like most people don't know anything about the incident.<br/>
How about… the police?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think I know who we need to talk to, but he's nowhere to be found. I ended up having to kill the rest of the day, and I decided to head to the hospital again when I got home.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00093.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You busily cleaned the recently vacated hospital room…<br/>
&gt; ……!?<br/>
&gt; You thought you heard a woman's scream coming from somewhere…<br/>
&gt; You decided to pretend not to notice and continue cleaning…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I found out what had been going on soon enough.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Sayoko looks like she's in a bad mood…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Sayoko.png"/> …Did you hear that commotion?<br/>
That was the first time anyone ever called me a "slutty bitch" to my face…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Souji.png"/> It's like a soap opera.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Sayoko.png"/> Seriously.<br/>
When I laughed at her feeble attempt at an insult, she scratched at me. Who's the bitch now…?<br/>
&gt; Sayoko smiles wryly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Sayoko.png"/> At the previous hospital I worked at… I had a relationship with one of the doctors.<br/>
But… he had a wife.<br/>
She found out, I was forced to quit… and I started working here.<br/>
Not too long after, it seems he began flirting again, this time with a different nurse at the hospital.<br/>
I don't know what happened, but I got dragged back into it. His wife came all the way here to bitch at me.<br/>
*sigh * The other nurses were just watching, with these stupid smirks on their faces.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Not sure what she was expecting.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00113.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Sayoko.png"/> Haha… You're right. I'd probably do the same, in their place…<br/>
Strangers are strangers…<br/>
&gt; Sayoko smiles wryly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Sayoko.png"/> *sigh * Everything's just a pain.<br/>
It wasn't like this at first… when I first thought about becoming a nurse.<br/>
What am I working for…?<br/>
What am I living for…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I tried to cheer her up.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00121.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Sayoko.png"/> Oh… I'm sorry, I was just grumbling to myself.<br/>
You're pretty bold, for a kid.<br/>
&gt; Sayoko smiles…<br/>
&gt; You feel you understand Sayoko more now…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I guess I succeeded.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00126.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Sayoko.png"/> I'd better go. I'm sure that bitch is gone by now.<br/>
Be careful going home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I just hope we can find Adachi tomorrow.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>7/28/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>We did indeed find Adachi today. He was much more helpful than Dojima.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00134.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Adachi.png"/> Mm? Aaah! You startled me… Don't sneak up on me like that…!<br/>
Eh? What was I doing? Oh, uh, you know… Investigating…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Souji.png"/> I'll tell Dojima.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Adachi.png"/> D-Did Dojima-san maybe say anything about it?<br/>
Just keep this a secret from him… Please!<br/>
…Wait, what? Clues to catch the suspect?<br/>
If I tell you, will you keep quiet!? Okay then… I'm just talking to myself here, but…<br/>
He supposedly had a part-time job in the shopping district.<br/>
Where was it? Oh… I don't think they told me that much.<br/>
&gt; It seems that Adachi has purposely leaked some information.<br/>
&gt; Where exactly did the suspicious boy work…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Now we just had to figure out where this dude worked.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00146.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yukiko.png"/> They were talking as if it was some kind of joke. It really made me angry…<br/>
The culprit worked part-time at one of the stores around here, right?<br/>
It may be in this shopping district… Well, we need to redouble our search and keep asking around!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I figured Rise's grandmother might know something.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00150.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Rise's Grandmother:</b> Rise is not home yet.<br/>
&gt; You asked her if a student was working part-time here.<br/>
<b>Rise's Grandmother:</b> A student? No, I am the only one who has been working here this entire time.<br/>
Thank goodness Rise has come back. She's been very helpful.<br/>
&gt; It appears that the student you're looking for didn't work here…<br/>
<br/>
<i>However, down the block I had some better luck.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00156.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You asked if a student was working here part-time.<br/>
<b>Lady:</b> Wh-Where'd you hear that from? I told him not to tell anyone…<br/>
…Anyway. Yes, he did work here for a short time.<br/>
But this was a while ago. He freaked out just from cutting the raw meat.<br/>
Hmm… I remember he had black eyes.<br/>
And what else…<br/>
…Oh yeah. He said the person who worked here before him was his classmate during  middle school…<br/>
I see that kid-his classmate-around here sometimes. Maybe you should talk to him when you see him.<br/>
I don't know if you'll find him today, but he recently dyed his hair golden brown, so he should be easy to spot.<br/>
&gt; You've obtained a lead about the boy.<br/>
&gt; If you can find his golden brown-haired classmate, you'll probably obtain information about the boy…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sure enough, he wasn't around. I hate having to just kill time, but if he's not around there's nothing I can do.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>7/29/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Hoo boy. Where to start? I found the kid with the brown hair earlier.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00171.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Student:</b> You wanna see his picture?<br/>
Heh heh, you do, don't you?<br/>
Well, today's your lucky day, because me and my friends are going around showing it to everyone! Want a copy?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sure enough that was him.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00175.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; There is no doubt that the boy in the picture is the one you saw on the Midnight Channel…<br/>
&gt; A name is written below the picture…<br/>
&gt; "Mitsuo Kubo"…<br/>
&gt; So this is the suspicious boy's name…<br/>
&gt; You should report to Rise.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We returned to the TV world. We didn't know then that our greatest test was waiting for us.</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>To be continued…</i><br/>
