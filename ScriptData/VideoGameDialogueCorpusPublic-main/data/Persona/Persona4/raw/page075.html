			<b>10/25/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>I saw Naoto at lunch.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Ah, yes… There haven't been any further developments regarding the card.<br/>
I suspect that it is mostly a prank in poor taste. I apologize for troubling you with it.<br/>
&gt; Naoto seems calm, but…<br/>
&gt; Maybe you should walk her home after school…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was sort of worried to be quite honest.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> …Ah, yes. Do you have time you can spare with me today?<br/>
&gt; Naoto has asked you out…<br/>
&gt; …Come to think of it, someone had sent Naoto a mysterious card.<br/>
&gt; Maybe it would be best if you walked her home…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Oh, n-no, I'll be fine by myself!<br/>
<br/>
<i>But yeah I wasn't going to take any arguing when someone's safety is at stake.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Umm, well… If you don't mind…<br/>
&gt; Naoto seems a bit relieved, despite her protests…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Naoto found something in her locker as we got ready to leave.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> This was in my shoe locker.<br/>
&gt; Naoto is holding a sealed letter…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Souji.png"/> That card business again…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> I thought so too, at first… But it seems that's not the case.<br/>
This time, the sender's name is clearly written…<br/>
&gt; Naoto is looking at the letter intently.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Judging by the name and the handwriting, the sender is a woman. She thoughtfully provided her year and class.<br/>
When one factors in the heart-shaped seal as well, it's hard to imagine that this is related to my job in any way.<br/>
In other words… there is no need to read it.<br/>
*sigh * I apologize. I wasted your time with this pointlessness.<br/>
How misleading… A sealed letter at a time like this…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Naoto sure didn't seem happy about it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> I cannot dispose of it on school premises, of couse…<br/>
I'll take it home and feed it to the shredder.<br/>
&gt; Naoto's words are blunt…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Whether the sender is male or female, I have no intention of responding.<br/>
I have no time to be dilly-dallying with callow love affairs… I assume the same is true for you?<br/>
Saying they love me without even knowing me… Ludicrous.<br/>
…Let's go.<br/>
Would you like to stop somewhere on the way? There are still some questions I have regarding the murders.<br/>
&gt; Naoto is taking the case seriously…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Naoto has grown deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Naoto might be right, we've got way too much going on right now for something like that. Certainly makes me feel better about… certain past events.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Then, shall we be off?<br/>
&gt; You talked with Naoto about the murders…<br/>
&gt; You walked Naoto to her house and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still, I have fun when we get together and talk about the case.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>10/26/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I think Yukiko is looking forward to this group date thing.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> The Culture Festival is just around the corner.<br/>
Let's all do our best to prepare for it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Souji.png"/> Okay.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> Our class was late on deciding what to do, and Ms. Kashiwagi has been very busy, right?<br/>
So, we need to pick up the slack and make sure we do a good job.<br/>
……<br/>
…Oh! I'm not interested in the "blind date" part! Understand!?<br/>
I-I'm not, okay!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>They're not letting up on us in class, either.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Ms. Sofue:</b> I'm sure you all know the eight-legged sea creature, the octopus, right?<br/>
"Oct" means "eight" in Latin. Then why is October the 10th month of the year?<br/>
Some say that a Roman emperor added a month to the calendar by naming his birth month after him.<br/>
Don't you think emperors are frightening figures sometimes? Although, they're the ones who've defined history to this day.<br/>
Let's get back to the lecture. I'll discuss the beginning of the Reconquista…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Naoto and I went down to the bookstore in the shopping district for a while after school, and after that I headed down to the hospital to work for a bit. I didn't see Sayoko around, and I found out why pretty quickly.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00094.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Middle-Aged Nurse:</b> We're going to be needing this room, so can you get all your cleaning supplies out of here?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Souji.png"/> Is there an emergency?<br/>
<b>Middle-Aged Nurse:</b> Uehara-san… One of the nurses just collapsed.<br/>
She needs to rest, but the doctors on break are using the lounge, so…<br/>
She seems overworked… Er, don't tell anyone I said that, okay? I'd rather not get hauled in for a review.<br/>
…Here, help me.<br/>
&gt; A nurse laid Sayoko down on the bed and injected her with a syringe…<br/>
<br/>
<i>She's really working way too hard.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00102.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Sayoko.png"/> I was just a little wobbly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Souji.png"/> Overworking, I hear?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Sayoko.png"/> They're trying to get rid of me. I'm always pressuring them to do their jobs.<br/>
*sigh * I'm lucky they didn't tie me down with an IV. I'm all right now…<br/>
I'll be going.<br/>
&gt; It seems Sayoko is still set on continuing to work.<br/>
&gt; What should you do…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Souji.png"/> Don't do it all yourself.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Sayoko.png"/> Wh-What? Why are you acting so high and mighty…?<br/>
……<br/>
I mean…<br/>
I might be able to save someone's life.<br/>
I need to do what I can. I can't spend time worrying about myself.<br/>
Otherwise… I'd never be able to face him again…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't think he'd want her to kill herself, though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00119.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Sayoko.png"/> O-Of course he would…<br/>
Wouldn't he…?<br/>
……<br/>
Oh… I see. I…<br/>
I was doing it for myself…<br/>
I wanted to escape the pain…<br/>
I was working hard, to avoid feeling anything at all…<br/>
I see that now…<br/>
Haha… I'm so stupid.<br/>
&gt; Sayoko seems to be holding back tears…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Sayoko.png"/> I get it… Yeah, I get it…<br/>
Thank you…<br/>
&gt; Sayoko tries to smile…<br/>
&gt; You feel that you were able to give Sayoko some support…<br/>
<br/>
<i>After all, she can't help anyone if she dies.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00134.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Sayoko.png"/> …I'm going to rest for a little while longer. You can go now.<br/>
Don't look at me…<br/>
&gt; You left Sayoko and went home…<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>Yosuke had an… unusual amount of spring in his step as we walked up to school. I wish I didn't know why now.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, what kind of event did the classes at your old school do during Culture Festivals?<br/>
The school here in Inaba has a bunch of different events for our Culture Festival!<br/>
I guess this is one of the few school events that everybody actually looks forward to.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Souji.png"/> I'm looking forward to it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yosuke.png"/> I know, right? I hope it gets really interesting, especially for some events in particular…<br/>
<br/>
<i>There was a crowd by the bulletin board as I entered.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00144.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; "The Miss Yasogami High Pageant!"<br/>
&gt; …It seems to be announcing a beauty pageant that will take place during the Culture Festival.<br/>
<b>Disinterested Student:</b> Ugh… On top of planning it, Kashiwagi's gonna be in it…?<br/>
<b>Appalled Student:</b> So that's why she agreed to plan this event…<br/>
&gt; The name "Noriko Kashiwagi" is indeed on the entry list…<br/>
&gt; The other contestants are…<br/>
&gt; You see a list of familiar names!<br/>
&gt; "Yukiko Amagi"<br/>
&gt; "Chie Satonaka"<br/>
&gt; "Rise Kujikawa"<br/>
&gt; "Naoto Shirogane"<br/>
&gt; "Hanako Ohtani"<br/>
&gt; It's a surprising lineup…<br/>
<b>Disinterested Student:</b> One, two… Wow, there's a lot of signups here. I'm surprised so many people took an interest.<br/>
<b>Appalled Student:</b> Whoa, Rise Kujikawa!? Seriously? Oh man, trust a celebrity to kill the fun of it all…<br/>
<b>Disinterested Student:</b> I bet she'll draw a huge crowd.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I already had a sinking feeling about this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00161.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Yukiko Fan:</b> If this was any other year, she'd win for sure… now she's up against Risette!<br/>
It's gonna be a Culture Festival to remember…<br/>
<b>Rise Fan:</b> Huh? Risette's entering!? She's gonna take part in something like this!?<br/>
Maybe I better think more seriously about saving a seat…<br/>
<b>Chie Fan:</b> Look, Chie's entering too. She's actually pretty close to my type.<br/>
<b>Yukiko Fan:</b> Actually, I hear she has a lot of secret admirers.<br/>
Naoto's that boyish… girlish… whatever, right? You know, she's, uh… pretty cute, hehehe.<br/>
<b>Glasses-Wearing Student:</b> Dude, you sound like a pervo when you laugh like that…<br/>
B-But, to be honest… I think she's cute, too… Hehehe.<br/>
&gt; It seems that each girl already has fans…<br/>
<br/>
<i>At that point Yosuke came suspiciously by.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00172.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yosuke.png"/> Are you free for lunch? I dunno why, but Chie asked us to come to the roof.<br/>
She looked pretty serious… I wonder if something's happened.<br/>
Oh, and Kanji's coming, too.<br/>
&gt; You were called out to the rooftop during lunch.<br/>
&gt; Did something happen…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yeah I thought that list had familiar handwriting.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00178.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yosuke.png"/> F-For what?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Chie.png"/> The beauty pageant! You wrote down our names without telling us, didn't you!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yosuke.png"/> N-No! It wasn't me! Why do you automatically blame me!?<br/>
I-I mean, if you don't wanna do it, you just say no, right? Like it was just a joke.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Chie.png"/> We wouldn't be so pissed if we could do that!<br/>
With Kashiwagi planning this year's event, even those who got entered by other people can't back out!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yosuke.png"/> Seriously? Must've been something in the fine print I overlooked…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Chie.png"/> So it was you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yosuke.png"/> Oh crap…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Rise.png"/> Hey… Do you want us to take part in the beauty pageant?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yosuke.png"/> W-Well yeah.<br/>
I mean, you guys know how popular Yukiko is here. And on top of that, we have an idol and a Detective Prince.<br/>
What's the point of having a beauty pageant if all these incredible heroines aren't going to take part!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Chie.png"/> So where do I fit in!?<br/>
……<br/>
Well, excuuuse me for not fitting in!!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, you want them to be in it too, don'tcha, Kanji!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> Huh…? I ain't interested in that stuff…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yosuke.png"/> Naoto-kun… Kanji-kun says that he really wants you to be in it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> Wha--!? I-I didn't say nothing!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yosuke.png"/> What about you? You want them to be in it, right?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dammit, Yosuke's the king of these prick questions where there's no good answer. He's my bro, so I'll back him up, but I have a sinking feeling there's going to be some kind of retribution for this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00200.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Rise.png"/> Ahh…<br/>
I thought you might be a little jealous, not wanting me to show off to other guys. But I guess you're not that uptight.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Chie.png"/> Hey… You guys are inching onto the bandwagon with Yosuke, aren't you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Rise.png"/> So long as there are people looking forward to seeing me, I might as well put on a show for 'em.<br/>
Of course, there's no need to involve my agency in this.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yosuke.png"/> Th-That's right! That's the way to go! Teddie's looking forward to it too.<br/>
Actually, I think he was more excited than anyone. It was him who was pushing me to sign you all up.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Chie.png"/> Ugh, so Ted's behind this too…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> We're in an awkward position… If we can't refuse, I suppose there's no sense in arguing the point…<br/>
But it seems ill-fitting for someone like me to get up on stage…<br/>
I wonder if there's any way I could take it up with the school authorities…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> I-I… don't think it's a problem at all.<br/>
I-I mean, just do it! Ya know… Seriously!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yosuke.png"/> Dude… Looks like your blood's boiling even more than usual…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kanji is really bad at talking to girls. I mean, like, scary bad.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00215.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Rise.png"/> So, is it a deal? The four of us will be in the beauty pageant?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Wh-What are you saying!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> Um… I beg you, please be in it.<br/>
If you do, my, uh, doubts will finally be cleared…<br/>
C'mon! Make me a man!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Doubts…? What are you talking about?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> L-Look, just do it, dammit! I m-mean, you're an ace detective, aren't ya!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Wha--!? What does that have to do with a beauty pageant!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> *gasp * *gasp *<br/>
<br/>
<i>Anyway, after school we spent some time working on this group date café thing.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00226.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yosuke.png"/> Where'd you guys go?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Chie.png"/> Over to Junes. We had to go get some paint and cloth.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yosuke.png"/> Ohh, for the decorations.<br/>
<b>Female Class Rep:</b> Thank you. Did you have them write you an invoice?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Chie.png"/> Yeah, I think they understood what it was for, so they wrote it without us having to ask.<br/>
<b>Male Class Rep:</b> There's some things I want to go over about the day of the event.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Chie.png"/> Is this about the group date café…?<br/>
<b>Male Class Rep:</b> Yes, since Yosuke's leading the executive committee.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yosuke.png"/> Wait, what!?<br/>
<b>Male Class Rep:</b> It was your proposal, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yosuke.png"/> Are you serious…?<br/>
<b>Male Class Rep:</b> Well, all you have to do is the reception.<br/>
After people sign in, have a few guys and girls sit facing each other at a table…<br/>
Conduct a short session first where they ask each other questions.<br/>
After about half an hour of that, it'll be confession time. Get them to select the number of the person they like.<br/>
If the other person accepts, that makes them a couple… Hey Yosuke, you listening?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke's not terribly focused.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00243.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Slacker Student:</b> Hey, if we roll up this bit of cloth, won't it be kinda like a ball?<br/>
<b>Follower Student:</b> Yeah! Okay, I'll be the catcher!<br/>
<b>Enthusiastic Student:</b> Why the catcher…?<br/>
Hey, Yosuke! Wanna be the batter?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yosuke.png"/> *sigh *<br/>
Ahh, I don't give a damn anymore! I'm in! Watch me slam that ball right back in your face!<br/>
<b>Female Class Rep:</b> Hey! You guys better get serious about this!<br/>
&gt; The group date café that your class will be running at the Culture Festival is getting underway…<br/>
<br/>
<i>This is going to end so badly. Dojima was finally home, and had something for me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00252.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Dojima.png"/> I heard you got top marks on that last exam.<br/>
Keeping up your studies while taking care of Nanako, too…? You're one hard working, aren't you?<br/>
I need to act like an uncle every so often and give you some spending money.<br/>
Here you go… A big tip.<br/>
But don't spend it all in… Nah, you can use it however you like.<br/>
&gt; You obtained 50000 yen from Dojima.<br/>
