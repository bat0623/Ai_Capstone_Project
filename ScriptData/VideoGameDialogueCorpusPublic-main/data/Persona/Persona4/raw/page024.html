			<b>5/30/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>Kanji's still out, which Morooka can't stop harping on. Douche.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Morooka.png"/> I bet he's out there dicking around all day long! …What? What's with your faces?<br/>
You trying to tell me I shouldn't assume things…? Well if you don't want it to happen to you, keep this in mind!<br/>
Unless you behave well, people are gonna have their doubts!<br/>
Descartes once said…<br/>
"The senses deceive from time to time, and it is prudent never to trust wholly those who have deceived us even once."<br/>
Besides, we don't need society's trash like Tatsumi here. The school would be better off without him!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I went to drama later, Yumi was kind of preoccupied and left right at the end. Not much else to say.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>5/31/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yumi's really doing poorly.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yumi.png"/> No!<br/>
The bell hasn't rung yet!<br/>
You want to quit early? You're slacking off! You need to take this more seriously!<br/>
<b>Vice President:</b> Y-Yumi, you shouldn't work too hard…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yumi.png"/> I feel like I'm the only one who cares about this club! Stop holding us back!<br/>
The reason you never get any lead roles is because you act like that!<br/>
<b>President:</b> Yumi!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yumi.png"/> Oh…<br/>
……<br/>
<b>School PA:</b> It is time to go home. Please, don't forget anything.<br/>
<b>Vice President:</b> L-Look, it's time to go home now, anyway. Let's all just stop for today, all right?<br/>
<b>Club Members:</b> Okay.<br/>
&gt; Yumi stands, silent and unmoving.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yumi.png"/> …Was I wrong when I said that?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean she had a good point but damn was that harsh.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yumi.png"/> Y-Yeah, I'm just doing my best, huh…<br/>
&gt; Yumi nods to herself.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yumi.png"/> I'll… keep practicing. At the riverbed or somewhere…<br/>
…Anywhere but at home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Personally I don't think she should be going off alone at a time like this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yumi.png"/> No… But thanks.<br/>
&gt; Yumi smiles…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yumi.png"/> …There's nobody at my house.<br/>
Mom's been going straight to the hospital after work, to see HIM.<br/>
There's no real point to going home now…<br/>
…When I'm by myself at home, I can't stop thinking about all that stuff.<br/>
The past… Why things turned out the way they did… You know.<br/>
I thought I'd forgotten them…<br/>
Sorry… I've just been whining…<br/>
Just forget about this, okay?<br/>
<br/>
<i>She was pretty clearly uncomfortable about this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yumi.png"/> Thanks. I don't like to show off my bad side…<br/>
&gt; Yumi smiles wryly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yumi.png"/> I have my acting.<br/>
That's how I can keep going. No matter what happens, I will go on!<br/>
Yeah, that's right!<br/>
Thank you, Souji-kun! If I was by myself, I'd have been down in the dumps for a while, I just know it.<br/>
So, um… I'm glad you were here.<br/>
Haha… I hope you'll stick around for a while longer.<br/>
&gt; It seems you were able to help support Yumi…<br/>
&gt; You feel that your relationship with Yumi has deepened slightly…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I hope she'll be okay.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yumi.png"/> I'm going to stop somewhere on my way home and practice some more there.<br/>
I finally got a lead role! I have to make sure I can do it!<br/>
Alright!<br/>
&gt; You left Yumi and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Not much I can do but be there for her I guess.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>6/1/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided to take another job part-time at the Hospital.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Then I went to soccer. Daisuke was kind of dogging it on the field.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Daisuke.png"/> Huh? What do you mean?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kou.png"/> Wow, basketball practice finished before soccer today? It's a miracle!<br/>
<b>Soccer Player:</b> You're running like a fat kid with asthma, and you're letting guys drive right past you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Daisuke.png"/> Don't worry… When I play for real, I'll be fine.<br/>
<b>Soccer Player:</b> Yeah, well, when I play for real, I'm a freakin' juggernaut! Haha.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kou.png"/> You have to play seriously, dude.<br/>
If you're not gonna play for real at practice, why are you playing at all…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Daisuke.png"/> Kou…? What's that supposed to mean?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kou.png"/> You think I don't know?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Daisuke.png"/> ……<br/>
<b>Soccer Player:</b> H-Hey you guys… lighten up…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Daisuke.png"/> Go on, say it, Kou. What do you mean?<br/>
&gt; The air is tense…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kou.png"/> Why don't you ask yourself?<br/>
<br/>
<i>One of the varsity players came by to break things up.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Daisuke.png"/> ……<br/>
<b>Varsity Player:</b> …Daisuke, sprint over to the gym and then give me twenty sets of burpees!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Daisuke.png"/> ……<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> Hey, are you okay?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Daisuke.png"/> …Kinda.<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> Um… maybe next time you're free-<br/>
<b>Varsity Player:</b> Daisuke! You just earned yourself five more sets!<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> S-Sorry. Was that my fault?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Daisuke.png"/> No. I needed the practice anyway.<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> O-Okay. I'll, um, see you later then.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Daisuke's seriously freaking out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kou.png"/> ……<br/>
Souji, we need to talk.<br/>
It's about him…<br/>
I have to do some family stuff today, though. Would next time be okay?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kou knows what's up, but I can understand not wanting to talk about it in front of everyone.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00104.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You promised Kou that you'd listen…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kou.png"/> Thanks…<br/>
&gt; Kou smiles with relief.<br/>
&gt; This seems very important to Kou…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kou.png"/> Daisuke really likes you, man.<br/>
I do too. You're the only guy I can trust to talk about him with.<br/>
&gt; You feel Kou's trust in you…<br/>
&gt; You sense a bond has formed between you, Kou, and Daisuke.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think we're close to some kind of breakthrough.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00113.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kou.png"/> Oh, sorry. I better get going.<br/>
Seeya later.<br/>
&gt; You finished practice and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh, and we went shopping earlier.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00119.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Dojima.png"/> I was thinking of taking Nanako out to Junes…<br/>
You wanna come along?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00123.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You came shopping with Nanako and Dojima.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Nanako.png"/> "Every day's great at your Junes!"<br/>
&gt; Nanako is enjoying herself…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Nanako.png"/> Did you want something, big bro?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Dojima.png"/> Go ahead and get whatever you want, but make it quick.<br/>
&gt; You decided to purchase something that caught your eye.<br/>
&gt; …You spy a Royal Jelly.<br/>
&gt; Obtained Royal Jelly x 5.<br/>
&gt; The three of you went home happily…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We should really do that more often. Still no news on Kanji. It's going to start raining tomorrow, too.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>6/2/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yumi didn't make it to drama practice today.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00146.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The lead role Yumi is supposed to play for the concours is being played by the vice president…<br/>
&gt; Did Yumi go to the hospital…?<br/>
&gt; …You decided to visit the hospital after practice ended.<br/>
<br/>
<i>She was at the hospital, sure enough.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00150.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Yumi is sitting here, looking gloomy…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yumi.png"/> Souji-kun… Why are you…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I didn't want to make her feel even worse by saying I was worried.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00153.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yumi.png"/> Your house is in the other direction from school.<br/>
Geez…<br/>
&gt; Yumi looks happier…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yumi.png"/> I'm sorry. You came because I didn't show up to practice, right?<br/>
…Mom collapsed.<br/>
She works from sunup to sundown, and then she comes here to look after him every day…<br/>
The doctor said it was exhaustion. She'll be released from the hospital soon, but…<br/>
She's pushing herself too far. She's so stupid…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Even with the life and death stuff we've gone through, I can't imagine what it would be like to have something happen to a family member.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00162.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yumi.png"/> …It is.<br/>
Nothing matters anymore.<br/>
Now I have to look after Mom, like she looked after him.<br/>
If I don't quit the drama club and get a job, Mom will just make herself sick again working all the time…!<br/>
I'm stepping down from my role!<br/>
The lead role… I had all my lines memorized! My script was full of notes! I'd practiced by myself all this time…<br/>
……<br/>
But there's no point now.<br/>
Nothing goes my way…<br/>
It's all because of my parents. They're both holding me back…<br/>
<br/>
<i>At the same time, though, she should make sure to do what makes her happy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00173.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yumi.png"/> …Thank you…<br/>
…You didn't seem very reliable when we first met, but you know, you're pretty kind after all.<br/>
&gt; Yumi smiles and looks relieved.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yumi.png"/> …I'm sorry for complaining like this.<br/>
It's not like you have anything to do with what's happening in my life.<br/>
<br/>
<i>What I've learned since I got to Inaba is that friends need to stick together.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00179.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yumi.png"/> In for a penny, in for a pound?<br/>
Ha… It's nice to hear you say that, though.<br/>
&gt; Yumi blushes…<br/>
&gt; It seems you were able to support Yumi in a time of need.<br/>
&gt; You feel that your relationship with Yumi has deepened slightly…<br/>
<br/>
<i>What a damn mess this is.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00185.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yumi.png"/> I'm going to visit my mom's room now.<br/>
…I'll see you at school.<br/>
&gt; Yumi walks off sadly. You decided to go home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>While I was at the hospital I picked up some things I'd need for that janitor's position.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00193.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You busily cleaned the dark, silent hallways…<br/>
&gt; ……!?<br/>
&gt; You thought you heard something from down the hall…<br/>
&gt; You decided to pretend not to hear it and continue cleaning…<br/>
<br/>
<i>A doctor and nurse were talking quietly down the hall.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00199.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You can hear bits and pieces of the conversation between the doctor and the nurse…<br/>
<b>Doctor's Whispers:</b> …After patrolling… the empty room…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I couldn't help but hear, and the nurse came up to me after the doctor left.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00202.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Sayoko.png"/> Oho… You're cute. You're the student who started working here today, right?<br/>
I'll show you something fun the next time you're here.<br/>
I'll see you again.<br/>
&gt; You finished your job and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Should I be excited or nervous about that promise…?</i>
