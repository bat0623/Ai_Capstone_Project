<i>Ai called me up earlier, we headed out to Okina for a bit.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Ai dragged you all the way here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Ai.png"/> I wanna go to that shop first and get a bangle.<br/>
It's kinda expensive, though… Could you buy it for me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I know she's loaded and all, but what are friends for?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Ai.png"/> Wha…? I-I'm just kidding!<br/>
I wanted to see what you'd do, that's all.<br/>
But thanks anyways.<br/>
&gt; It promises to be an entertaining day.<br/>
&gt; You spent some time with Ai.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Had a fun day, we're still waiting on Naoto's health so not much else.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>9/26/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>It was crappy and raining today, stopped by Aiya then headed home after school. Dojima had something he wanted to show me and Nanako when I got home.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Dojima.png"/> Now then… First off…<br/>
&gt; It seems Dojima has something in mind…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Dojima.png"/> Souji, go call Nanako down here.<br/>
Take your time.<br/>
&gt; You called Nanako, as Dojima ordered you to do..<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Nanako.png"/> You told me to go over there…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dojima had gotten a cake, and made some coffee!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Nanako.png"/> What are we celebrating!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Dojima.png"/> Uhh, well… Today is a special day for us.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Nanako.png"/> A special day…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Dojima.png"/> That's right.<br/>
Today's the day when you, me, and Souji become "family."<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Nanako.png"/> …What about before?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Dojima.png"/> Er, well…<br/>
A-Anyways, it's the day that we become a real family.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Nanako.png"/> Hmmm…<br/>
I don't really get it, but… Cake!!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Dojima.png"/> Alright, let's eat.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Nanako.png"/> Yeah!<br/>
&gt; You spent an enjoyable time together…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Eventually, Nanako petered out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Dojima.png"/> Uhh, well… Heh.<br/>
Er… Sorry about making you go along with this.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Souji.png"/> It was fun.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Dojima.png"/> Huh… You're a nice guy.<br/>
&gt; Dojima looks happy.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Dojima.png"/> I felt like I needed to do this to draw the line…<br/>
And I wanted Nanako to know…<br/>
She has to know how important my daughter is to me…<br/>
……<br/>
She's looking more and more like Chisato…<br/>
Her smile… Her strong attitude…<br/>
It was hard for me even to look at Nanako's face, because she reminds me so much of Chisato.<br/>
Chisato died because she went to pick up Nanako… There were times when I'd come close to believing that.<br/>
But even then, I can't count the number of times she's saved me just by being there…<br/>
If I was living by myself, I would never have thought about taking you in.<br/>
I think I was… scared. Scared to have someone else around…<br/>
<br/>
<i>So that's what it was all about.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Dojima.png"/> I was running away by chasing a guy who'd run away himself… It was almost funny.<br/>
&gt; Dojima's smile looks sad…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Dojima.png"/> Souji… I've been scared this whole time.<br/>
That's why I used revenge as an excuse to spend time away from her…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Souji.png"/> You've stopped running?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Dojima.png"/> That's right.<br/>
I can't make Nanako wait any longer.<br/>
&gt; Dojima nods.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Dojima.png"/> Running, regretting… That crap all ends tonight.<br/>
I'm not going to lose the things that are important to me…<br/>
Never again.<br/>
&gt; You can feel Dojima's strong resolve…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think everything's going to work out for us.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Dojima.png"/> That's the strength you've shown me.<br/>
Thanks, Souji.<br/>
&gt; You sat with Dojima for some time in silence before going to your room.
