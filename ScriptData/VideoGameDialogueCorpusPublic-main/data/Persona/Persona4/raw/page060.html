<br/>
&gt; You told Rise about Naoto being treated "like a child"…<br/>
&gt; And you explained Naoto's abnormal obsession to solve the case.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Rise.png"/> I see…<br/>
So he's being stubborn about the case…<br/>
But it seems like it's rare for Naoto-kun to get so worked up over something.<br/>
Okay… I've got a good feel for him. I think I can do this.<br/>
It wont' take long for me to find him with my Persona, so be ready to follow me once I do!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Rise led us to a weird bunker.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> It's all sci-fi… Heyyy, doesn't it remind you of those secret hideouts in live action shows?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Kanji.png"/> Oh yeah… Hehe, I used to watch Featherman all the time when I was a kid.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Rise.png"/> I hear that those are really tough shoots. A lot of the actors do their own stunts, like jumping through fire themselves.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Well, it's every man's dream to do that stuff.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Yeah, I can understand that. They're action-based, like kung fu movies.<br/>
And just the phrase "secret hideout" has this exciting ring to it!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Souji.png"/> I totally hear you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Actually, when I was a kid, I had my own secret place near the mountain by Yukiko's house.<br/>
I'd pretend that a legendary kung fu master was teaching me special techniques. Hwataaa!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> You got it all wrong…<br/>
But hey, so this secret hideout thingy came from Naoto's mind?<br/>
I guess our proper boy detective isn't as grown up as he looks.<br/>
Alright, let's get going.<br/>
<br/>

<b>Boss Battle: Dominating Machine</b><br/>
This thing is really annoying. It's got a very fixed pattern. It will alternate between casting Power Charge to increase its physical power and Herculean Strike to hit your whole party with a bunch of damage. If it gets a critical on the Herculean Strike it'll Power Charge again. This continues on until it reaches low health. You'll know this is the case because it'll change its posture and stop acting. You've got a few turns at that point to kill it before it uses Last Resort, which will kill it and maybe or maybe not wipe your party out. This guy's not really all that hard. The dick move is that a slightly weaker version of him shows up as trash later in this very fucking dungeon.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> It's useless speaking with you. I need to go back now…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-NaotoShadow.png"/> Why? Why're you leaving me here!? Why am I always left alone!?<br/>
It's so lonely… I don't wanna be alone!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yukiko.png"/> Naoto-kun…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> You wear the same face as me… It's as if you're implying we're one and the same.<br/>
But the difference between me and you is…<br/>
<br/>
<i>That was when things started to get… bad.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-NaotoShadow.png"/> These childish gestures are no mere affectation… They're the truth.<br/>
The fools all say it, don't they…? "You're only a child," "Keep out of our business, kid," and so forth.<br/>
No matter how many cases you spend hours cogitating over, no matter how many crimes you solve, you're a child in their eyes.<br/>
It's your brain they're interested in. The grey matter locked up in that skull.<br/>
As long as they need it, you're an ace detective! But once you're done, it's back to the playpen with you.<br/>
You haven't the means to deal with society's two-faced nature…<br/>
You're just a lonely child.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Naoto…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-NaotoShadow.png"/> I wanna be a grown-up…<br/>
I wanna be a big boy right now… Then they'll see who I am…<br/>
I… I want a reason for me to stay…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> That's enough. I can find my own reason for living…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-NaotoShadow.png"/> Hah… I'm telling you that's impossible.<br/>
You are but a child. How can you change that essential truth?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Naoto was starting to crack under the Shadow's pressure.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00116.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-NaotoShadow.png"/> At your core, you admire the sort of "strong" and "cool" men who populate detective fiction.<br/>
But in trying to emulate them, you must know that in truth, you're nothing of the sort-you're a child.<br/>
There's no avoiding first principles… Admit that you're a child, and admit that there's nothing you can do about it.<br/>
Now then! Our analysis is complete. Let us begin the body alteration procedure.<br/>
You have no objections, do you… "Naoto" Shirogane?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> Stop it!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-NaotoShadow.png"/> "Naoto"… Such a cool, manly name!<br/>
But a name doesn't change the truth. It doesn't let you cross the barrier between the sexes.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yeah, it turned out there were a few things we had missed in our investigation of Naoto. Like the fact he's a she.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00125.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Wait, what…? Did he… Did I hear that right!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Kanji.png"/> H-He's not a guy!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> I won't throw a tantrum… That accomplishes nothing…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-NaotoShadow.png"/> *chuckle * Hahahaha! How often I've heard those words from the adults.<br/>
"Throwing a tantrum won't solve anything, Naoto-kun," and other such bilge!<br/>
They made you cry, didn't they?<br/>
Yet here you are, mimicking those same men. What exactly are you trying to justify?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> What…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-NaotoShadow.png"/> It's all right. You needn't suffer anymore. That's why you're undergoing this body alteration procedure to begin with.<br/>
You throw a tantrum, but it fails to change the situation a single bit… I can quite understand the feeling.<br/>
After all… I am you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> That's not true!!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Don't say it!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Kanji.png"/> It's okay… Let the kid spill the whole thing.<br/>
If not, Naoto's just gonna keep hurting…<br/>
We'll just do our job and kick the Shadow's ass. Yeah?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-NaotoShadow.png"/> *chuckle * Ahahahaha! As if you know anything about me!<br/>
You'll kick my ass, huh? Fine… Go ahead and try, you lizard-brained imbecile!!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00148.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-NaotoShadow.png"/> What? Are you sick of yourselves too?<br/>
Very well… Then let's begin the special operation!<br/>
<br/>
<b>Boss Battle: Shadow Naoto</b><br/>
Shadow Naoto is a very strange fight. She's got no weaknesses or immunities, but is resistant to Fire (which makes sense, but only in long retrospect). She starts out the fight with a mix of Attacks, Brave Blade (a powerful physical hit), and a really nasty attack called Mute Ray that does heavy damage, mutes, and drains SP from the character. This is actually probably the most dangerous thing Shadow Naoto does in practice because it's very easy to find yourself running out of gas towards the end if you're not high enough level to really kill her quickly. After you've done some damage, Shadow Naoto changes tactics up a bit. You'll know you've reached this phase because there's a vocal taunt.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00151.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Then she'll cast Element Zero, a spell that negates all your elemental resistances for a few turns. Now she'll largely stop using physicals, and gains all four elemental -dyne spells and an attack called Galgalim Eyes. Galgalim Eyes is a quite nasty little move that reduces someone to 1 HP and afflicts them with the Enervation status, which halves their stats. So this is where we also start to see how Shadow Naoto's AI is different. Shadow Naoto will try to target any weaknesses in the party with her -dyne spells. So, for example, if you've got Yukiko in the party she'll almost exclusively use Mabufudyne. She'll especially focus on elemental spells when Element Zero is active. If she does manage to knock someone down she'll usually follow it up with a Mute Ray, which is of course pretty bad. When we get her into the lower parts of her health bar, we'll see another phase change.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00155.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-NaotoShadow.png"/> Why won't you lie down and die!? You children can't do anything at all!<br/>
<br/>
She'll cast Element Zero again, and then start constantly throwing out elemental magic. She also gains Element Zero as a normal skill now, so she can just refresh it whenever she feels like now. This phase will either be very easy or very hard. If you're high enough level and have enough SP left to weather the barrage of -dyne level magic you'll win, otherwise you'll die. It's that simple.<br/>
<br/>
So the trick to Shadow Naoto is pretty simple really. It starts and ends at your party selection, really. You need to minimize your weaknesses, because it's absolutely crucial that Naoto not get a bunch of extra Mute Rays off and tank your SP into the ground. Beyond that, it's just a matter of dragging her down. There's not much to it, and if you're having problems it's almost certainly just that you aren't high enough level. Oh, and Shadow Naoto has a hilarious death animation (and really just awesome animations in general).<br/>
<br/>
<i>We smashed the Shadow into wreckage, eventually.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> Ngh…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yukiko.png"/> Are you awake!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> Where am I…?<br/>
I remember you all arriving, and…<br/>
That's right… You saw everything…<br/>
……<br/>
I lost both my parents in an accident. I was still young, so my grandfather took me in.<br/>
I was inept at making friends… so I spent my time reading detective novels in my grandfather's study.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-NaotoShadow.png"/> When I grow up… I'm gonna be an awesome, hard-boiled detective…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> My parents were proud of their job. I had no qualms about following in their footsteps…<br/>
An inherited occupation can feel stifling to many, but I welcomed it. I yearned for the day I could be a detective myself…<br/>
Perhaps I inherited that desire from them as well.<br/>
I was always alone… Seeing that, my grandfather must have believed it was his duty to help me realize my dream.<br/>
I secretly aided my grandfather with his clients… And before I knew it, people started calling me Junior Detective.<br/>
At first, I was delighted. But not everything went so smoothly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yukiko.png"/> What was that you said about "You're only a child..."?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> Not everyone welcomes my collaboration when it comes to solving cases…<br/>
My status as a "child" was sufficient to offend many of those whom I worked with.<br/>
Were that the only issue, then it would have resolved itself with time…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Poor Naoto. She's trying so hard to prove herself as a detective, but she's so afraid that she'll never reach her dreams because of something she can't change.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-P4-00177.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yukiko.png"/> Do you not like being a girl…?<br/>
Is that why you always dress like a boy?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> My sex doesn't fit my ideal image of a detective…<br/>
Besides, the police department is a male-oriented society.<br/>
If they had the slightest "concrete" reason to look down on me, no one would need me anymore…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Kanji.png"/> You don't know that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yukiko.png"/> Hey…<br/>
You must know already that what you yearn for isn't to become an adult or become a boy…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> ……<br/>
You're absolutely right.<br/>
I'm sorry… I kept ignoring you, pretending you didn't exist.<br/>
But you are me… and I am you. You've always been inside me.<br/>
What I should yearn for… No, what I must strive for isn't to become a man.<br/>
It's to accept myself for who I really am…<br/>
&gt; The strength of heart required to face oneself has been made manifest…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And by understanding that she needed to stop trying to be something she never could, Naoto gained the power of Persona.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-P4-00193.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Naoto has faced her other self…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Her Persona is Sukuna-Hikona, who I only recall as a tiny little god.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-P4-00195.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>That just left one other bit of business to discuss, really.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-P4-00196.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> Haha… No wonder the perpetrator has eluded the police…<br/>
But it's apparent now… This case is far from over.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> That's right… And you proved it, Naoto.<br/>
Anyways, we can talk more later. We need to get you out of here.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We returned to Junes. Naoto was barely able to walk, I think that was especially hard on her.</i><br/>

<br/>
&gt; Naoto is breathing heavily…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Sheesh… She really put her life on the line for this…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yukiko.png"/> But without her efforts, we'd never have realized…<br/>
…that the culprit is still at large.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Kanji.png"/> You're too frickin' reckless, dammit…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> I never doubted that you'd all come for me…<br/>
Although the reality turned out to be far beyond what I'd imagined.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Kanji.png"/> Tch… What a dumbass. You're no genius at all.<br/>
We were tearing our hair out over you…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Rise.png"/> So you did worry about her, Kanji! Awww…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Kanji.png"/> Shuddup! M-Mind your own damn business!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yukiko.png"/> I'll take her home. I don't think she can go back by herself.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> It's… all right… I can…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Rise.png"/> No way, missy! Don't think that doing everything on your own is the "adult" thing to do!<br/>
C'mon, let's go. Grab on!<br/>
&gt; You were able to rescue Naoto safely.<br/>
And… it seems the case is not over yet…<br/>

You didn't already know he was found, did you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Adachi.png"/> Awww, you really oughtta do somethin' about that habit of yours, Dojima-san.<br/>
They go to the same school. Rumors spread fast out here, y'know.<br/>
But man, why'd Naoto-kun disappear?<br/>
I guess he can be a little difficult… Maybe he got sulky after being given the boot and ran away from home?<br/>
But I tell you, I was shocked to hear that he up and vanished like that.<br/>
If there'd been a fourth kidnapping and murder, we'd be back to square one again…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Dojima.png"/> Adachi…<br/>
<br/>
<i>That man runs his mouth like crazy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-P4-00237.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Adachi.png"/> How're we gonna make a case like this?<br/>
I wonder if Dojima-san's instinct is right… Maybe there really is another perp out there. The real one…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Dojima.png"/> Adachi! How many times I gotta say it!? Quit running your mouth like that!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Adachi.png"/> Whoa! S-Sorry!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Dojima.png"/> Alright, see here!<br/>
Don't worry about the case. Just go study like a normal student.<br/>
If you don't…<br/>
……<br/>
*sigh * I'm going to bed.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Adachi.png"/> Sorry… I killed the mood there.<br/>
But yeah, I can totally understand why Dojima-san's worried.<br/>
Just leave the case to us police. You know the problems it could cause if something happened, right?<br/>
Like, if it happened you were mixed up in it, we'd be real worried…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Nanako.png"/> Are more scary things going to happen?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Adachi.png"/> N-No way, Nanako-chan! Everything's all right now!<br/>
We caught the bad man, so no more scary things will happen. Right? Everything's just fine.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Nanako.png"/> Okay…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Adachi.png"/> A-Anyways, your dad's just a worrywart.<br/>
Leave it to me! You might not know to look at me, but I got the most brains in the whole police department!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yeah neither of us were very convinced by that statement.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-P4-00257.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Adachi.png"/> W-Well, now that Dojima-san's gone, I should get going too… G'nite!<br/>
&gt; Adachi went back home.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Nanako.png"/> What does "got brains" mean?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Souji.png"/> It means he's smart.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Nanako.png"/> Huh… So things'll be all right…?<br/>
&gt; Nanako has fallen silent…<br/>
&gt; The night passes with the awkward mood hanging in the air…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Another killer… And this one is clever enough to avoid the suspicion of the police, Naoto, and all of us. How the hell will we ever find them?</i>
