&gt; Christmas Eve is tomorrow…<br/>
&gt; You received a text message…<br/>
<b>Naoto's Message:</b> SEE U TOMORROW? Y/N<br/>
PLZ REPLY ASAP<br/>
&gt; You decided to spend time with Naoto tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
<b>12/24/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>It's so nice for things to be back to normal again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> U-Um… It's pretty cold outside!<br/>
Ah, well, uhh…<br/>
I-I'm sorry… I guess I'm nervous… because, um, we're the only ones here…<br/>
&gt; Naoto seems embarrassed…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> That's a… wonderful cake. It makes me feel like a kid again.<br/>
Um, I have something for you. I was late because I had to go back home to get it before I came here.<br/>
&gt; Obtained Handmade Watch.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> I customized this watch. It has the normal functions of a digital watch, but…<br/>
It can also tell you where I am…<br/>
…It's just a toy, though, so it only has a radius of a few meters.<br/>
And… J-Just so you know, my watch has a similar function…<br/>
……<br/>
My watch can tell me… where you are.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Naoto's really good at making things, it's impressive.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> Really? …I'm glad.<br/>
Although… from spring on, my watch will just say "out of range"…<br/>
Until then… I want to be with you as much as possible.<br/>
&gt; You had a wonderful Christmas Even with Naoto…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh, uh, Naoto had brought something else along.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> I…<br/>
Umm… I…<br/>
I want you to see me in a school uniform…<br/>
……<br/>
You said you liked it when I spoke with a higher voice…<br/>
So I figured I should look more like a girl…<br/>
B-Besides, my normal clothes go against the school dress code…<br/>
Let me go change…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was kind of weird, gonna be honest.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> I know this is what all the girls wear, but, um… Isn't the skirt too short…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>And she wasn't very comfortable with it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> P-Please stop!<br/>
Don't embarrass me…<br/>
……<br/>
I-I think I'll stick with my normal outfit…<br/>
I'd feel awkward all day if I wore it at school.<br/>
……<br/>
…But I'm happy that I showed it to you.<br/>
……<br/>
…Huh?<br/>
……<br/>
Y-You want me here tonight…?<br/>
……<br/>
I-I can probably come up with some kind of alibi for where I spent the night…<br/>
……<br/>
&gt; The watch reads: "Distance: &lt;1 m"…<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> I think we can safely leave the rest to the police.<br/>
Adachi has confessed to his crimes, so I'm sure Namatame's presumed guilt will be reexamined as well.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> I see…<br/>
Then that really wraps it up.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> What'll you do now, Teddie? You're not going back over there, are you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Kanji.png"/> You better not, you dumb bear! You don't know how much you worried us last time…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Teddie2.png"/> I-I won't suddenly disappear like that again!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> Damn straight you won't. Man, just stay here, alright?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Just then I got a call.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> Hey, it's me.<br/>
Good news. It looks like they're letting Nanako come home for a bit.<br/>
She's awake again, and she's got a good amount of strength back too.<br/>
All goes well, she might be able to leave the hospital for the time being.<br/>
And as for me, hey said I just needed to see a doctor regularly. So I'm planning to come home with Nanako today.<br/>
Sorry I had to stick you with all the housework. I'll make up for it somehow. Anyway, I'll see you later.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I told everyone the good news.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yukiko.png"/> I-I'm so happy for her…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Teddie2.png"/> Me too… I'm really glad…<br/>
The fog's all gone over here because everyone tried so hard… And now Nana-chan's gotten better!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> Nanako-chan tried hard too…<br/>
Sh-She's such an amazing girl… *sob *<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Teddie2.png"/> W-Waaaaaaah!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> Seriously… Thank heavens she's okay.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/>*sniff * *sniff *<br/>
Where're you touching!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Teddie2.png"/> Augh…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> Well, one thing's certain…<br/>
It's party time!<br/>
Let's throw a big Christmas party for Nanako-chan!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Teddie2.png"/> A party, you say!? I'm sure Nana-chan will be delighted!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yukiko.png"/> We'll need a cake then.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> G-Guys… Please say you're not gonna…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And then they said it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00091.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> Of course we're gonna make one.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yukiko.png"/> I've already researched the ingredients.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> Hey-W-Wait! Wait a sec! Whoa there!<br/>
That's way too tall an order for you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> Let's go to the grocery department!<br/>
C'mon, Naoto-kun, you too!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> B-But I've never baked a cake…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yukiko.png"/> Don't worry. Neither have we!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We tried not to let it dim our excitement.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Teddie2.png"/> So this is the fabled kotatsu…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Nanako.png"/> I was really looking forward to the new kotatsu!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> Yeah, you talked about it all the time at the hospital.<br/>
Nanako's going back for a close checkup tomorrow, but at this rate, the doctors say she can leave the hospital soon.<br/>
If I'd gotten better sooner, we would've been able to buy the kotatsu together… Sorry.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Souji.png"/> Don't worry about it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Nanako.png"/> Okay…<br/>
Next time, let's go together!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> Sorry for the wait!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> Oh no… The Christmas edition of Mystery Food X is about to be served…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Kanji.png"/> Bring it on, I'm ready. Got my insurance card and everything.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Needless to say we were floored.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00112.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> Hey, this is bigger than I imagined…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Kanji.png"/> Wait, Nanako-chan! I'll be the first one to-<br/>
NOOOOOO!!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Nanako.png"/> It's delicious!<br/>
It tastes really good!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> Th-That can't be…<br/>
No… Has she lost all sense of taste?<br/>
&gt; She's right! It's like nothing you've tasted before!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> Did you guys really make this?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> Huh? O-Of course we did.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yukiko.png"/> Does it actually taste like something…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> It's not hot, is it?<br/>
How is it Kanji? Hm?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Kanji.png"/> I-It's amazing!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> You know what they say about true talent not needing to show off? Turns out we had good taste in cooking after all.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> Then again, this one was our third attempt…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Teddie2.png"/> Hey, Yosuke! Chie-chan and the others really are talented chefs! Three starts for sure!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> I-Impossible… This… actually tastes good!<br/>
Wait, I didn't already pass out, did I? This isn't a dream, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Teddie2.png"/> Ummm… Nana-chan, guess what I have…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Teddie had been busy the past few days.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00133.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Nanako.png"/> Oh! It looks just like you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Teddie2.png"/> I wish I could've made it look better…<br/>
But I thought it'd keep you company at the hospital, Nana-chan.<br/>
Oh, and it's made from 100% pure Teddie fur. I'm a guy who's all about using all-natural materials!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> I-Isn't that nice of him, Nanako?<br/>
Teddie fur…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Nanako.png"/> Uh-huh!<br/>
Thank you, Teddie.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> I have to thank you all again…<br/>
Adachi confessed to the two murders. He insists it was him who hung the bodies, too.<br/>
There are still things that are unclear about his story, but he's most likely gonna pay for his crimes.<br/>
Anyway, this was one strange case…<br/>
If what you said about a world inside the TV was true, then everything might make sense…<br/>
…Though I still don't believe it.<br/>
Some things in this world just can't be explained.<br/>
Like Nanako… She made a miraculous recovery, and now she's as healthy as ever.<br/>
Back in the day… my own senpai on the force told me something.<br/>
"There's an underside to everything that you can never see."<br/>
This case has made me think about a lot of things…<br/>
You've helped us out so much… Heh, it was meant to be the other way around, really…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dojima brought up something I've sort of been wishing wasn't the case.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00154.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chie.png"/> That's right… You're only here until spring, huh…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> Senpai? You're going back…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Naoto.png"/> …It won't be the same without you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Teddie2.png"/> Sensei… Are you going somewhere…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Souji.png"/> I don't want to go back.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> Don't forget, there are people waiting for you.<br/>
When you get home, show your parents how much you've grown this past year.<br/>
And then, if they're okay with it… you can come back here at any time.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> C'mon, spring's a long ways off, right? Let's have all the fun we can until then!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Dojima.png"/> H-Hey, don't get too carried away. My sis would kill me if you got yourself held back a year…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, but then you wouldn't have to go back, huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Rise.png"/> Wow, if that happened, I'd be in the same grade as Senpai.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Souji.png"/> Call me Senpai anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<i>But spring's still a long ways off…</i><br/>
