<i>It was raining earlier today, which really gave us a scare at first.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Looks like the rain'll stop in the afternoon.<br/>
The forecast was saying it'll be a while before any fog shows up.<br/>
<br/>
<i>When we saw it would end before the afternoon, we were less worried.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah. I'm countin' on ya, Leader.<br/>

That lazy punk is always ditching! I'd expel his ass from school if I were his homeroom teacher!<br/>
You may not think it's any of your business, but it is! You could all be expelled just as easily!<br/>
Cause any problems, and you earn a one-way ticket out of this place! You best keep that in mind!<br/>

<i>What an asshole. Before we headed into the TV, I decided to see if the fox had another wish for me. Sure enough he did.</i><br/>

&gt; Igor is nowhere to be found…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Margaret.png"/> Oh…<br/>
Excuse me. Do you have any business here?<br/>
Mmm… As you can see, my master is currently away.<br/>
If your errand isn't urgent, I regret to ask that you come back lat-<br/>
No, that won't do.<br/>
This room is bound tightly too your fate. Nothing here happens without a reason…<br/>
There must be meaning in our meeting here alone.<br/>
Welcome to the Velvet Room.<br/>
I am Margaret.<br/>
I am the one who rules over power, invited here after my predecessor's sudden disappearance.<br/>
You may be the first person who has ever been welcomed her by someone other than my master.<br/>
The Velvet Room is inseparable from the heart of its invited guest…<br/>
The shape of the room and its residents are selected by my master, based on the number of guests and their destiny…<br/>
Shall we chat?<br/>
I feel that is what I am called to do.<br/>
&gt; A faint smile appeared on Margaret's face.<br/>
&gt; Her eyes have a hint of gentleness in them, unlike her normal gaze…<br/>
&gt; You feel a faint bond forming between your and Margaret…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't know which is stranger, a link with a fox or a link with a supernatural lady from a room that may or may not be real. Also I'm kind of concerned she might be hitting on me.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Margaret.png"/> It seems you have several "Social Links" already.<br/>
Recurring meetings, recurring words… By deepening your understanding of one another, your bonds strengthen.<br/>
But sometimes the heart is shaken more by a single action than a thousand words.<br/>
Do you understand?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Before this started I'd have had no idea what she was talking about, but now I think I'm beginning to.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Margaret.png"/> Hmhm…<br/>
Today's meeting might be classified as that single action.<br/>
I've decided.<br/>
The strand of fate you follow… Entangle me within it as well.<br/>
Perhaps a new bond will be spun.<br/>
There is something I have wanted to know, and you are the first guest I welcomed here…<br/>
In light of today's meeting with my master absent… Hm.<br/>
I believe we are both special to one another…<br/>
&gt; Margaret is smiling…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Margaret.png"/> I want to know more about you.<br/>
First, I think I shall have you show me your rare Persona ability.<br/>
Let me see…<br/>
Show me an Ippon-Datara that knows Sukukaja.<br/>
The heart is shaken more by a single action than by a thousand words… Have you already forgotten?<br/>
Hmhm, then I have something to look forward to.<br/>
I wish you well.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I found myself back in the lobby. A quick inventory revealed all the components I'd need to complete this task on hand, so I headed back for the Velvet Room.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>What a strange thing. Anyway, Margaret was impressed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Margaret.png"/> An Ippon-Datara with Sukukaja… You have successfully completed the quest…<br/>
Well-rounded, flexible, muscular… Splendid.<br/>
…You've done good work here.<br/>
You are indeed the one with infinite potential…<br/>
*chuckle *… Now I'm even more curious about you.<br/>
&gt; Margaret is smiling gently…<br/>
&gt; You became a little more intimate with Margaret…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Seriously I think she's hitting on me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Margaret.png"/> Well then… For my next request…<br/>
Bring me a Matador with the Mahama skill. I know that if anyone can do this for me, it's you.<br/>
I eagerly await your return.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I wasn't quite strong enough to create a Matador, whatever the hell that was supposed to be, so we headed back to the damn sauna.</i><br/>

The steam's getting worse, so I can't tell where Kanji-kun is at all…<br/>
Maybe it's already time for me to retire from being a guide…<br/>
<br/>

Are you trying to break the barrier of the acceptable, just like me?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Teddie.png"/> No! Sensei came to rescue Kanji!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-ShadowKanji.png"/> OoooOOOOoooh! Does that mean you're yearning for me? Is that so?<br/>
Oh, that makes me sooooo happy!<br/>
Well then, I simply MUST prepare something spectacular for you!<br/>
I'm so looking forward to seeing you soon!<br/>
Well, tootaloo!<br/>

<br/>
<b>Boss: Daring Gigas</b><br/>
This guy is an ass. He's only got one trick but it's a real show-stopper. He'll buff himself with Tarukaja to increase his attack power and Rebellion to increase his crit rate, then use Power Charge. This makes his next physical move do about 2.5x normal damage. At this point he'll unleash a brutal attack on someone. When any of the buffs wear off he'll renew them. He's not really weak to anything and can counter physicals. Bringing a Persona with resistance to physical is pretty helpful, just in case. There's not really much 'strategy' to this, though, it's a slugfest.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Teddie.png"/> ……<br/>
Hey, Sensei?<br/>
The world you came from seems really complicated…<br/>
Even since I met you, I really had to think hard about stuff like what I am…<br/>
So I can kinda understand how Kanji feels.<br/>
……<br/>

I'm gonna get myself pumped up again to look for Kanji!<br/>
Concentrate! Raaaaaaaaawr!<br/>
……<br/>
Here goes!<br/>
……<br/>
Whoa… this feeling! I think I've made a comeback!<br/>
Kanji's not far from here!<br/>
I'm positive he's really close by!<br/>

<b>Boss Battle: Shadow Kanji</b><br/>
We're up against Shadow Kanji and his two buddies, the Nice Guy and the Tough Guy. In the first phase of the fight, Shadow Kanji's only abilities are Swift Strike, Fatal End, and Power Charge. Normally he'll just alternate between Power Charges and Swift Strikes, it's actually sort of rare for him to use Fatal End or a Swift Strike without a Charge. He's not weak against anything, and is immune to lightning. The Tough Guy uses a mix of largely ineffectual physical skills and is actually really hard to kill, so we'll just ignore him. The Nice Guy uses a lot of buffs, including Heat Riser (+Offense/Defense/Agility), which is needless to say really annoying. Our strategy for the start of the fight, then, is to kill the Nice Guy while keeping the enemy party's buffs clear with Yosuke's Dekaja every few turns (or just in general if Kanji's both Charged and Heat Risered, that is sort of dangerous). Once the Nice Guy is down, we can move on to Kanji. When his health gets to about 2/3 max, he'll telegraph his first phase change by saying this:<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00181.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
In this phase he gains the skill Forbidden Murmur, which he'll always use that turn. This skill attempts to poison your whole party, so hopefully you brought some Dokudami Tea to cure it. At about 50% Kanji will start mixing his moves up a bit more, which is telegraphed by this taunt.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00183.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Things don't get really exciting until he's at about a third of his health, though.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00184.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-ShadowKanji.png"/> No matter what, I won't lose!<br/>
<br/>
At this point he will always cast a special lightning skill, Fanatical Spark, and he'll start using it quite heavily from this point on. If he manages to knock down Yosuke with this, he'll spend his One More on a Fatal End usually. <br/>
<br/>
So, there's a rather obvious way to make this fight a lot easier for you, which is to bring a Persona that resists Physical attacks. I generally use Rakshasa for this, because it's Strength Arcana (which should mean it gets a lot of bonus exp on fusion even this early) and it gets Kill Rush, which is broken as fuck (watch the video if you want to see exactly why). The thing to remember is that Kanji's offense and defense aren't that impressive when he's not buffed. You can blast through that last 33% where he gets dangerous pretty damn quickly if you go all-out. I suggest you be about level 24 or so for this, which isn't hard at all if you don't duck out of fights in the Sauna.<br/>
