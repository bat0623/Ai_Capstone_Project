<i>We're going to wait for the weekend to take our first crack at whatever Adachi's got waiting for us.</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>Scared Student:</b> Is this fog getting thicker and thicker? …Or is it just me!?<br/>
Does this mean the world's coming to an end!? I actually heard someone say that!<br/>
Wh-What do you think's gonna happen? Earthquake!? Tsunami!?<br/>
<b>Braided Girl:</b> Huh? Nothing's gonna happen. It's just fog, you doofus.<br/>
Besides, if something terrible happens, the Defense Force or somebody is sure to come save us.<br/>
<b>Scared Girl:</b> Yeah, I guess you're right.<br/>
Ah!<br/>
What if some giant monster attacks Inaba!? Or aliens!? I saw a movie about something like this!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We got our exam grades back, at least I don't have to worry about my grades.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided to see how Ai was holding up, we went up to the roof to talk.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> I don't mind.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Ai.png"/> Thank you, Souji… You really are a nice guy.<br/>
&gt; Ai smiles gently…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Ai.png"/> …After I calmed down, I gave my life some serious thought.<br/>
Why do I go on such crazy shopping sprees? Why do I feel the need to be so well dressed all the time?<br/>
What makes me want to ditch class? Do I want to stand out so that I'll catch people's eyes?<br/>
……<br/>
And… why do I always find myself wanting to talk to you?<br/>
I always thought that if I couldn't be pretty, I'd be better off dead…<br/>
Nobody likes people who aren't pretty. They hate you. What's the point of life if everybody hates you…?<br/>
But lately I've been thinking, maybe I'm wrong…<br/>
There's still a lot I don't know… I guess I shouldn't be jumping to any conclusions.<br/>
And before I realized it, I was crying. I've always made sure not to cry, too, because it makes my eyes swell…<br/>
I pulled back my curtains, and the sun was just coming up… The stars were shining so dimly…<br/>
And for some reason, it made me think of you…<br/>
I wonder why…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Ai really is a great person underneath.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Ai.png"/> I have a lot of male acquaintances… But you're probably the first one I can call a real friend.<br/>
&gt; Ai smiles happily…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Ai.png"/> …You're a weird guy, Souji.<br/>
I'm glad we met.<br/>
&gt; You feel genuine trust coming from Ai…<br/>
&gt; Your relationship with Ai has deepened…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I can't let Adachi destroy her, and everyone else I've met here in Inaba.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Ai.png"/> Let's go home, huh?<br/>
If they catch you with me, you'll probably get all the extra lectures too…<br/>
&gt; You parted with Ai and went home…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided to tutor when I got home.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Shu.png"/> I comes after the word "have," so I should be using the past participle… "done," right?<br/>
&gt; You began to explain the sentence to him in an easily-understood manner.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Shu.png"/> …Is English all about memorization, too?<br/>
Math is just remembering the right formulas and applying them. Chemistry is just remembering chemical equations.<br/>
The tests are just there to see if you can remember then, and to penalize you if you forget…<br/>
……<br/>
Is there any bullying at your school?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> No, there isn't.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Shu.png"/> I guess I'd expect that from people in high school. You're more mature.<br/>
&gt; Shu nods.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Shu.png"/> It's not like they're punching him or hiding things from him or anything… They're not stealing his money…<br/>
It's just that he… He doesn't have a place there.<br/>
Maybe that's not the same thing as bullying.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's definitely the same thing, but things like that won't get better if you do nothing.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Shu.png"/> Effort…<br/>
Oh… I see.<br/>
&gt; Shu thinks to himself…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Shu.png"/> Oh, uh… It's not about me.<br/>
It's about… the transfer student. The one I was talking about before. Not me.<br/>
……<br/>
It seems that I've been talking to you about things that really aren't relevant to my studies…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> I don't mind.<br/>
&gt; You told Shu that his talking about school didn't bother you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Shu.png"/> ...Thank you.<br/>
&gt; Shu seems somewhat happy.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Shu.png"/> Umm… You'll come again, won't you?<br/>
&gt; It seems that Shu is starting to open up to you…<br/>
&gt; You feel that your relationship with Shu has deepened.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Of course, I won't get to come back if we all die on Saturday…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00083.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Shu.png"/> Then… take care.<br/>
&gt; You finished your tutoring job and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<b>12/9/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>We're going in tomorrow.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00086.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yukiko.png"/> It's finally time to fight the real culprit.<br/>
To be honest, I'm still shocked to learn that it was Adachi-san…<br/>
But… I can never forgive what he said… or what he's done.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> Are you alright?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yukiko.png"/> Oh, yes. Thank you for worrying about me, though.<br/>
I'm fine.<br/>
I'm worried about Nanako-chan! And we can't just let him do whatever he wants!<br/>
We have to put an end to all of this… Right?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think Kashiwagi is so unaware that the fog just doesn't do anything to her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kashiwagi.png"/> They're saying it can even beat out the germs from the fog. That's why I've been doing it every day since I saw it.<br/>
I recommend that you all give it a try. Besides, we'll feel better about it if we do it together, right?<br/>
Well, let's get down to business.<br/>
Are you guys aware of how many life forms are living in the world at any given time?<br/>
Let's see… I'll pick on the ever-energetic Souji-kun.<br/>
Which of the following has the largest population on Earth?<br/>
<br/>
<i>A real softball this time.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00107.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kashiwagi.png"/> Gooood job! *giggle * You're right. Insects make up the largest population on our planet.<br/>
Within the insect world, the ant is probably the most prevalent. They adapt and multiply quickly.<br/>
If aliens found Earth and tried to communicate with our most prosperous lifeform…<br/>
It'd probably be the ants. *giggle *<br/>
<br/>
<i>Ai wanted to talk to me about something, so I hung out with her on the roof again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00115.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Ai.png"/> The other day, I bumped into him… And we talked for a while.<br/>
You know, Daisuke-kun.<br/>
But… nothing happened.<br/>
My heart didn't race.<br/>
He was just… a normal, good guy. I guess what I felt was kind of a fleeting thing.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> Happens all the time.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Ai.png"/> You mean, like… falling in love with the idea of being in love…?<br/>
Haha… I never thought that would happen to me… I guess I was wearing my heart on my sleeve, huh?<br/>
&gt; Ai shrugs.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Ai.png"/> …I was lying to myself.<br/>
Whenever there's been two ways I could go, I always did what the "ideal girl" would do. I forgot about the real me…<br/>
……<br/>
The real me likes bulldogs more than German Shepherds.<br/>
…I'm better at long-distance running than sprints, I prefer milk over tea, and I like daifuku more than cream puffs.<br/>
I don't know how to hook up a TV, I think aromatherapy smells bad, and any purse that'll carry stuff is fine…<br/>
……<br/>
But I hid that part of me away, and just pretended it wasn't there.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's not just those of us with Personas searching for who we really are.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00133.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Ai.png"/> That's why… right now, I feel pretty good.<br/>
&gt; Ai smiles cheerfully…<br/>
&gt; You feel you were able to support Ai in her time of need…<br/>
<br/>
<i>But if the world ends, that's all over.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00137.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Ai.png"/> Wow, it's already getting dark. I guess it's true: time really does fly when you're having fun…<br/>
…Bye-bye, Souji. I'll see you later.<br/>
&gt; You parted with Ai and went home…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Something caught my eye back at home, there was a little piece of paper sticking out from under the cushion Nanako sat on when she was home.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; …?<br/>
&gt; You noticed a paper under the cushion…<br/>
&gt; …It's written in Nanako's writing.<br/>
&gt; "My big bro is the best in his class. He's a genius!"<br/>
&gt; "Congratulations! I want to honor you for what you've done."<br/>
&gt; It's a handmade certificate of accomplishment, made by Nanako.<br/>
&gt; Was she thinking of giving this to you if you got the top score?<br/>
&gt; …Obtained Partial Award.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Feinne's Notes:</b><br/>
The Partial Award is an accessory that gives Souji the Endure passive, letting him avoid death at 1 HP once per battle. It's exactly as good as it sounds, though it's also probably the easiest of these effects to replicate.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We're going in tomorrow. We'll just have to see what that bastard has in store for us.</i><br/>
