			<b>6/26/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>Yosuke came over today. He's kind of a weird guy, not gonna lie.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Yosuke pretty much barged in…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hmmmm, it's pretty clean.<br/>
So…? You keep the goods under your futon?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Naturally I had no idea what he was talking about.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hahaha! Why are you acting so dignified about it?<br/>
Alright, I'll check 'em out when you go take a piss or something.<br/>
I'll expose your embarrassing tastes!!<br/>
&gt; Yosuke looks like he's having fun.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> So, you ever invited a girl here?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I of course have an active social life.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Haha, maybe you're more of a man's man than I thought.<br/>
&gt; Yosuke seems happy…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Nanako.png"/> Are you up there? Have you seen the public notice anywhere?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Nanako-chan's here? Let's let her in.<br/>
Nanako-chan, are you free today?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Nanako.png"/> No, I'm going to Takeyoshi-kun's house with Miwa-chan and Yo-chan.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> A-A guy's house!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Nanako.png"/> Takeyoshi-kun sits next to me. I'm going to deliver the class notice to him.<br/>
Miwa-chan said she's going with me because she likes Takeyoshi-kun.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Because she likes him…?<br/>
M-Man, kids sure are mature these days…<br/>
Well, my first love was in kindergarten, too! I've always been ahead of my time.<br/>
But, well… I don't really need that in my life right now.<br/>
It's just not the time…<br/>
I have something to do before that can happen…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke was actually getting pretty serious there for a while.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> No… Well, maybe it is.<br/>
You're smart, Nanako-chan!<br/>
&gt; Nanako left for her friend's house…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Nanako-chan called it "homework"…<br/>
Catching the killer, ending the murders, bringing peace to the town… Only we can do it, huh?<br/>
Let's hang in there. I'm counting on you.<br/>
&gt; Yosuke's determination shows through…<br/>
&gt; You sense Yosuke's trust…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke's picked up some stuff from the drug department at Junes to help us out in combat I think, he's handy that way.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, so did the notice reach you yet? The one about joining the young men's association.<br/>
They were talking about having some kind of event to boost the economy.<br/>
Junes is involved with it, so they're trying to rope me in.<br/>
I don't have time for that… I told 'em I was busy, but they keep dogging me.<br/>
I don't care about the young men's association or about boosting the economy…<br/>
&gt; Yosuke sighs…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Alright, time to take a peek under the futon!<br/>
&gt; You talked with Yosuke about different things…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; It has gotten dark, so you said goodbye to Yosuke…<br/>
<br/>
<i>But seriously he's my bro and all but weird dude.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>6/27/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Morooka continues to prove he's the biggest dick in Inaba.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Morooka.png"/> That's Rise, for all you out-of-the-loop morons. All she does are variety shows and silly commercials!<br/>
What's the damn point of running your mouths about some half-wit whose only talent is appearing on shows for idiots?<br/>
Now, I've got the perfect lecture for you assholes! Let's talk some Friedrich Nietzsche!<br/>
It makes sense! Many of you are reacting to your own "ressentiment" toward that idol girl by talking about her, right?<br/>
…Why the hell do you all look so upset!? Stand your ass up, Seta!<br/>
What does "ressentiment" mean? Answer the question!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I always do the reading for this asshole's class just for such situations.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Morooka.png"/> Ah, I see you've already done the reading, smartass.<br/>
Well, you got it right. "Ressentiment" is a French word denoting hatred and jealousy!<br/>
It's different from "resent," because it's used specifically for jealous emotions toward someone better than you!<br/>
I'm sure you're all very familiar with how that feels. At least I won't have to go into much depth on this one.<br/>
And just so you know, there are LOTS more people out there who are much better than you dipshits!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke came to me at lunch, he needed some help at Junes.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> You've got free time today, don't you? Don't you!?<br/>
&gt; Yosuke seems desperate…<br/>
&gt; Will you spend the day with Yosuke?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I can't leave a friend in jeopardy, even if he is weird.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> You're such a good friend to me…!<br/>
You've gotta help me! Just for today!<br/>
I'll see you later then!<br/>
&gt; You decided to spend the afternoon with Yosuke.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Turned out he needed some extra help at Junes, and they were paying so I'm down with that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00076.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You agreed to help with restocking after Yosuke begged you…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Welcome, one and all! Choice salmon, 59 yen a slice, just as advertised!<br/>
And while you're at it, how about some cheese? Direct from Italy and just 298 yen for today only…<br/>
Restock this shelf, too!<br/>
&gt; You earned 5500 yen working at Junes.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed to the food court when the sale was over.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00082.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You came with Yosuke after work…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Phew, I'm dead tired…<br/>
They decided on the sale at the last minute, and Dad was bugging me to find helpers.<br/>
I told him I didn't have time for that, but he wasn't listening.<br/>
But hey, I'm glad you were there! Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm always happy to pull a friend's fat out of the fire, of course.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> You really are a good guy.<br/>
&gt; Yosuke is happy…<br/>
<b>Gaudy Student:</b> Oh, Hanamura.<br/>
What's with the crowd today? It's way busy. If I'd known, I woulda skipped out.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Please don't. You got a bonus for today, right?<br/>
<b>Snooty Student:</b> Yeah, a whole 500 yen.<br/>
I'm trying to save up! Gimme a raise.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Well… I don't think I can help you there…<br/>
<b>Snooty Student:</b> What's the point, then?<br/>
&gt; The two began talking nearby…<br/>
&gt; They're talking very loudly…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Those two are pretty terrible people.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Snooty Student:</b> Why don't you find a guy to pay?<br/>
<b>Gaudy Student:</b> Haha, like Saki did?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> ……<br/>
&gt; Yosuke is biting his lip…<br/>
<b>Snooty Student:</b> Was it last year? Saki's elopement, I mean.<br/>
<b>Gaudy Student:</b> Yep. Apparently she got with a college guy who came home, and went off with him.<br/>
But she came right back, saying she'd save money and leave on her own.<br/>
<b>Snooty Student:</b> Huh? You mean she was dumped?<br/>
<b>Gaudy Student:</b> Who knows… She started working here to save money, didn't she?<br/>
You know us high school girls can make easy money if we really want to.<br/>
&gt; The pair's gossiping continues…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke seemed pretty uncomfortable with what they were talking about despite his attempts at composure.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00112.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> It's just hot air. I'm not letting it get to me.<br/>
…It's sad to be talked about like that, though.<br/>
We're the only ones who can avenge Saki-senpai.<br/>
……<br/>
We're special. We're the only ones.<br/>
So… there's no need to bother with outsiders.<br/>
<br/>
<i>He's right of course, it's just us.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00119.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Heheh…<br/>
&gt; Yosuke is smiling sheepishly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I think it's good you came along.<br/>
Because of you, I was able to make it this far.<br/>
&gt; Yosuke is nodding firmly…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Yosuke has grown deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's almost like Yosuke's grown up, just a little bit.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00126.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> *sigh * What a pain.<br/>
……<br/>
Oh, uh, not you…<br/>
…I wonder what it is.<br/>
I dunno…<br/>
&gt; You spent time talking with Yosuke…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Rise's still out and we've not heard anything from Teddie so we're again waiting things out. I hate that we're always having to react to the killer's moves, but that's how it is.</i>
