			<b>12/5/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>We had the day off from school, so we started in early scouring the town for information. There… wasn't much.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Souji.png"/> About those murders…<br/>
<b>Middle-Aged Woman:</b> The incident last spring?<br/>
Did something happen…?<br/>
……<br/>
Oh, that's right… It was a pretty big deal, wasn't it?<br/>
I'd almost completely forgotten about that… Wow, I must be getting old, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Souji.png"/> About those murders…<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> Uh… What are you talking about?<br/>
&gt; You explained about the incident involving Saki and Yamano, the female announcer.<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> Did all that happen just last spring? Wow, it seems so long ago, haha.<br/>
Who's gonna remember something from that far back anyway?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> I wonder if we can really find any new clues about the killer…<br/>
…Eh, no use whining about it now! Let's step up the search and get that info!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Man:</b> You know who I heard it was? …Junes! Yeah, that's right, Junes!<br/>
The country of Junes is staging an all-out attack on Inaba!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> Guy just ignored me and walked off… I know it wasn't personal, but it kinda hurt…<br/>
Damn fog… Hurry up and go away!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> You know, about that first murder… I wonder why it happened…?<br/>
Let's ask around and gather as much information as we can! I'll see you later!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Chie.png"/> But rumors they hear from friends and TV get remembered for a long time… Why is that?<br/>
It's been a while since the first two incidents… Do you think we'll find anyone who still remembers them?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I eventually did find something, though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Shopping Woman:</b> Oh, you have a question for me?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Souji.png"/> About those murders…<br/>
<b>Shopping Woman:</b> A little while ago, they said that a suspect had been caught. It was in the newspaper.<br/>
It was that Namatame-san, right? I remember seeing him around from time to time.<br/>
Oh, how horrible… It really does frighten me.<br/>
I don't recall seeing any other strange people, so I'm sure he's the culprit.<br/>
&gt; Is it true that there were no other suspicious individuals…?<br/>
&gt; Perhaps you should ask someone else about this…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Souji.png"/> Recall anyone suspicious?<br/>
<b>Shopping Woman:</b> Have I see any other weird people, aside from Namatame-san? Hmm…<br/>
Uh… Nope, I don't think so.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Loud Old Man:</b> It'll be so cold on New Years that I'll never be happy!<br/>
What do you want?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Souji.png"/> About those murders…<br/>
<b>Loud Old Man:</b> I can't recall something from that long ago!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Souji.png"/> Recall anyone suspicious?<br/>
<b>Loud Old Man:</b> There isn't anyone like that in this town!<br/>
I even know you. You're that kid who's staying at Dojima-kun's house!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Gas-Masked Man:</b> Why am I outside? When I'm at home, I just see more news about the murders.<br/>
I thought I'd stay out here and watch the sun set. Of course, I'm going to watch TV when I go home anyway…<br/>
Even then, I can't see the sun set because of all this fog! Ah, I hate it! It's so depressing!<br/>
Ah, do you have a question?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Souji.png"/> About those murders…<br/>
<b>Gas-Masked Man:</b> Oh come on, don't make me even more depressed!<br/>
They said on the news that the suspect had been caught.<br/>
So that whole thing is over now, right? What else is there?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Souji.png"/> Recall anyone suspicious?<br/>
<b>Gas-Masked Man:</b> It's a small town. If there was anyone suspicious, there would be rumors going around all over.<br/>
But at least I haven't heard any news or rumors like that. So I'd say there's no such person.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Rise.png"/> They're all like, "Oh yeah, that guy in the bear suit from Junes…"<br/>
But nobody has seen him, yesterday or today…<br/>
He's loved by so many different people… Where the heck could he have gone…?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Businessman:</b> This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing! I asked her for her autograph, and what type of guys she's into.<br/>
Anyway, what do you want? I'm sure you can see how busy I am.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Souji.png"/> About those murders…<br/>
<b>Businessman:</b> Didn't they capture the suspect and put a lid on that case?<br/>
Are you done asking questions? Good, now go away.<br/>
I'm very busy talking to Risette right now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Souji.png"/> Recall anyone suspicious?<br/>
<b>Businessman:</b> Hmm? No, I don't think I've seen any suspicious people.<br/>
Except for you, who's interrupting my conversation with Risette!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I headed back to talk to some of those other people again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00083.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> A strange person?<br/>
Nah, I don't think I've seen any.<br/>
I mean, this is a pretty small town, wouldn't you say? If I had, I'm pretty sure I'd remember.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00087.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Middle-Aged Woman:</b> A suspicious person?<br/>
No, I can't think of anyone… Not from this town, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'd exhausted everyone around the central shopping district, so I headed to Junes.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Naoto.png"/> Saki Konishi, and Mayumi Yamano… There should be a commonality between the two.<br/>
Surely, there were some witnesses… Any scrap of data could be useful, no matter how small.<br/>
<br/>
<i>And I hit some more paydirt.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00093.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Souji.png"/> About those murders…<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> Eh? The incident last spring? I don't remember anything from that long ago!<br/>
I'm gonna be studying for college entrance exams next year, so I've got no room for useless information like that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Souji.png"/> Recall anyone suspicious?<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> A suspicious person…?<br/>
Ah, now that you mention it, my friend was saying she saw someone…<br/>
I think she's just wandering around the shopping district, so why don't you ask her?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I headed back, and sure enough she did remember something more.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00102.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> Uh…<br/>
Oh! That!<br/>
You remember Saki Konishi, don't you? You know, she passed away a while ago…<br/>
She told me how that Namatame person came to her one day and started spouting all this craziness.<br/>
Something about the TV… I wonder what that was all about.<br/>
His relation to Saki?<br/>
Hey, I don't know what you're implying, but you've got it all wrong!<br/>
Saki was a good girl! It's just that people misunderstood her!<br/>
&gt; She must be referring to the time when Namatame tried to warn Saki.<br/>
&gt; It seems the thing about Namatame making advances on Saki was a misunderstanding.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I headed down to the Samegawa to see if there was anyone with anything there.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00132.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Kind Man:</b> My wife is all business as usual, but I'm a little worried…<br/>
By the way, do you need anything?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Souji.png"/> About those murders…<br/>
<b>Kind Man:</b> I'm sorry.<br/>
All I remember is that something happened.<br/>
I know it was pretty shocking, but what can I say, a lot of time's passed…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Souji.png"/> Recall anyone suspicious?<br/>
<b>Kind Man:</b> We've had a lot of people come to our store, but I can't say anyone was particularly suspicious.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Souji.png"/> About those murders…<br/>
<b>Elderly Person:</b> Now that you mention it, the town was all abuzz last spring…<br/>
You remember that, don't you?<br/>
&gt; It doesn't look like you'll find any more information on the incidents last spring…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Souji.png"/> Recall anyone suspicious?<br/>
<b>Elderly Person:</b> Have I seen a strange person?<br/>
I don't know…<br/>
Out in the country, if there was anybody strange walking around, everyone would know about it right quick.<br/>
&gt; It doesn't look like you'll find any more information on a suspicious person.<br/>
&gt; You have gathered as much information as you could. You should report back to the group.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We all got together at Aiya. I'd been hoping someone else had better luck than I.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Chie.png"/> This stuff's a lot harder when you don't have a badge to flash… I walked around all day and didn't hear anything good.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yukiko.png"/> It was the same for me.<br/>
There was absolutely no talk about the case whatsoever, let alone the true culprit.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Rise.png"/> Ditto for me.<br/>
Actually in my case, I kept getting bombarded with questions and couldn't get them onto the main subject at all…<br/>
*sigh * The killer must be pretty good to have pulled this off without being seen by anyone in this small town…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> What should we do…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Chie.png"/> Well… One steak bowl please!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> That's not what I meant!<br/>
But then again, I guess we might as well take a break…<br/>
I'll have a crab and egg fried rice.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> I'll have… roast pork ramen with extra noodles.<br/>
&gt; You all finished eating the dishes that you ordered.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Chie.png"/> Now that our tummies are full…<br/>
Let's share what we learned… Even if it wasn't much.<br/>
&gt; You spoke with everyone about the information you gathered today.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Chie.png"/> So, to sum up…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie summarized our situation pretty well.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00172.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Naoto.png"/> The police had an unusually large number of officers in their initial investigation of the first two incidents.<br/>
To find facts that even they overlooked would be difficult indeed, now that over half a year has passed.<br/>
There wasn't a single report of suspicious persons being witnessed to begin with…<br/>
Ms. Yamano had ardent fans whereas Saki-san didn't, but otherwise the conditions are the same.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> Y'know, every time I tried to ask about the case, everyone ignored me and kept ranting about the damn fog.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Rise.png"/> Yeah. That or the Midnight Channel.<br/>
I asked about Teddie too… But no one's seen him.<br/>
Gee… I wonder where he could've gone.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> Do you have anything new, Naoto? Any new, uh… deductions?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Naoto.png"/> Without any new data to work with, there isn't much I can do…<br/>
But there must be someone in town who meets all the criteria for this case.<br/>
The killer must have a connection to both Saki-san and Ms. Yamano…<br/>
As well as be in a position to observe our actions periodically, to some extent…<br/>
Finally, it must be someone who could approach Senpai's house without arousing suspicion…<br/>
……<br/>
…I need some fresh air before I give it more thought. I'll be outside.<br/>
&gt; Just sitting here won't help you think any better…<br/>
&gt; You decide to go outside to get some fresh air…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was snowing again. Yosuke joined us shortly after.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00191.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> Brrrr, it's freezing out here.<br/>
Maybe this'll help clear my head and get my deductive muscles flexing.<br/>
Hey, is it snowing…?<br/>
Too bad the fog's so thick… The snow just gets lost in it.<br/>
&gt; There must be something that's been overlooked…<br/>
&gt; It's urgent that you get over the roadblock facing you. The clues you need must already be in your hands…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> What's the matter?<br/>
&gt; You should go over everything you know one more time…<br/>
&gt; The culprit had some sort of connection with both Mayumi Yamano and Saki Konishi.<br/>
&gt; And judging by the warning letters, the culprit most likely knows about the "other side" and what you did there.<br/>
&gt; It's highly likely that they also knew what Namatame was doing and stood back to watch.<br/>
&gt; Who would know all these things…?<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; Another oddity about the case is that there were almost no witnesses.<br/>
&gt; Both warning letters seem to have been delivered direction to your house, but no one saw anyone suspicious.<br/>
&gt; No one unusual was seen around Mayumi Yamano or Saki Konishi, either…<br/>
&gt; …Despite the police dispatching an unusually high number of officers to perform a thorough investigation.<br/>
&gt; Someone in this small town who fits all the facts…<br/>
&gt; The person who seems to be the most likely culprit is…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I just started mentally listing everyone who could be the killer. It had to be someone in town, someone we even could have seen every day…</i><br/>
