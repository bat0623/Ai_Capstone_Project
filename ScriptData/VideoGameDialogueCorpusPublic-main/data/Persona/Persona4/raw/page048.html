			<b>8/11/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>It was raining today, and I was so bored I actually went fishing. I didn't catch much, but I think I'm getting better. God damn I wish there were still a killer to catch sometimes.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>8/12/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>The rain continued through the morning, which meant today was fog day again. I headed to Aiya for one last celebratory Aiya bowl.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Weather Announcer:</b> The week ended on a wet note as rain clouds moved into the area.<br/>
As a result, a thick fog is expected to form in the Inaba region later tonight…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And as before, the fog rolled in at night.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The fog has set in…<br/>
&gt; No one is appearing on the Midnight Channel.<br/>
&gt; You wonder what happened to Mitsuo Kubo after the police took him away…<br/>
<br/>
<b>8/13/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Even though everything is done, I still felt like doing some training with Chie.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You finished today's training and came here with Chie…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Have you had the steak skewers? The meat is tender and delicious, and they hardly cost anything!<br/>
…It might not even be cow meat.<br/>
Just kidding… Whoa, thinking about it, that's kinda gross, haha…<br/>
The police are here…<br/>
Th-Then is this place really serving fake meat…?<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> Excuse me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Y-Yes? I haven't eaten any of the meat today, I swear!<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> Lately, there's been several incidents with a group of teenagers bullying people around here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> …Bullying?<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> Extortion, if you will.<br/>
Have you seen anyone suspicious?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> N-No, no one in particular…<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> Hmmm, I see… Well, you two be careful then.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> I'm glad it wasn't the meat…<br/>
…But still, bullying!?<br/>
What cowards, ganging up on the weak like that!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Amen to that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> It's so cruel! And stupid!<br/>
&gt; Chie is outraged…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> We'll grab 'em and make them apologize! Right, Leader?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Souji.png"/> Of course.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> I knew you'd say that!<br/>
&gt; Chie looks happy.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Mowing down villains and saving the weak, a lone female fighter stands…<br/>
To protect the town's peace, she throws herself into the battlefield, unbeknownst to all…!<br/>
……<br/>
Ooh, yeah! That sounds cool!<br/>
Souji-kun, leave it to me!<br/>
Though I'd feel better about it if you helped…<br/>
And it'd make me… kinda happy…<br/>
……<br/>
&gt; Chie seems somewhat embarrassed…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Chie has grown yet deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Even if we don't have Shadows to fight anymore we can still make this town a better place.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Alright, first, let's eat!<br/>
"Don't think. Feel…" right? Actually in this case, would it be, "Don't think. Eat?"<br/>
&gt; You walked back home with Chie, eating steak skewers.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dojima came home with a big spread of sushi and Adachi.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> If you're gonna have a celebration, you can't do it halfway.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Nanako.png"/> Celebration?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> Ah, it's about this. Watch.<br/>
<b>Announcer:</b> "I didn't care who it was." "I was pissed off." "I wanted to be famous." The suspect was often heard saying these things…<br/>
The young suspect has confessed to being the culprit behind the recent cases, but he's shown no remorse so far.<br/>
Because of several inconsistencies in the boy's deposition, some have called for a mental examination to be carried out.<br/>
Until then, the police will be continuing their investigation to shed light on all the prior incidents.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Adachi.png"/> It was actually really tough to make a case out of this.<br/>
All we had was the suspect's confession and some circumstantial evidence.<br/>
But the lab found the perp's prints on the victim's clothes, so we made it stick after all.<br/>
Man, isn't crime scene investigation something? Who would've thought you could get viable prints from cloth?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> There's no more scary stuff to worry about. You're safe now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Nanako.png"/> Uh-huh!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Adachi couldn't stop talking about the case, though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Adachi.png"/> A high schooler committing multiple murders and leaving the bodies like that… He was over the edge.<br/>
Good thing we caught him! Now I can stop seeing suspects in every shadow!<br/>
If the killer was still on the loose…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> Enough, Adachi! If you keep running your mouth, the sushi's gonna dry up!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Adachi.png"/> Oh, you're right. Sorry!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> C'mon everyone, eat up.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Adachi.png"/> Well, since you asked…<br/>
Huh? You don't like sushi, Nanako-chan?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Nanako.png"/> There's wasabi in it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> Ahh, that's right. I forgot to tell them to hold the wasabi.<br/>
Here, I'll take it off for you. Which one do you want? Hmm?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Nanako.png"/> …Halibut!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Adachi.png"/> Excellent taste, Nanako-chan.<br/>
As for me, I'll go for sea urchin…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> Hey, there's only one of those!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Adachi.png"/> Too late! First come, first serve.<br/>
&gt; It's been a while since dinner has been this lively…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm kind of bothered by something he said, though. It's almost like he wasn't really sure they had the killer. Maybe it's just my imagination…</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>8/14/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Lord, this week might get exciting really quickly.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00098.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> I ran into Yosuke at Junes.<br/>
He said he was really in a bind because he didn't have enough employees working at Junes.<br/>
He's probably going to come to you and beg for you to rescue him.<br/>
He'll be all, "You've gotta save me from this chaos, Souji!"<br/>
I feel kinda sorry for him, so I'm gonna help him out this week.<br/>
You're welcome too, Souji-kun!<br/>
&gt; Chie hung up…<br/>
&gt; Maybe you should help out at Junes too…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still, that wouldn't be until tomorrow anyway. I headed down to the shopping district, felt like getting some Aiya and Rise was free so we ate lunch together.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00109.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> My grandma's food is kind of bland. Though tofu is good for you, so…<br/>
&gt; There is a suspicious man in front of Rise's house…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Is that a reporter…?<br/>
Or… a stalker?<br/>
&gt; Rise is worried…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I suggested we just run, I don't know, maybe I was still spooked from all that crap Adachi was babbling about them not being sure about the murders.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00115.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Uh, th-that's alright. We don't know if he's really dangerous or not.<br/>
Let's just wait and see, okay?<br/>
But… thanks for that.<br/>
&gt; Rise no longer seems worried.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Hmm, but still… That guy… Where have I…?<br/>
Inoue-san, is that you!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>It seemed Rise knew the guy after all.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00122.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Wh-Why are you here…?<br/>
I already settled everything with the agency…!<br/>
<b>Inoue:</b> I'm here because… Personally, I can't accept that.<br/>
I've watched over you this entire time as your manager…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> I'm no longer a "personality"!<br/>
My private time doesn't belong to a manager anymore!<br/>
Go home. If you don't, I'll call the police.<br/>
<b>Inoue:</b> W-Wait!<br/>
Could you just think it over? I strongly believe that no other actress can play that role better than Rise Kujikawa.<br/>
Your fans were looking forward to the movie, too…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> You still want me to act…!?<br/>
<b>Inoue:</b> Huh…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> …Anyway, I'm through with it! I have nothing to do with showbiz and all that stuff now!<br/>
I…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Rise really is a good actress and I kind of think she should reconsider quitting.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00137.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> I said before it was only a hiatus, but I've changed my mind! There's no way I'm coming back!<br/>
Souji sees the real me…<br/>
He's so gentle…!<br/>
&gt; Rise is desperate…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I played along, I'm a decent actor myself.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You went along with her story…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> S-See? I told you…<br/>
&gt; Rise looks relieved…<br/>
<b>Inoue:</b> ……<br/>
I understand. I'll go home… for today.<br/>
B-But I…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Go away! Now!<br/>
Oh… U-Ummm…<br/>
…That was Inoue-san. He was… my manager.<br/>
I'm his daughter's age, so he treated me like one of the family…<br/>
But… he's a stranger now.<br/>
……<br/>
S-Senpai, umm…<br/>
I'm sorry… Lying about marrying you and all…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I've got no problem helping out a friend in need, though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00157.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> Senpai…<br/>
You're so mature…<br/>
&gt; Rise smiled a smile of relief.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> You really are a nice guy.<br/>
Th-This isn't good… I feel like I'm going to depend on you even more…<br/>
…J-Just kidding!<br/>
&gt; Perhaps due to her relief, Rise is smiling sheepishly…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Rise has grown deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's hard to tell when Rise's acting and when she's not sometimes.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00166.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Rise.png"/> I wish I could spend more time with you, but… I'll save it for next time.<br/>
See you later, Senpai.<br/>
&gt; You watched Rise walk in and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dojima had something for me now that he was finally home.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00172.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> I heard you got top marks on that last exam.<br/>
Keeping up your studies while taking care of Nanako, too…? You're one hard working, aren't you?<br/>
I need to act like an uncle every so often and give you some spending money.<br/>
Here you go… A big tip.<br/>
But don't spend it all in… Nah, you can use it however you like.<br/>
&gt; You obtained 40000 yen from Dojima.<br/>
<br/>
<i>He seemed like he was busy with something, I decided to see what was up.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00185.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> It was there before…<br/>
Those damn kids… Don't they teach 'em how to file data anymore?<br/>
Oh… Sorry, I wasn't talking about you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Souji.png"/> Can I help?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> No… It's okay. Don't worry about it.<br/>
&gt; Dojima is smiling wryly.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> I was trying to find an old newspaper article… It was falling apart, so I made a copy, but…<br/>
The copy seems to have gone missing.<br/>
……<br/>
There's a certain case where we don't have a suspect yet…<br/>
And since the trail's going cold, it's about to be buried under newer cases.<br/>
But I can't give up on this one.<br/>
…Ever.<br/>
&gt; Dojima has a cornered look on his face…<br/>
&gt; This doesn't seem to be the time or the place to ask him more about it.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Just then Nanako came in. She wasn't feeling well.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00201.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> Hm? What's wrong?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Nanako.png"/> My stomach hurts…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> Was it something you ate!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Nanako.png"/> It feels like a sharp pain below my stomach.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> What!? I'll call the doc--<br/>
N-No, wait. This happened before. Is it the same feeling!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Nanako.png"/> I don't know…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> Urgh… Okay, the medicine we used before is-<br/>
Dammit! Who's calling at this time of night…?<br/>
Dojima here!<br/>
Adachi…? I'm hanging up.<br/>
…A sealed letter? For me?<br/>
Is it from Ichihara-san!? When did it come!?<br/>
You forgot!? Adachi…!<br/>
I'm on my way!<br/>
Gotta go. The medicine should be in the first aid kit… She's in your hands.<br/>
&gt; Dojima left…<br/>
&gt; You gave Nanako the medicine and put her to bed…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; A few hours later…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I had to find out what the hell was so important.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00222.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Dojima has come home.<br/>
&gt; He seems to be in a bad mood…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> Souji… You're still up?<br/>
It's late. Go to sleep.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Souji.png"/> Are you okay?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> Just shut up…<br/>
……<br/>
…Sorry.<br/>
&gt; Dojima looks apologetic…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> How's Nanako…?<br/>
She's sleeping… Good.<br/>
You've been a great help here.<br/>
&gt; Dojima seems to bear a heavy burden… What is he keeping locked up in his heart…?<br/>
&gt; You feel your bond with Dojima has deepened even further…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still have no idea. Still sort of pissed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00237.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> It's pretty late. Go hit the hay.<br/>
…'Night, Souji.<br/>
&gt; You said goodnight to Dojima and went to your room.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke's probably going to call me up tomorrow. Getting something done does have some appeal, I have to say.</i>
