<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yes, Ma'am! Visual ID confirmed!<br/>
Target arrived in-zone near the end of his mess break, with mother-issued rations in hand.<br/>
Current status: In the bathroom, fixing his hair.<br/>
The target was acting nervous. I left my position before he had a chance to pick on me!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> I wonder what kind of plans they made... It didn't seem like he knew that boy very well.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Well, I think there's something more subtle--<br/>
Oh, he's here!<br/>
<br/>
<i>They both showed up about the same time. Kanji's visitor came from outside the school, I noted.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> No, I-I just got here too...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Wh-What in the world was that...?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Oh, a-anyways! We gotta hurry after them, or we'll lose them!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Okay... Then let's split up into two groups. One team will follow Kanji, and the other will stake out the shop.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> R-Roger that! How should we split the teams?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yeah after all that mission impossible crap from earlier I'm not going with Chie or Yosuke.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Sure... that's fine with me.<br/>
Oh man, they're almost out of sight! C'mon, Yosuke!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> So, I'm pairing up with Chie...? Eh, okay.<br/>
Alright! We'll need to pretend we're on a date to make it look natural!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Not in a million years! There'll be no need for that if we stay out of sight.<br/>
Sheesh... Let's hurry up and go!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> I wonder if those two will be alright...<br/>
Oh... U-Um, that leaves us in charge of staking out the textile shop.<br/>
So... shall we?<br/>
<br/>
<i>So yeah, staking out textile shops is pretty boring it turns out.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Everything seems fine at the shop. I hope it stays that way...<br/>
Do you think the culprit will come...?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a possibility.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Then we need to keep our eyes open.<br/>
It would be scary if the culprit did show up...<br/>
But if they do, I'll do what I can to help you catch them.<br/>
You all saved my life... I don't want to be the only one doing nothing.<br/>
I mean... I'm sure there's something I can do...<br/>
Oh, sorry.<br/>
I went on and on without realizing... I-I guess I'm a little nervous.<br/>
I've never chatted with a boy my age like this before...<br/>
Chie, of course, has no problem getting along with guys because of her personality...<br/>
But I think she's had more fun hanging out with you and Yosuke lately.<br/>
......<br/>
...The same is true for me.<br/>
&gt; You sense Yukiko's gratitude and affection...<br/>
<br/>
<i>In a funny way, it seems like everyone's actually become stronger for facing their Shadows.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You haven't yet asked Yukiko for her contact information.<br/>
<br/>
<i>By the way balls status: none. I am greatly humiliated.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Oh, you're right. We'll need to contact each other if anything happens.<br/>
&gt; You exchanged cell numbers with Yukiko.<br/>
&gt; There seems to be no change over at the shop.<br/>
&gt; You spoke with Yukiko about many different things...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Meanwhile, at the same time...</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah... We definitely stand out.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> No, I mean THEM! I get this weird feeling about them...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Weird? What about them's weird?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Umm... I don't know how to put it...<br/>
Maybe it's just my imagination...<br/>
Hey, how do you think the others are doing?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Beats me. For all we know, he's hitting on Yukiko as we speak.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Yeaaaah, no. He's not like you.<br/>
Yukiko doesn't seem to be interested in that stuff anyway.<br/>
Wait... are you saying he's interested in her?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Huh!? Uh... I... wouldn't know...<br/>
We don't really talk about that kinda stuff... Hahahaha.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Now I'm even more suspicious! You know something, don't you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I-I seriously don't know! It's not like we've been hanging out that long, haha...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, well, you see... We're... We're just two crazy lovebirds!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Whaddya mean bird!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Play along, birdbrain!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Didn't I see you guys yesterday...?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> A-Ahahahaha...! C-C'mon, it just so happened that we were walking behind you guys. Pure coincidence!<br/>
Hey! Our houses are just over that way, so we'll be going now...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Um, look, we weren't planning on getting in you guys' way, and there's nothing strange about it, either...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> S-Strange...!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Why can't you keep your big mouth shut!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> W-Wait, dammit!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00082.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Hey! Are you listening, dammit!?<br/>
It seriously ain't like that!<br/>
<br/>
<i>So when Chie and Yosuke got back I was immediately happy I'd been at the shop.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00085.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> There was nowhere to hide.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Well... let's wait here a little longer. Maybe Kanji-kun will come home.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Huh...? What're you guys doing here?<br/>
You're those stupid lovebirds I just saw!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> We are not a couple!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> Why are you assholes followin' me around!?<br/>
Dammit, what the hell's going on!?<br/>
*sigh* I ain't sayin' this is you guys' fault...<br/>
But... Dammit...! *sigh*<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, uh... mind if we ask something? Has anything strange happened to you lately?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Note to self: Never say the word strange in front of Kanji.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00098.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> What's this "strange" stuff, huh!? Are you saying that I'm strange!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Huh? N-No, I didn't mean--!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> You shitheads better get the hell out of my face, or I'm taking you down!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Wha--!? Wait, why!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kanji.png"/> I look like I'm joking!?<br/>
&gt; You ran away from Kanji as fast as your legs would carry you...<br/>
<br/>
<i>God damn is he scary.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00105.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Well, nothing happened today, so I guess everything's okay...<br/>
But it's already been a few days since he appeared on the Midnight Channel.<br/>
If this is anything like Yukiko's case, it'll happen soon.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Then we can't let our guard down... I think we should come back tomorrow to check up on him.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Looks like we've got no choice...<br/>
Let's go home. I'm wiped...<br/>
<br/>
<i>It looks like it might rain again tonight, so at least we can keep checking the Midnight Channel.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Oh, hello? It's Yukio. I-I'm sorry to call so late.<br/>
Um, Kanji-kun seems to be missing!<br/>
I had some calls to make for the inn, so I called the textile shop as well.<br/>
When I spoke to Kanji-kun's mother...<br/>
She told me that he left the house and hasn't returned since.<br/>
She did say that this happens all the time, but... what do you think?<br/>
<br/>
<i>This is not good.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00120.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> I think so, too. He could be...<br/>
It's going to rain again tonight. Maybe the Midnight Channel will come on.<br/>
Then we'll know for sure if something happened to Kanji-kun or not.<br/>
I'll make sure to check out the TV at midnight... Talk to you later.<br/>
&gt; Yukiko hung up.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I waited up for the Midnight Channel, and it was bad news.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00129.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The image is clear and sharp.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Like seriously, BAD NEWS.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00131.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-ShadowKanji.png"/> Tonight, I'll introduce a superb site for those searching for sublime love that surpasses the separation of the sexes!<br/>
I'm your host, Kanji Tatsumi, serving you this scandalously special sneak-in report!<br/>
Goodness gracious, just imagine the things that might happen to me there! Ooooh!<br/>
Well then, let's get this show on the road! Tootaloo!<br/>
&gt; That was unmistakably Kanji...<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean what the fuck was that?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00137.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke was pretty freaked out too.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00139.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Huh? O-Oh yeah, you're right!<br/>
What in the world was that...?<br/>
But... Dammit, it's just what we were afraid of...<br/>
If only we'd held our ground and stayed there a little longer...<br/>
*sigh*<br/>
In any case, that place that was behind him... What do you think it is?<br/>
A "superb site for those searching for sublime love"? I just don't get it!<br/>
Anyways... We'd better hurry and come up with a plan tomorrow!<br/>
&gt; ...You decided to go to bed.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It sucks how close we must have gotten to the killer. But all we can do now is try to save Kanji. We'll start tomorrow...</i><br/>
