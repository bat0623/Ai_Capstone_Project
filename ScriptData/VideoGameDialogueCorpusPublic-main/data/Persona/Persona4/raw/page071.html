<i>I think exams are making Chie a bit philosophical.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> You know… Lately, whenever we're "over there," I've been wondering…<br/>
Does it feel like you've seen those Shadows before?<br/>
I mean, we've fought robots and stuff that look like they're right out of some anime, right?<br/>
Doesn't that bother you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> Now that you mention it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Remember how our other selves had those logos like a TV show?<br/>
Maybe it was like that for the same reason as to why the Shadows look like something from the TV.<br/>
Teddie said before that the other world is related to our minds somehow.<br/>
People who watch the Midnight Channel believe it's a TV show, and we treat that world as "something inside the TV"…<br/>
So maybe that's why…<br/>
Or is it simply because all of us have had our brains soaked in television since we were kids?<br/>
Hmmm… I guess I can't really deny that…<br/>
I can't help watching Hong Kong action movies whenever they're on TV…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Mrs. Nakayama is really bitter and horrible, just to point that out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mrs. Nakayama:</b> Why would anyone need to find a center of gravity in real life, anyway?<br/>
*sigh * It's soooo tiring coming up with stuff for the exams… All I wanna do is go home and play with my stocks.<br/>
Even one yen makes a difference in the world of stocks. So addicting, too… I gotta start saving more money!<br/>
Speaking of one yen… I've got an interesting fact for you.<br/>
Hmm… I'll pick on Satonaka-san! …Nah, Seta-kun!<br/>
How much do you think it costs to make a one-yen coin?<br/>
<br/>
<i>This was on TV a while ago when they were talking about government waste.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mrs. Nakayama:</b> Correct! It costs about two yen for every one-yen coin to be made!<br/>
It's so inefficient… By the way, the cost of making coins or bills decreases as the value increases.<br/>
Money isn't free, after all. I think I'll put this on the test that starts the day after tomorrow. Study hard!<br/>
<br/>
<i>It started raining in the afternoon. That Namatame guy just stands around town moping even when it's raining.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> I can only do my best…<br/>
This is all I can do for her… This is the least I can do…<br/>
<br/>
<i>No clue. Anyway, I told the fox that I solved the guy's fear of cats.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh, and Nanako went shopping, so I made some lunch for tomorrow.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; There is a variety of food inside.<br/>
&gt; Make lunch for tomorrow…?<br/>
&gt; Surprisingly…<br/>
&gt; You have the ingredients to make croquettes.<br/>
&gt; You decided to make croquettes.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You put flour, egg, then panko on the ingredients and…<br/>
&gt; How hot should the oil be?<br/>
<br/>
<i>You always do this on high heat.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; it's frying well…<br/>
&gt; Obtained Crispy Croquettes.<br/>
<br/>
<i>They're going to be good.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>10/13/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Midterms are starting tomorrow, as nobody can forget.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Lazy Student:</b> Ugh… Midterms start tomorrow… But I feel sooooo lazy…<br/>
I can't believe you're so hardcore about studying for the exams, Senpai.<br/>
Are you sure you're gonna need to know all this stuff in the future?<br/>
<b>Brisk Student:</b> Well, you probably won't.<br/>
By the way, would you not say the word "lazy" around me, especially this early in the morning?<br/>
<b>Lazy Student:</b> Whatever… After exams, we have the Culture Festival.<br/>
There are more first-year students this year, so the festival could be more fun than it was last year.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Culture Festival, eh? Could be interesting, yeah. Anyway, I decided to eat my lunch with Rise.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You ate lunch with Rise.<br/>
&gt; You ate Crispy Croquettes together.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Rise.png"/> Mmm, good stuff! You're a culinary genius, Souji-senpai!<br/>
I've eaten a lot of things working in showbiz, but yours is the best!<br/>
Thanks for the lunch, Senpai.<br/>
That hit the spot!<br/>
&gt; It was Rise's favorite!<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's funny because Kashiwagi is terrible but still less creepy than some of the faculty here.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00076.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kashiwagi.png"/> I won't say who, but isn't that just wrong? I mean…<br/>
Who cares about a high school girl's measurements? It would've been much more interesting if they were mine, huh?<br/>
Organic species grow because it's necessary for both survival and reproduction.<br/>
You could say the same thing about the cute little plants, too.<br/>
Hmm… I'll pick Souji-kun since our eyes just met.<br/>
What happens to plants when you touch them?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I wasn't even sure this was true but it's what they always say.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00083.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kashiwagi.png"/> *chuckle * Correct. You're trying to think from inside the plant's shoes, right?<br/>
When plants feel pressure from an outside source, they discharge a hormone that regulates their growth.<br/>
Hence, by talking to or petting a plant, it'll bloom flowers quicker than usual.<br/>
This process is called thigmomorphogenesis. Maybe humans work the same way… *giggle *<br/>
I want you to remember that, so I'll be putting it on the test that starts tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
<i>The fox had a new request, written as a haiku.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00091.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Ema:</b> I wish my wallet would return.<br/>
<br/>
<i>And I found the woman who'd written it around town. It was pretty obvious as soon as I talked to her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00097.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Woman:</b> I'm done for… I'm so hungdy, I'm seeing illusions… Aren't you handsome…<br/>
…O-Oh, I'm sorry. You actually are handsome. Ahahaha…<br/>
……<br/>
I lost my wallet the other day.<br/>
I can't find it anywhere…<br/>
My entire fortune… Even my seal… It was all in there.<br/>
How unlucky must I be…<br/>
My luck has left me, I really wish I had food. How my stomach growls…<br/>
*sigh * I made another haiku…<br/>
&gt; The woman smiles and stares off into the distance.<br/>
&gt; Perhaps she's the one who wrote the ema request the fox showed you.<br/>
&gt; She wants to get back the money she lost.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I talked to her again to see if she had any idea where she might have lost it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00110.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Wallet Misplacer:</b> Withering, no food/memories of days gone by,/rejected kind words./O, why did I deny you?/Another stupid mistake.<br/>
*sigh * I made another tanka…<br/>
&gt; The woman smiles and stares off into the distance.<br/>
<b>Wallet Misplacer:</b> Where did I lose that darn thing…? If I wasn't so hungry, I'd search every nook and cranny…<br/>
Maybe I lost it by the river?<br/>
Those rocks look like they're hiding bugs… …Maybe they're edible.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Down by the river, I did indeed find a wallet.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00119.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It's a wallet.<br/>
&gt; Obtained Round Wallet.<br/>
<br/>
<i>But it wasn't quite right.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00122.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Wallet Misplacer:</b> ……<br/>
Some people have said:/"Prosperity is fleeting."/It is very true./I should be happy right now,/However I am dismayed.<br/>
Haha, thank you for your hard work… But sadly, that wallet isn't mine.<br/>
……<br/>
Get that wallet away from me! I'm fighting the urge to take it with all my will!<br/>
If I take that money and eat, my conscience will just drive me crazy!<br/>
&gt; It seems the wallet you found at Samegawa isn't this woman's…<br/>
<b>Wallet Misplacer:</b> It's no use. I give up.<br/>
In order to feed my hungry kid brother, I'm gonna go work in the city…<br/>
In the turbulent neon sea, I'll wander the dangerous streets…<br/>
Tears and memories/within my pulsating heart;/I must now set sail./I'll sadly voyage afar;/O wind, see me off nobly.<br/>
So long, Inaba… I loved you so.<br/>
&gt; The woman has completely given up…<br/>
&gt; You wish you could find it for her…<br/>
&gt; Perhaps looking in other locations will prove fruitful.<br/>
<b>Wallet Misplacer:</b> *sigh *<br/>
Maybe I dropped it when I went to check out the field… That scrooge, he coulda let me have one.<br/>
Isn't that land part of the shrine, anyway?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I headed back to the shrine to check the field near there.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It's a wallet.<br/>
&gt; Obtained Square Wallet.<br/>
<br/>
<i>She was still by the river fortunately.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00145.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Wallet Misplacer:</b> I was too worried about leaving my brother…<br/>
Inaba city Is far from being peaceful. Woe is Inaba…<br/>
…I guess I'll find a side job here.<br/>
*sigh * If only I had my wallet…<br/>
…That! In your hands! That that that that!!<br/>
That's my wallet! You found it for me!?<br/>
&gt; You gave the woman her wallet.<br/>
&gt; She's frantically checking inside…<br/>
<b>Wallet Misplacer:</b> Th-This is it! My precious wallet!<br/>
My seal! My contract and deed, they're all here!<br/>
Hooray! Now I can go back to buying up plots of land!<br/>
The land of others/If I want, it is my land/Happens in a flash/That is the law of the world./It is my world, my way.<br/>
…I'm short one syllable. Maybe I've lost my knack for tanka. I'll just stick to composing haiku.<br/>
Thank you so much! Oh, yeah! I need to go say thanks to the shrine, too!<br/>
<br/>
<i>After that I ran into Kanji, who had finished what he was working on for that kid.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00163.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It seems Kanji called the boy here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> Here.<br/>
&gt; Kanji placed a bunch of knit dolls on the table…<br/>
&gt; Each one with different clothing and accessories…<br/>
&gt; They're… very elaborate.<br/>
<b>Doll Boy:</b> I can have these!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> Y-Yeah. If you don't need 'em, I guess you could just toss…<br/>
<b>Doll Boy:</b> Thank you!!<br/>
Oh, yeah! Mom said…<br/>
You should at least be paid for the materials… She gave me some money.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> I-I said I don't need it!<br/>
I look like I'm in this for the money to you!?<br/>
<b>Doll Boy:</b> Mister, you're from Tatsumi Textiles, right?<br/>
Oh, uh, nothing!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We heard a familiar voice just then.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00178.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Nanako.png"/> Ooh, dolls! These are so cute!!<br/>
What are these!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> Uh, well…<br/>
<b>Doll Boy:</b> This man made them!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Nanako.png"/> That's amazing! You're really good!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> She looked straight at me when he said "this man"…<br/>
H-Hey, Nanako-chan…<br/>
Don't go around telling everyone, okay? It's kinda embarrassing…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Nanako.png"/> Why? I think it's cool you can make things like this.<br/>
I want to learn how to make them, too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> Oh… Well, maybe next time…<br/>
That okay with you, "big bro"?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> Yeah, go ahead.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> For… For reals…?<br/>
Er, I-I ain't that good at teaching…<br/>
&gt; Kanji is panicking…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Nanako.png"/> Oh, I as on my way to Emi-chan's house!<br/>
Teach me next time! Bye!<br/>
<b>Doll Boy:</b> I'm going to show these to Mom!<br/>
Thank you, Mister!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>They both left, leaving us alone.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00199.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> About what "strength" really means.<br/>
I used to think it was doing what needed to be done, like a man…<br/>
So I thought for me, that was catching this damn killer. And I mean, that's important too, but…<br/>
There's something else I gotta confront too, ain't there?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> Your past.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> My past…<br/>
Yeah. I still ain't snapped out of it.<br/>
The stuff that "other me" said inside the TV world… That girl I made cry a long time ago…<br/>
I haven't gotten past any of it…<br/>
&gt; Kanji is muttering to himself…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> It ain't that easy to become strong, is it…?<br/>
&gt; Kanji is looking far into the distance with a relieved look on his face…<br/>
&gt; His face shines with a gentleness you've never seen before from him…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still, he's taking the first step now.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00214.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kanji.png"/> I'm takin' off.<br/>
Mom saw the stuff I made… She's been hassling me about selling 'em at the shop.<br/>
The hell's a textile shop gonna do with stuff that's already been knit?<br/>
&gt; Despite his words, Kanji seems happily embarrassed…<br/>
&gt; You parted with Kanji and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Exams start tomorrow. I'm not worried, though, they were easy last time.</i>
