<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I still can't believe it… Our homeroom teacher was killed.<br/>
I… couldn't get that much sleep yesterday.<br/>
How about you? Are you alright?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> I'm okay.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Well… If we start getting depressed over something like this, we'll never catch the killer, huh?<br/>
Hmm… Oh, yeah… This means we'll be getting a new homeroom teacher.<br/>
I wonder who it'll be…<br/>
…Well, I'm pretty sure that they won't be able to find anyone worse than King Moron.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke was wrong, as he so often is.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Male Student:</b> Hey, is that stuff about King Moron for real?<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> It was on TV, right? It must be true.<br/>
<br/>
<i>He was oh so wrong.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kashiwagi.png"/> I'm Noriko Kashiwagi, your new class teacher starting today.<br/>
You all probably know already, but now that Mr. Morooka has passed away…<br/>
I'll be taking good care of you instead. *giggle *<br/>
Okay, why don't we start off with a moment of silence for Mr. Morooka.<br/>
Close your eyes, everyone…<br/>
That should be good enough.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Creepy lady was sitting up on the desk when we opened our eyes.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kashiwagi.png"/> So our regular exams are still on track for next week.<br/>
As your principal said, "It's times like these when the schedule is most important, Nori-chan."<br/>
*giggle * It must be tough for you.<br/>
But that's what it means to become an adult, little by little.<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> I already can't stand her…<br/>
<b>Male Student:</b> First King Moron and now Kashiwagi…? How much worse can it get?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kashiwagi.png"/> Oh, and one more thing.<br/>
That idol in our first-year class… Ms. Kujikawa, was it?<br/>
In person, she's nothing like she seems on TV, so don't get your hopes up, mmkay?<br/>
What's so great about an idol anyway, right class? She's just a piece of inexperienced jailbait.<br/>
&gt; Ms. Kashiwagi is ranting on and on…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Seriously what a freak.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Student's Friend:</b> She doesn't stand a chance against Risette. I mean, I heard Kashiwagi is on the wrong side of 40…<br/>
&gt; You can hear your classmates gossiping…<br/>
<b>Brown-Haired Student:</b> I bet King Moron would've been ecstatic to hear Risette had enrolled here.<br/>
Someone told me they saw him buying Rise's pinup book…<br/>
<b>Student's Friend:</b> That sounds kinda pervy.<br/>
He annoyed the hell out of me, but I feel bad that he got killed…<br/>
<b>Brown-Haired Student:</b> Oh, you know what? Risette was on a striptease show.<br/>
<b>Student's Friend:</b> Huh? A striptease!? Dude, if that was true, the paparazzi would've been all over it.<br/>
<b>Brown-Haired Student:</b> I'm serious! But the reception went bad right when it was getting to the good part…<br/>
It was on that Midnight Channel everyone keeps talking about.<br/>
<b>Student's Friend:</b> You actually believe that crap? How friggin' dense are you?<br/>
Trust me, you were dreaming it…<br/>
<br/>
<i>If more people really are watching the Midnight Channel this could get even worse.</i><br/>
<br/>
 <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> We'd better wrap this case up quick.<br/>
Anyways, let's meet up later. Don't make any plans for this afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We went down to Junes as usual.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> It's been a while since I failed any subjects…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, if by "a while" you mean "all the time."<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> Sh-Shut up! Like you've ever seen my scores!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Yukiko.png"/> But Chie always has above-average marks in the subjects that she doesn't fail!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> H-Hey! Why'd you tell him!? My scores just… vary! Yeah, that's it!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Rise.png"/> Ahaha!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> R-Rise-chan, you too…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Rise.png"/> *giggle * Sorry… I'm not laughing at you.<br/>
It's just… I thought it would take me a while to make any friends at my new school.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> Too bad we met under such awful circumstances.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Oh yeah… What do you guys think about King Moron's case?<br/>
He didn't show up on the Midnight Channel even once.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Teddie2.png"/> If this person had been inside the TV, I would've sensed it.<br/>
My nose isn't as sharp now, but I can tell that much.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> But they found the body on a foggy day again, right?<br/>
They said on the news that that crime scene was just the way it was for that announcer and Saki-senpai.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Yukiko.png"/> I really wonder about the culprit's motives… Why was Mr. Morooka targeted?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kanji had a really good point.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Rise.png"/> But didn't you say it's people who get famous on TV who are targeted?<br/>
If the killer's choosing targets by watching TV, I picture him as someone who doesn't know the victims at all.<br/>
I don't think it's worth trying to figure out motives for that type.<br/>
There are too many people who hold grudges against you for no reason, even if you've never met them before.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> Haha… You sound like you speak from experience, Rise-chan…<br/>
But with King Moron, he didn't appear on the Midnight Channel or the regular TV…<br/>
Uurgh! I don't get this at all!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Kanji.png"/> Man, two victims in a row from our school…<br/>
That's gotta set off the police's alarm bells. They're not gonna leave any stones at school unturned.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Y'know, to be honest…<br/>
Somewhere deep inside, I thought maybe King Moron was the killer…<br/>
The news says that he was the second victim from Yasogami High, but we all know that's not the case.<br/>
And I've heard him say more than once that so-and-so deserves to die…<br/>
But now… I feel bad that I doubted him.<br/>
He was a capital-A asshole, but that doesn't justify killing him…<br/>
And not just King Moron… I feel sorry for all the victims…<br/>
I can't forgive the killer, no matter what!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> Well, we'll do what we can, for King Moron's sake too!<br/>
At this rate, you have to figure that the killer has something to do with the school, right?<br/>
So why don't we split up and-<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was about then that we were interrupted.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00089.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Kanji.png"/> Y-You…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> There is no need to examine the case of Mr. Morooka any further.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> Wh-Why's that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> Apparently, the police has found a suspect. It would be best to let them handle the case from here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> H-How do you know…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> I'm on this case as a special investigator, by request of the prefectural police.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> What!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> They found a suspect…!? Who is it!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> As to his name, I haven't been informed.<br/>
I do know… that he is a high schooler.<br/>
It isn't public knowledge yet, but he isn't a student of your high school.<br/>
It seems they are quite confident that this boy is the killer…<br/>
They have testimonies directly linking him with the incident.<br/>
I expect it's only a matter of time before he is apprehended.<br/>
Soon, this case will be solved, and your town will once again be its peaceful, rustic self.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> The suspect… is a high schooler…?<br/>
All right… So why come tell us?<br/>
That's confidential info, right? Why run right here and spill it?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> Your "game" will soon reach its end.<br/>
I felt I should at least let you know that.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't know what Naoto's problem is but this sure as hell isn't a game to us.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00110.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> You don't deny, then, that you have involved yourselves in the matter?<br/>
Well, no matter. I have no reason to say anything further.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Rise.png"/> A game…?<br/>
Aren't you the one who thinks of this as a game?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> ……!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Rise.png"/> I don't care if you're a special investigator or an amateur sleuth… All you're doing is solving mysteries.<br/>
What could you possibly know about us? You're the one who's playing a game here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> One of the victims… She meant a lot to me. How could I possibly treat this like a game?<br/>
Plus…<br/>
We made a promise…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Teddie2.png"/> Y-Y-Yosuke…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> A game…<br/>
That may be quite true…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> Wh-Why so understanding all of a sudden…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, I get it. I was wondering why you'd be wandering around like this when the police have a suspect…<br/>
What, did they get rid of you now that they have their man? Is that why you came here? You were lonely?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> Detectives normally aren't involved with arrests. And we never harbor any special emotions regarding a case, either.<br/>
Still…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I know Dojima wasn't happy about Naoto's presence, can't imagine the others were either.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00130.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> But then, I'm accustomed to it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Kanji.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> Much about this case was perplexing, but its solution was surprisingly simple…<br/>
 Well then, I'll be going now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> What was that about…? He just said his piece and left…?<br/>
……<br/>
He said they have a suspect… but is this really gonna solve everything?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> *sigh * Who knows…<br/>
&gt; …You all decided to call it a day.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Even if the police have a suspect, how can they possibly catch a guy who has our powers? We can't give up now.</i>
