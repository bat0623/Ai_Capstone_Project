			<b>7/8/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>It rained today, so I headed to give the fox some good news.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Nanako had a question for me when I got home.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Nanako.png"/> …Why do people die?<br/>
&gt; Is Nanako talking about her mother, who died in an accident?<br/>
&gt; Nanako is looking straight at you…<br/>
&gt; This is a difficult question for a girl Nanako's age to understand…<br/>
&gt; But, with your level of expression, you were able to explain it to her.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Nanako.png"/> I see… This is hard…<br/>
But I get it! Thank you, big bro!<br/>
&gt; Nanako is nodding her head cheerfully.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Souji.png"/> Is there anything else?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Nanako.png"/> Well, ummm… Oh, there is!<br/>
&gt; Nanako's eyes are gleaming…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Nanako.png"/> What happens to a person.. when they die?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't know myself, but that's not what a kid who's lost their mother needs to hear.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Nanako.png"/> So, it is true. Mommy went to heaven.<br/>
&gt; Nanako is smiling happily…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Nanako.png"/> Oh, yeah, I saw this on the news: "Robbery at the post office."<br/>
……<br/>
Why do bad people do bad things?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Souji.png"/> I don't know.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Nanako.png"/> I see… You're not a bad person, so I guess you wouldn't know.<br/>
&gt; Nanako looks relieved.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Nanako.png"/> But if there were no bad people, Dad would be home more…<br/>
Last year, there weren't many crimes, so Dad was here a lot.<br/>
He used to pick me up from kindergarten…<br/>
……<br/>
Are bad people more important to Dad than I am?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dojima's… complicated. But I know there's nobody more important to him than Nanako.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Nanako.png"/> …I don't get it.<br/>
&gt; Nanako is thinking.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Nanako.png"/> ……<br/>
&gt; It seems that Nanako is bearing her sadness stoically…<br/>
&gt; You feel that you understand a bit of Nanako's loneliness…<br/>
<br/>
<i>If we manage to stop the killer, that'll also mean Dojima can be home more. Just one more reason to bring the bastard down.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Nanako.png"/> …Let's talk about something else, big bro.<br/>
&gt; You decided to talk about something different with the lonely-looking Nanako…<br/>
&gt; It's getting late, so you put Nanako to bed and went to your own room.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's still raining tonight, and it looks like it's going to keep going tomorrow.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>7/9/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Another day, another wish from the fox.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I headed down for my traditional celebratory Aiya bowl, then went home. Looks like the fog is coming.</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>Weather Announcer:</b> The week ended on a wet note as rain clouds moved into the area.<br/>
As a result, a thick fog is expected to form in the Inaba region later tonight…<br/>
&gt; it seems the fog will set in tonight…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Also if Nanako is reading this it was Dojima that stole your pudding and not me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; There's a bowl of homemade pudding!<br/>
&gt; …Nanako's name is written on the bottom of the container.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; Eat Nanako's pudding…?<br/>
&gt; …<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; ………<br/>
&gt; Stolen food always tastes good… But you do feel guilty about it.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Soon enough midnight came.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The fog has set in…<br/>
&gt; No one is appearing on the Midnight Channel.<br/>
&gt; Since Rise has been rescued, it seems the killer was thwarted this time…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Why do I have this terrible feeling? We saved Rise, the Midnight Channel is blank. What could happen?</i><br/>

<br/>
&gt; Did something happen…?<br/>
&gt; You cell phone is ringing.<br/>
&gt; It's from Chie.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> D-D-Did you hear yet!?<br/>
They found a dead body just outside the shopping district!<br/>
I don't get it! I mean, we…<br/>
Look, we're all meeting at Junes. Come over right away!<br/>
&gt; Chie hung up.<br/>
&gt; You're sure that you rescued Rise…<br/>
&gt; …It would be best if you hurried to Junes.<br/>
<br/>
<i>How could this have happened?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00089.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Yosuke went over to check out the scene. He should be back soon…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> *gasp * Yeah, it was murder all right.<br/>
The body was hanging upside down on an apartment's rooftop railing…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> But… how could that…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> That's not all.<br/>
The victim this time…<br/>
<br/>
<i>How could we have been so wrong?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00096.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> K-King Moron…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kanji.png"/> You mean THAT King Moron!? Senpai's homeroom teacher?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Wh-Why…!?<br/>
What on earth's going on here!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> How am I supposed to know!? But I talked to a guy there who saw it!<br/>
It's true… There's no mistake.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kanji.png"/> Gotta be shitting me… Ain't the killer targeting people who get shown on TV?<br/>
I ain't never seen King Moron on the Midnight Channel, or any other programs!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Why…? Why did this happen?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> I thought we finally figured some things out… Were they all just a big coincidence…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Maybe the Midnight Channel doesn't have anything to do with this…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Dammit! We came so far, and now we're back to square one!?<br/>
Were we in over our heads, trying to catch a culprit that even the police couldn't find…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>But it doesn't matter. Even if we've been wrong the whole time we need to keep trying.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00110.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kanji.png"/> Damn straight!<br/>
We started this thing 'cause the police can't tell their asses from their elbows.<br/>
We give up now, and that shithead's gonna be on the loose forever.<br/>
This ain't the time for bitching and moaning… We just gotta keep on keepin' on.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Kanji-kun…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Hmph… Big talk from someone like you, Kanji.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kanji.png"/> Wh-What's that s'posedta mean!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> *sigh * I know…<br/>
We're dealing with a murderer here. But we've all risked our lives to get this far…<br/>
No way we'll back down.<br/>
And we promised the bear, too…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Hey, that's right! Maybe Teddie knows something about this!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Well, since moping around won't do us any good, let's go see him!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed to the electronics department and got another surprise.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Now that's unusual…<br/>
Hi there. Did something happen?<br/>
<b>Female Employee:</b> Ah, Yosuke-kun.<br/>
<b>Male Employee:</b> Great timing. Did the manager tell you anything about this?<br/>
There's been this weird mascot around our department for quite a while now…<br/>
Is there some kind of campaign on today?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Mascot…?<br/>
<b>Female Employee:</b> He said his name was… Uh, what was it? Terry? Eddie?<br/>
<b>Male Employee:</b> Well, there are no customers around, so I guess it's fine… I better get back to my station.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Please don't tell me…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Whoa, h-he's here!<br/>
<br/>
<i>And indeed, Teddie was there. At Junes. In the real world.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00136.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Wh-What the…? I mean, how'd you…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> It took you guys long enough! I've been waiting.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Teddie, are you okay on this side!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kanji.png"/> How did you even leave your side!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> Of course I can come out. There's an exit.<br/>
It just never occurred to me to do it before.<br/>
But spending time with you all sparked my curiosity about this world!<br/>
I did wonder if it was a good idea, but my feel started moving before I could decide.<br/>
And when I thought about it, I had nowhere to go, and it was a waste to go back. So I waited here for you.<br/>
Oh, someone asked for my name. So I told them, "I'm Teddie."<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> So that's why…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Oh yeah, there's something we need to ask you!<br/>
How long have you been here, Teddie? Did anyone enter the other world?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> I stayed until the fog settled in on my side, but no one came.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> You're positive? You really didn't sense a single person?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> I just said that I didn't! I was there all by myself, like always. Hmph!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> And your nose wasn't clogged or anything…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> Grrr, aren't you listening!? I was utterly, totally, and 100% alone! That's why I came over here!<br/>
But I can understand if you don't believe me. My senses aren't that good lately anyways…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still I think we can trust that Teddie's doing his best.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00156.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> Oh! Sensei's heart is radiating pure kindness…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Well, it's true that the Midnight Channel was blank last night.<br/>
And even before that… Teddie says he didn't sense anything, right?<br/>
Does that mean… King Moron was never on that side?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Hmm… What's going on?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> Hey, hey, I wanna go somewhere!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kanji.png"/> Huh? Now ain't the time, dude… You seriously don't plan on going back, do you?<br/>
Where do you wanna go, anyway?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> I want to give this to Rise-chan. It's for her.<br/>
&gt; You received glasses from Teddie.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> Rise-chan will probably back us up from now on!<br/>
So I'm gonna fight alongside you with everything I got!<br/>
Don't think of me as the same cute little Teddie!<br/>
I'm an all-new model! I have a powerful attack, an unbeatable defense, and a winning smile!<br/>
Today begins the New Legend of Teddie!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Wow… A new legend…<br/>
&gt; …Teddie has joined the group as a front line fighter!<br/>
&gt; He'll definitely be a strong asset in your battle against the Shadows.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Even if things are looking down, we're stronger than ever.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00175.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Uh-oh, people are starting to stare… Keep it down, willya Ted!?<br/>
C'mon, let's go somewhere else!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed down to the food court.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00180.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Nobody was over there, except for you, until the fog came back. Correct?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> That's what I've been saying.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> He didn't show up on the Midnight Channel either…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kanji.png"/> What's up with that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> No clue…<br/>
But I think we can be sure now that King Moron was never thrown into the TV.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Then what, he was killed over here?<br/>
Why not throw him into a TV, like all the rest?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Clearly the killer had some special reason to kill Morooka.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00189.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> They never intended to…?<br/>
So you're saying he wasn't like the other victims to begin with? But why?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Maybe the culprit thought he couldn't kill any more people by throwing them into TVs.<br/>
I mean, we prevented his last three attempts in a row.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Ahhh, I get you… That could be it!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kanji.png"/> So they snuffed someone on our side this time to make sure it worked.<br/>
Dammit… If that's true, then we have no way of preventing more murders unless we catch the killer!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> We need more clues…<br/>
I wonder if Rise-chan's up and around yet.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah… We'll have to put our hopes on her.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> *sigh * It's so hot out.<br/>
…I'm taking this off.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Wait, you're not talking about your head, are you!?<br/>
Cut it out! There's kids watching!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Geez… They'll be scarred for life if they see an empty mascot walking around. Have a little consideration, man.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> I'm glad you're back to normal, though. Your fur's all fuzzy again!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kanji.png"/> C-Can I feel it…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> No!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We weren't exactly sure what Teddie was talking about here at the time.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00208.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> I trained and trained, hoping to someday score with Chie-chan and Yuki-chan… And now I finally have an inside!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Yeah… good job with that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Come on! Can't we give it a rest with the whole "scoring" thing?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Dude, you're hollow. Taking your head off isn't gonna cool you down!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> But I just told you! I'm not hollow anymore!<br/>
Agh, it's too hot. I can't stand it…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And then we found out exactly what he meant.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Y-Yes…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Teddie2.png"/> Do you have anything to wear? I'm basically like a newborn at the moment…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> T-Teddie? Is that really you…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Umm…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Wait, did you say you're like a newborn!?<br/>
Then don't take the bottom part off!<br/>
You need some clothes, right? C'mon, let's go look around…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kanji.png"/> That's… Teddie…?<br/>
He said he's not hollow anymore… So, like… he grew himself a body in there?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> What kinda creature would do that!?<br/>
I mean… what IS he?<br/>
……<br/>
*sigh * Then again, this is hardly the first bizarre thing we've seen…<br/>
And I gotta admit, it's probably better than him walking around in his bear suit.<br/>
Oh, hey, weren't we gonna see about talking to Rise?<br/>
I was so shocked that I lost track of what we were talking about.<br/>
Let's head over to Rise's place. As for Teddie… He's with the girls, so he should be fine.<br/>
&gt; You went home to change before heading to the shopping district…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We decided to wait for the girls and Teddie, so we stopped for some Topsicles first.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Dude, how many are you going to eat? You're gonna get a stomach ache.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> *gasp * Sorry we're late…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> How'd it take you that long to find clothes for Ted?<br/>
Whoa…! I-Is that you, Teddie…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Teddie2.png"/> Oui, monsieur! How do I look?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I had to run with it.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Uh, don't encourage him.<br/>
I have to say, it totally blew my mind, but he's Teddie alright.<br/>
This guy had to make it a huge ordeal… Everything was new to him, so it turned into a big mess.<br/>
He was so excited in the women's section that he started blabbering…<br/>
Hey, you can't just go around doing whatever you please when you're in this form, got it?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Well, he can't help it. It's his first time in our world.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> *sigh * All right… You don't need to get all mopey like that.<br/>
I never said I won't forgive you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Teddie2.png"/> I'm so glad! I was worried that you didn't like me anymore.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> *chuckle * Man… If you can behave yourself, you'll be pretty cute.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Is he cute…? What do you think, Kanji?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kanji.png"/> Huh? What're you asking me for?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Well, I was just wondering if he was your type.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kanji.png"/> Ohhh… I get it.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kanji's not taking shit from Yosuke anymore, which I think is good.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Snrk… *chuckle *<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> S-Sorr-heehee…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> You'll have to forgive Yukiko. She's helpless once she gets this way…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Teddie2.png"/> Oooh, please, everyone! Don't fight over me, baby!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kanji.png"/> Shuddup! You picking a fight with me!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Ahahahahahaha!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Geez… oh well.<br/>
&gt; Yosuke handed a 1,000-yen bill to Kanji.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Here, Kanji. Get whatever ice cream you wan, just share it with Teddie.<br/>
We're gonna head for the tofu shop. Wait here until we get back.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Teddie2.png"/> Wow, you're rich!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kanji.png"/> I can't just take this from you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Think of it as a welcome-back party for Teddie.<br/>
Just don't go around making a racket.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Whoa, Yosuke, what's gotten into you? You're acting like a real senpai all of a sudden.<br/>
Oh, I get it. You might say differently, but you're still nice to Teddie.<br/>
I'm glad Yosuke's developing into such a mature adult. Someone who doesn't let trifles bother him.<br/>
<br/>
<i>This was going in a direction that I could already tell was going to be hilarious if you weren't Yosuke.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-P4-00281.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Oh, it's about Teddie's clothes, that's all. We didn't have the money for them, so we charged the rest to you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Charge?<br/>
WHAT!? You put it on my account!? What the hell, Chie!? I never said you could do that!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> What else were we supposed to do!? This stuff was expensive, even for Junes!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> You seriously charged it to me?<br/>
Wh-Why would you do that!? You know I've been saving up to buy a motorcycle!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Oh, that. You don't need one.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> What!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Teddie2.png"/> C'mon baby. Stop fighting over-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Shuddup! This is your fault, y'know!<br/>
Grrrrr…<br/>
You listen here, Ted… You better take really, really, REALLY good care of that.<br/>
If you put even a single tear in it, I'll make your next set of clothes out of the bear hide you took off!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kanji.png"/> Yo Teddie, don't let it get you down.<br/>
Let's go get some Topsicles.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Let's go on ahead… I think they're going to be a while.<br/>
<br/>
<i>That person Kanji had been talking with was already at Rise's.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-P4-00299.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> You're…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Naoto.png"/> Are you here to ingratiate yourself with Rise Kujikawa now?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Geez… Why did the clerk even let them charge it to someone else…?<br/>
Huh? W-Wait, you're that guy we saw with Kanji…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Naoto.png"/> Precisely. I don't believe we've met since then-In fact, I don't believe I've ever introduced myself.<br/>
My name is Naoto Shirogane. I'm investigating the multiple murders that have occurred here.<br/>
Mind if I ask you a few questions on the subject?<br/>
The latest victim, Kinshiro Morooka… He was a teacher at the school you all attend, correct?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> S-So what?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Naoto.png"/> The public is focused on the fact that he is associated with the second victim's school… But in truth, that's irrelevant.<br/>
What intrigues me is the inconsistency.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't know who this Naoto Shirogane is but I'm damn impressed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-P4-00311.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Naoto.png"/> What do you make of that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> …How are we supposed to know?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Naoto.png"/> Well, we'll leave it at that.<br/>
For my part, I'd like to solve this case as quickly as possible.<br/>
I'll be keeping an eye on you all.<br/>
Well then, until we meet again.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Who is that guy…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> It felt like he completely saw through us… He even knew about the TV thing.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Before we could continue on, Rise showed up.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-P4-00320.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Rise-chan!<br/>
Are you okay now…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Good, good…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Rise.png"/> Are you all here to check up on me?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Well, yeah…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Rise.png"/> Oh, um… Do you guys have a moment?<br/>
There's something I want to tell you.<br/>
Follow me. My grandma's taking care of the shop today.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Huh? Sure, okay…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We went to the shrine with Rise.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Rise.png"/> When I came to, though, I was already in the other world.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Still no real information on the killer…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> We met this weird kid named Naoto a second ago…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Rise.png"/> Oh… He's come to the shop several times. He asked me a lot about the incident.<br/>
I didn't tell him anything about the other world, though. I figured it'd be a waste of time.<br/>
Actually, he asked me about you guys too, but I just made up some stuff.<br/>
Like, "They found me unconscious on the roof at Junes."<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Well, I guess that's close enough to the truth.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Rise.png"/> Um… So…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Hm…? What's up?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Rise.png"/> Um…<br/>
I-I really appreciate what you did for me…<br/>
Thank you soooo much! I love you guys!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Huh…? Awww, you don't have to thank us!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Dude… She's so cute…<br/>
Man, it's finally hitting me that you're the real deal. You really are Risette.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was good to see that she was feeling better, I have to say.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-P4-00348.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Rise.png"/> Do I… sound weird?<br/>
Oh, but I guess it sounds more "natural" this way to the public…<br/>
I'm sorry… I've practically lost touch with what the normal me is like.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Haha, no need to apologize. Just do what comes naturally.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> I think everyone has multiple sides to them. You don't have to force yourself to decide on just one.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Haha, it sounds convincing when Yukiko says it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Huh…? R-Really?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Rise.png"/> ……<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
*chuckle * I'm glad you're the first people I got to know here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> Oh yeah, we almost forgot your present. The Teddie Glasses.<br/>
Um, you don't have to take them, but… Well…<br/>
&gt; Teddie gave you a pair of glasses to hold onto for when Rise joined you.<br/>
&gt; But what you should say when giving them to her…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Rise.png"/> Senpai… Would you be struggling without my help?<br/>
I can help you in that world, right?<br/>
With my power…<br/>
So wouldn't it be better if I joined the team?<br/>
<br/>
<i>It seems I didn't even need to ask her to join.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-P4-00367.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> These are kinda proof that you're one of us…<br/>
&gt; You explained the effect of the glasses to Rise.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Rise.png"/> I see… I do remember you all wearing glasses over there.<br/>
Thanks, Senpai. Now I'm part of the team, too!<br/>
&gt; Rise Kujikawa joined the group!<br/>
&gt; She'll definitely be a strong asset in solving the case.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think Rise's powers are much stronger than Teddie's ever were, so we'll be in even better shape now.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-P4-00374.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Rise.png"/> I'll be going to Yasogami High, starting tomorrow.<br/>
But I don't have any friends yet, so don't ignore me, alright?<br/>
I do owe you my life, so… you know…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Souji.png"/> Leave it to me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Rise.png"/> W-Wow… I didn't realize you were so cool, Senpai.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> This sure is a rough time to transfer here, though.<br/>
The kidnappings, King Moron's death… All that, and exams are soon, too.<br/>
*sigh * Exams… Now I'm depressing myself. I wonder if there's any chance they'll be cancelled…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Chie.png"/> I doubt it. They always hold exams, rain or shine…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Rise.png"/> *chuckle * I almost got killed by those monsters. Compared to that, exams are nothing.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Alrighty then, let's discuss the case some more tomorrow at our special headquarters.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kanji.png"/> Yo. How's it going?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kanji had some incredible news.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-P4-00390.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kanji.png"/> Though if you count the ones I had before, that makes six, so I still win.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> No one asked…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Rise.png"/> We're all done talking already!<br/>
Let's go, Senpai!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kanji.png"/> Uh… When did you get so chipper?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Rise.png"/> Do you go to Yasogami, like Senpai? I'll be starting school there tomorrow, so I hope we get along too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kanji.png"/> Huh? Oh… cool.<br/>
Uhh… What grade are you in?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> …Snrk.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> So where's Teddie?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kanji.png"/> He's over there, finishing up his fifth Topsicle. What are we gonna do with him?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Yosuke.png"/> Well… I guess I'll take him home…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We split up and headed home.</i><br/>

<b>Announcer:</b> The serial murder case in Inaba has claimed a third victim.<br/>
The news shocked local residents, who have not seen another murder in three months, and assumed the spree had reached its end.<br/>
The deceased taught at a local high school. Since his body was found arranged in a similar manner as the last two victims…<br/>
&gt; King Moron's picture is on the news.<br/>
&gt; It seems he really was murdered…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Nanako.png"/> What's wrong?<br/>
Was it someone you know?<br/>
…He died?<br/>
&gt; Nanako seems scared…<br/>
<br/>
<i>She wasn't taking this well.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-P4-00414.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You calmed Nanako down…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Nanako.png"/> I'm all right…<br/>
&gt; Nanako seems somewhat relieved.<br/>
<b>Announcer:</b> This marks the second consecutive death, after Ms. Saki Konishi's, where the target was involved with Yasogami High.<br/>
Mr. Morooka was known for his strict teaching methods, and is said to have had constant friction with his students.<br/>
The police will be pursuing this line of inquiry, and are planning to begin a large-scale investigation tomorrow.<br/>
We now turn to our reporter at the scene for more details…<br/>
&gt; The news is livelier than usual…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Nanako.png"/> Dad won't be coming home again today…<br/>
&gt; Maybe you should try another magic trick…<br/>
&gt; You move a finger on your right hand…<br/>
&gt; …to your left hand!<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was an old trick but I figured it was pretty good.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-P4-00428.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; This time, you move a finger on the left hand…<br/>
&gt; …to your right hand!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Nanako.png"/> It moved!<br/>
Hey, how did you do that? Tell me, tell me!<br/>
&gt; Nanako seems to have cheered up…<br/>
&gt; You put Nanako to bed and decided to call it a night as well…<br/>
<br/>
<i>God this day has been a mess. What else could happen?</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>Later that night…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-P4-00435.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Igor.png"/> Welcome.<br/>
It's been quite some time…<br/>
&gt; It seems you've been called to the Velvet Room…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Igor.png"/> Do not be alarmed. You are fast asleep in the real world…<br/>
I have summoned you within your dreams.<br/>
How are things proceeding…?<br/>
Are you gradually drawing nearer to a solution to the mystery…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Souji.png"/> Yes.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Igor.png"/> Excellent.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Margaret.png"/> The season has changed, but your future is not yet closed.<br/>
In time, a path will open to you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Igor.png"/> Our true reason for calling you here tonight is to provide a new form of assistance to help you achieve just that.<br/>
Fusing Personas… Have you been using our services diligently?<br/>
The aid we will henceforth provide is an advanced form of fusion…<br/>
I speak of the power to fuse four or more Personas at once.<br/>
I am quite certain that this will enable you to command even stronger powers…<br/>
&gt; A new type of fusion is now available!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Igor.png"/> Now… your journey will soon reach its climax…<br/>
And as a result, many challenges-which I cannot forsee at present-await you.<br/>
Most interesting… *chuckle *<br/>
Well, until we meet again… Farewell.
