<i>If there weren't two other people who would swear today happened just the way I'm writing now I'd assume I was totally fucked in the head. Normally when your day starts with a teacher in an Egyptian headdress that's the weirdest thing that happens in that day.</i><br/>

<b>Ms. Sofue:</b> First, a little about me. I love to use my dowser to look for lost items, and there's nothing quite like a romance.<br/>
In fact, world history is a magnificent romance. History is like a river; it was born in the past and flows ever forward.<br/>
I hope we can all enjoy the profundity of history together. Hohoho.<br/>
And since this is my first lecture, I'll start with an easy question.<br/>
Our transferee, Mr. Seta, please stand up.<br/>
When did A.D.-in other words, Anno Domini-begin?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Too easy.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Ms. Sofue:</b> Ah, you seem to understand this well. And does anyone know what B.C. stands for? Oh, I'll just tell you.<br/>
Before Christ, or the years before Christ was born.<br/>
This is, of course, the way we count our years today, but it wasn't adopted in Western Europe until the 15th century.<br/>
Hohoho, it was around that time that there were many religious wars and power shifts occurring.<br/>
Anyhow, the world's beliefs have been in an ever-flowing tide since humanity began to emphasize religion.<br/>
Most holidays are related to religion, you know. If you do some research, you may find some interesting facts.<br/>
But regardless of the culture or the tradition, the tide decides who will survive in the present and the future.<br/>
And those survivors ensure that their will is passed down to the next generation…<br/>
…But now it's time to start from the beginning. Let's take a look at the origin of civilization…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Everyone was still talking about the murder. Can't say I blame them. Yosuke was freaking too.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Sitting Girl:</b> Is it supposed to be like, mimicking an execution? It's messed up…<br/>
<b>Short Girl:</b> My senpai told me it was a third-year named Saki who found the body.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Y-Yo. Um…<br/>
It's, uh, it's not really that important, but…<br/>
Well, yesterday on TV, I…<br/>
Oh, uhh… Never mind. Look, I'll tell you later. Ahaha…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie was excited about the rumors going around.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Saki-senpai's supposedly the one who discovered that body.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> I wonder if that's why she looked so down… She doesn't seem to be at school today either.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Huh? Hey Yukiko, are you helping out at the inn today too?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yukiko.png"/> Things are really out of hand right now… I'm sorry.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I wasn't the only one who noticed she seemed really run down. And that wasn't the only thing to talk about…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> I guess they're running her ragged…<br/>
By the way, did you see… it… last night?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Huh…?<br/>
Uh, well… What about you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> I did! I seriously saw a girl!<br/>
But… my soulmate's a girl? What's that supposed to mean?<br/>
I couldn't quite tell who it was, but it was a girl for sure…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie described the exact person I'd seen…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Hey… I think that's the same person I saw.<br/>
I couldn't make out that much detail, though. The image I saw was much blurrier…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Wait, so you saw it too!?<br/>
And we saw the same girl…? Does that mean… we have the same soulmate?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> How should I know?<br/>
How 'bout you? Did you see it?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided to tell them about last night's little fiasco. I mean, if they'd seen the Midnight Channel maybe all the other stuff hit them too.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> It sounds like we all saw the same person…<br/>
But weird voices aside, what was that about getting sucked into your TV…?<br/>
Were you that tired last night? You must've just fallen asleep in front of your TV.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> That'd be one interesting dream, though.<br/>
I like the part where you got stuck 'cause your TV was too small. That's pretty realistic.<br/>
Well, if it had been bigger, the-<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie took a break from mocking me when she reminded herself of something. I'd say something but for the whole lightning reflexes and brutal accuracy thing.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Oh yeah? Well, flatscreen TVs are definitely in these days.<br/>
Wanna go check 'em out on the way back? We're beefing up our electronics department this month.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Oh, definitely! My parents don't know anything about electronics, and I've gotta see my kung-fu movies on the big screen!<br/>
Hwa-taaaa!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> We've got some pretty big ones in stock. I bet they'd be big enough for you to fit into, hehe.<br/>
&gt; They don't believe you at all…<br/>
&gt; You decided to go to Junes with the others.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was sure I was never going to live that story down.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> I dunno… Rich folks?<br/>
Honestly, not many people shop for TVs here. That's why we don't have clerks around.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Huh… Not worth trying then, I guess. Well, at least looking's free.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> …Nope, can't get in. Figures.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Haha, this proves it. It was all just a dream.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Besides, these flat-screen TVs are so thin, you'd just end up on the other side…<br/>
Argh, what am I saying!?<br/>
So, Chie. What kind of TVs are you guys in the market for?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> O-Oh, they said they wanted one that's cheap. You got any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
<i>They walked away to the smaller TVs nearby, while I kept just looking at this one. Something was bothering me about it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Wha-that's not cheap at all! There's way too many zeroes!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> I should've asked what you meant by "cheap" right off the bat.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> You've got connections, right? C'mon, hook me up!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> You know I can't do that…<br/>
Hey, how about this one over here? It's a display unit and it's a little old, but…<br/>
&gt; With a TV this big, you really might be able to go inside…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Just to prove to myself it was all a dream, I reached out to touch the screen.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00082.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>And went straight through it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00083.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke picked that moment to turn around and ask me about something.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00085.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Huh? Something wrong, Yosuke?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> I-Is his arm… in the TV…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Whoa…<br/>
Uhhh… Is that some kinda… new model? L-Like with a new function?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Hell no!<br/>
<br/>
<i>They ran over to see what was up. For my part, I wasn't sure whether I was happy or sad to be proven right.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00091.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Oh man… This is for real… That's some magic trick, man!<br/>
So how's it work, huh!? What's the magician's secret!?<br/>
&gt; Both of them are staring at you, astonished…<br/>
&gt; You might be able to put in more than just your arm…<br/>
<br/>
<i>This was one of those things that seemed like a good idea at the time.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00096.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Oh my God!<br/>
&gt; There's empty space inside…<br/>
&gt; You tell them that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Wh-What do you mean, "inside"!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Wh-What do you mean, "empty space"!?<br/>
&gt; It seems very spacious in here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Wh-What do you mean, "spacious"!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> I mean, what's going on!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Holy crap… I-I think this is all too much for my bladder…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh, Yosuke.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00106.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> I've been holding it in all day! I-I haven't had a chance to go…<br/>
Aaarrgh! Can't… hold it… anymore…!<br/>
Shit! Customers! They're coming!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> What!? But we've got a guy half stuck in a TV here!<br/>
Wh-What're we gonna do!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>And then they panicked, and we learned that as long as I'm stuck in the TV anyone can fall in. Who knew?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00113.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>It felt like we were going to fall forever.</i><br/>

<i>But eventually you always hit bottom.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00115.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>The damn place was a sea of fog.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00118.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Everything was sort of strange and staticky, too.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00122.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I was feeling okay, but I wanted to make sure the others were fine.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00123.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> I think my butt's cracked now…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Of course it is!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Whoa!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Wh-What now!? Did you wet your pants!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> No, stupid! Look around!<br/>
<br/>
<i>If we looked closely, we could see our surroundings through the fog.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00130.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Is this… a studio?<br/>
All this fog… Or is it smoke?<br/>
There's no place like this in Inaba, is there…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Hell no…<br/>
But man… this place is huge…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> What're we gonna do…?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00137.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> G-Good plan!<br/>
Look, we need to get home and--!<br/>
H-Huh…?<br/>
Wait a minute… Which way did we come in from?<br/>
I don't see a way in… or out!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> What? That can't be right! H-How could that be!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> I don't know! Don't ask me!<br/>
I can't take this anymore! I wanna go home!!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Okay… so how!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>What we needed was a damn way out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00147.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Y-Yeah, an exit! We need to find one!<br/>
Let's calm down and think about this.<br/>
All right, so we need to find a way out.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Is there really a way outta here…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> We got in… so we must be able to get out somehow.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> That's true, but…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> If there's no exist, we're trapped, so let's cross our fingers and look around.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke's sense of direction is infallible, by the way. You know, if you're wanting to become even more lost.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00155.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> It looks like we're in some kinda building, but… Damn, this fog's so thick, I can hardly see.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Are you sure we're not wandering further away?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> I can't be positive, but we've gotta trust our instinct a little.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> I know, but…<br/>
&gt; It seems that there's no choice for now but to continue onward…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We ended up in some creepy room. Looked sort of like a hotel room or something. You know, in hell.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00161.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> No service. What a surprise…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Can't you guys slow down a little? It's hard enough to see where you're going…<br/>
Huh? What the…!?<br/>
It's a dead end! There's no exit!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> It keep getting creepier and creepier the further we go…<br/>
Aargh! I can't hold it any longer…<br/>
My bladder's gonna explode…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Yosuke!? What're you doing!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I had to agree with Chie here.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00170.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> You're going here!? Oh, you have got to be kidding…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> T-Turn around! I can't go if everyone's watching!<br/>
Aaaaargh… I can't do it! It's all your fault if my bladder bursts!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Like I care…<br/>
Anyways… what's with this room?<br/>
Check out these posters… Their faces are all cut out…<br/>
Somebody must really hate this person…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And it just got worse and worse.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00178.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> It's tied in a noose… Is this a scarf?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> C'mon… Let's go back to where we came from, and look somewhere else for an exit…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Hey… I think I've seen that poster before…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Who CARES!? Let's go! I am sick of this place!<br/>
And I'm not feeling so good…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Now that you mention it, me too…<br/>
<br/>
<i>The fog in there is terrible.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00185.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Could it be due to this place's oppressive atmosphere…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Alright, let's go back. I'm seriously starting to feel sick…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And when we got back to the studio section, things managed to get even stranger.</i><br/>

Well, so do we! We just don't know how, dammit!<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> What's up now?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke noticed something chilling.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-P4-00241.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> She's been all over the news lately.<br/>
Something about… her husband having an affair with that announcer lady who died the other day.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, so does that mean…?<br/>
That weird room we saw… Could it be related to that Yamano lady's death…?<br/>
Now that I think about it… there was that creepy noose hanging from the ceiling…<br/>
Yaaargh, stop! No more! We gotta stop talking about this.<br/>
I'm gonna wipe what happened today from my brain. I don't think my poor heart can take anymore.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> I'm feeling a chill too…<br/>
Let's go home… I wanna lie down and rest.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We stuck together as long as we could. The chill we felt had nothing to do with the rain.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-P4-00252.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You still feel sluggish…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Dojima.png"/> Uh-Hmm… Well, I doubt you'd know…<br/>
But have you heard anything about a student named Saki Konishi?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I remembered Yosuke said he'd not seen her in school earlier.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-P4-00256.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Dojima.png"/> Oh. I see…<br/>
To be honest… we got a call from her family. She's disappeared.<br/>
We've got people looking for her, but she hasn't been found yet…<br/>
*sigh * Work just keeps piling up…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And then the news started. More on that damn murder case.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-P4-00261.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Announcer:</b> Not long ago, television announcer Mayumi Yamano was found dead in the small town.<br/>
Up until now, her whereabouts prior to her death had been unknown.<br/>
But the police investigation has found that she had been staying in the region's famous Amagi Inn.<br/>
&gt; The Amagi Inn… It's the inn that Yukiko's family runs…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Then things started to get kind of creepy in a new way honestly.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-P4-00266.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Commentator:</b> Oh yes, the Amagi Inn! Their hot springs are first-rate.<br/>
The manager's teenage daughter also works there, and it's rumored that she'll take over the inn this spring.<br/>
If that happens, she'll be one of the youngest managers on record! I should book another trip there!<br/>
<b>Announcer:</b> Uhh… I-I see… Moving along, it's time for the weather report.<br/>
The rain has begun to subside.<br/>
From now until morning, heavy fog warnings will be in effect in the Inaba region.<br/>
Visibility will be severely reduced, so please be careful if you plan on driving in the area…<br/>
&gt; The news continues.<br/>
&gt; Just before the announcer was found dead, she was apparently staying at the Amagi Inn, run by Yukiko's family…<br/>
And it seems the whereabouts of Saki Konishi, who discovered the body, are unknown…<br/>
<br/>
<i>What the hell is going on?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-P4-00277.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Dojima.png"/> Give it some more time.<br/>
&gt; You sneezed.<br/>
&gt; You feel a slight chill…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Dojima.png"/> Are you sick? You're probably still adjusting to the new environment.<br/>
Nanako, could you get him some cold medicine?<br/>
You should get to bed right after you take it.<br/>
<br/>
<i>So damn tired after going to that TV world… Anyway, all this will surely wait until the morning…</i><br/>
