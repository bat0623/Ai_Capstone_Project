			<b>9/6/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>Something I'd known was coming for quite some time happened this afternoon.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The door was open, so you cautiously went in.<br/>
<b>Doctor:</b> Now, try speaking to him…<br/>
<b>Yumi's Mother:</b> …Can you hear me?<br/>
Look… It's Yumi. She's come to see you today.<br/>
It's your daughter…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yumi.png"/> …Dad.<br/>
<b>Yumi's Father:</b> Yu…mi…<br/>
Yumi… Thank you…<br/>
You are… a kind girl… Like your mother…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yumi.png"/> I-I'm not kind… Not at all!<br/>
<b>Yumi's Mother:</b> You are a kind girl…<br/>
You're your parents' pride and joy.<br/>
You may be a bit angry and have a harsh tongue, but I know that's because you're trying to protect yourself…<br/>
<b>Yumi's Father:</b> It's my fault…<br/>
I'm sorry… I was so selfish… I caused you nothing but trouble…<br/>
But seeing you at last… Seeing you care for me…<br/>
I'm such a lucky man…<br/>
<br/>
<i>He really sounded awful.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Yumi's Father:</b> Yumi…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yumi.png"/> *sob * *sob * *sob *<br/>
<b>Yumi's Father:</b> Yumi, it took your mother and me many days to come up with your name.<br/>
Your name means "bear fruit," because we wanted you life to be full of good things…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yumi.png"/> What good things have I ever had in my life!?<br/>
<b>Yumi's Mother:</b> Only you know that…<br/>
Because you see, Yumi, the good fruit of our own lives… is you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yumi.png"/> Mom…<br/>
Dad…<br/>
*sob *<br/>
<b>Yumi's Mother:</b> No…<br/>
You must keep breathing…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yumi.png"/> Dad… Dad!<br/>
…You never gave me a chance to say it…<br/>
Dad… Thank you for bringing me… into this world…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided to go back outside and wait for her there.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yumi.png"/> *sniff * *sniff *<br/>
Dad… died.<br/>
I… I just don't know what's going on…<br/>
<br/>
<i>What the hell can I do but try and tell her it's all going to be alright?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yumi.png"/> Th-Thank… you… *sob *<br/>
&gt; Yumi is trying to come to terms with what happened.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yumi.png"/> Souji-kun… Please, stay here a little longer…<br/>
Stay… by my side.<br/>
&gt; You can feel that Yumi is relying on you to help her.<br/>
&gt; You feel that your relationship with Yumi has deepened…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nothing I can do at all sometimes…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yumi.png"/> Oh… I'm supposed to talk to the doctor…<br/>
I'm sorry. Goodbye…<br/>
…I'll see you at drama practice.<br/>
&gt; You said goodbye to Yumi and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I got to talking about things with Dojima when I got back home.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> I'm going to sleep…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> Hm? Oh, it's this late already? 'Night.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> What?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> You said you would read me a book before bed.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> Oh… Ohh, that's right…<br/>
I got it, I got it. Just a few pages.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> Yay!!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> Hold on.<br/>
Dojima here.<br/>
…Ichihara-san!<br/>
Yes… Yes… then that means…<br/>
Well, if it's okay with you, I can be there in just a few…<br/>
……<br/>
…I understand. Goodbye…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> Dad…? Are you leaving?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> It's… my job.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> But you said you'd read me a book…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> I can do that anytime…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't know where the hell Dojima's priorities are sometimes.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00077.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> ……<br/>
Of course not…<br/>
&gt; Dojima sighed quietly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> Are you two fighting…?<br/>
Y-You can go, Dad.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> No, that's not it… I'm sorry, Nanako.<br/>
What book do you want?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> …It's okay?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> I promised.<br/>
C'mon, let's go, Nanako.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> Yeah!<br/>
&gt; Nanako went to her room with Dojima…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was a while before Dojima came out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> ……<br/>
Let's talk.<br/>
The phone call was from Ichihara-san, my former senpai.<br/>
I'm having him run tests for Chisato's hit-and-run investigation.<br/>
He was calling to tell me that the test results are in…<br/>
…Judging by his tone, he didn't fine anything the police haven't already come up with.<br/>
I know going over there won't change the test results, but…<br/>
&gt; Dojima looks severely disheartened…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> It was a white sedan. Most likely large and American. As expected, no such car is registered in Inaba.<br/>
No records of one being repaired or scrapped, either… Worst case scenario, the car's out of the country by now.<br/>
It scares me…<br/>
That I couldn't catch the perp…<br/>
That I'll never have an outlet for this sick feeling… That I'll just have to swallow it…!<br/>
Every time I look at Nanako… Every time I notice ways she looks like her mother…<br/>
I feel like… my face is being pushed down into reality…<br/>
And it scares me…<br/>
Hah…<br/>
I never thought I'd be talking to you about this…<br/>
&gt; Dojima confided in you…<br/>
&gt; You feel that you understand Dojima more…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dojima hides this all so well, if he'd just talk about things more maybe it wouldn't all be so bad.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00111.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> I know I can't stay this way forever…<br/>
While you're still here… I need to face myself.<br/>
&gt; You sat with Dojima for some time in silence before going to your room.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>The trip starts tomorrow.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yosuke.png"/> Yo.<br/>
So are you ready for the trip yet? This guy won't shut up about it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kanji.png"/> Yosuke-senpai hasn't even started packing. He's all like, "Was that tomorrow?" 'Sup with that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yosuke.png"/> You are way too excited about this. I mean, you're even worried about how many boxes of animal crackers to bring.<br/>
We're only gonna be there for two nights, dude! Besides, I'm pretty sure they have convenience stores on Port Island.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kanji.png"/> For serious!? I've never really left this place, so…<br/>
Huh… I wonder if the murders here got as much play over there, too.<br/>
Like that Mitsuo Kubo dude. They're still showing him on TV here.<br/>
Every time I switch on the tube, the news is showing like, what he wrote in his yearbook. Pisses me off, man.<br/>
The frickin' media's slapping together anything they can find to make the dude look like a born criminal.<br/>
People think they can say anythin' they want about a guy who's been branded a criminal… 's just not right.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It has been pretty ridiculous.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00127.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kanji.png"/> I mean, I still hate the guy's guts.<br/>
But… I dunno, after getting involved with all this, I started to realize how off-base most rumors are…<br/>
It's so messed up…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yosuke.png"/> Well, I gotta admit, the news can be pretty out there.<br/>
Hey, it's Naoto.<br/>
Yo, how's it going?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Naoto.png"/> Good morn-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kanji.png"/> Oh yeah, I-I'm on duty today!<br/>
Heheheh! W-Well, see ya later!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yosuke.png"/> *sigh * He's the messed up one…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Ai asked if I wanted to go somewhere, so we made some plans.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00144.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Ai told you she would be right back…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Daisuke.png"/> What's up, Souji?<br/>
Our class had a guest speaker in the auditorium today, so…<br/>
<b>Other Student:</b> Oh yeah, you guys are both on the soccer team, huh?<br/>
<b>Conceited Student:</b> Hey… Isn't Ai Ebihara your manager!?<br/>
<b>Other Student:</b> Seriously!? Damn, now I'm jealous!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Daisuke.png"/> Ai Ebihara…? Oh, her. She's never around.<br/>
<b>Conceited Student:</b> Heh, probably because she's always on the prowl for guys.<br/>
<b>Smirking Student:</b> Yeah, I heard she's pretty loose. And doesn't she look like she's got a sugar daddy or two?<br/>
<b>Other Student:</b> Yeah, she's stacking the paper.<br/>
<b>Conceited Student:</b> I wonder how much she gets paid…?<br/>
<b>Other Student:</b> Damn, dude, don't hold back or anything!<br/>
<b>Smirking Student:</b> You think it's a cheaper market out here in the boonies?<br/>
<b>Other Student:</b> I don't know man, this is premium grade high school tail we're talking about… And with a body like that?<br/>
<b>Conceited Student:</b> Seriously, just look at her hips…<br/>
&gt; The conversation is getting more and more vulgar…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I wasn't going to let those assholes keep talking about her like that. Nobody deserves that kind of shit.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00161.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The conversation stopped abruptly.<br/>
&gt; It seems Daisuke was also offended…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Daisuke.png"/> Knock if off, guys. Maybe someone should spread some rumors about you, and we'll see how you like it.<br/>
<b>Other Student:</b> Alright, alright… Aw shit, I'm gonna be late for the meeting!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Daisuke.png"/> Sorry about that… Sounds like they've got the hots for our manager.<br/>
They were talking like that at practice too… But don't worry, I'll yell at them later, man.<br/>
&gt; You sense Daisuke's consideration…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Daisuke.png"/> I'll see you later.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Ai.png"/> ……<br/>
<br/>
<i>What is there to say at that point?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00173.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Ai.png"/> Are you just gonna pretend all that didn't happen…?<br/>
It's not like… that kinda stuff really bothers me.<br/>
I expect it.<br/>
They don't even know me. Why should I care what they think…?<br/>
I'm fine…<br/>
But… thanks.<br/>
&gt; Ai blushes happily…<br/>
&gt; You feel like you understand Ai even better now…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I get the feeling beneath the surface there's an Ai that's nothing like the way she acts.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00182.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Ai.png"/> I'm gonna head home…<br/>
……<br/>
And you're gonna walk with me.<br/>
&gt; You walked Ai to her house and went home…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Hmm. We're going to Port Island tomorrow. I wonder what it's like?</i><br/>
