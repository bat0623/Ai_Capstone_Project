<br/>
&gt; Maybe you should help him…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Oh yeah, that's right. You're that transfer student, Souji Seta.<br/>
I'm Yosuke Hanamura. Nice to meet ya.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Man took a serious tumble. And yet he keeps on ticking.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Oh yeah, yeah, I'm fine.<br/>
&gt; Yosuke seems to be all right…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Say, did you hear about the incident from yesterday? They found that announcer lady hanging from an antenna!<br/>
You think it was some kinda warning? There's no way something that weird could've been an accident.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Had a good point too.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Dangling a dead body over a roof like that… That's just messed up.<br/>
Then again, it's pretty messed up to kill someone in the first place.<br/>
Oh crap, we're late!<br/>
You wanna ride? It's a little squeaky, but it should be fine.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's a good thing we were running late and there was nobody to see us ride in, because that's a visual that could really stick with you. At least we got in before Morooka.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Morooka.png"/> You guys ARE in high school, aren't you!? Can't you shut up during class? Don't you have any common sense?<br/>
First of all, my job is to waste my precious time teaching you assholes philosophy! And since I'm so nice…<br/>
I'll straighten up your rotten attitudes while I'm at it! Aren't you honored!?<br/>
And I'll be going especially hard on any of you morons that're curious about the murder! Got it!? Now get your books out!<br/>
&gt; You listened to the lecture intently…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Anyway, after school Yosuke wanted to thank me for pulling him out of that can.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Souji.png"/> Yeah.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Wow, that was fast.<br/>
There isn't much to do here compared to the big city, but there is that certain… something you can't get anywhere else.<br/>
The air's clean, the food's great… Oh, you know about the local delicacy?<br/>
It's grilled steak, man! Like that's anything special, huh?<br/>
I know a place where you can get it cheap. Wanna come? You helped me out this morning, so it's on me.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't even know where Chie was, she materialized out of nowhere.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> My "Trial of the Dragon."<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Urgh… You always come around when I'm talking about food…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> How about it, Yukiko? Don't you think he should treat us, too?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Yukiko.png"/> I'll pass… I don't want to gain any more weight. I need to help out at the inn today, anyway.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Wow, Yukiko-san! You started training to take over the business?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Yukiko.png"/> It's not like that! I'm just helping out when it gets busy.<br/>
Well, I should be on my way.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> Oh well. We should get going too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Huh? Do I seriously have to treat two people…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke wasn't happy about having to treat Chie as well, but he wasn't going to risk another kick. Where he took us was kind of sketchy, though.</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>I mean Junes. Come on.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, well, once you hopped on the freeloader train, I had to change my plans.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> Still, that's no reason to take us to your place.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Dude, this isn't my place or anything.<br/>
Oh, right. I haven't told you yet, huh?<br/>
I moved here from another city about six months back.<br/>
This location just opened up, and my dad was assigned to manage it.<br/>
So our entire family came out here.<br/>
Here, this is to welcome you to town.<br/>
Satonaka, yours is on me too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> Yeah, I know.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We talked for a bit, and eventually the conversation moved to Junes.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> A lot of stores there started closing, and… Oh, uh…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> …You can't blame it all on Junes, can you?<br/>
……<br/>
Hey… It's Saki-senpai!<br/>
Sorry, be right back.<br/>
<br/>
<i>He was talking about some girl who'd just walked in.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> Oh, that's Saki Konishi. Her family runs a liquor store in the shopping district.<br/>
…I think she's working here part-time, though.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Saki.png"/> Heeey! I'm finally on break…<br/>
What's up, Hana-chan? Boosting the family business by bringing your friends here?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Madam, you wound me!<br/>
Kidding aside… You look down. Did something happen?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Saki.png"/> …It's nothing. I'm just a little tired.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, if you need to talk, I'm always willing to listen. I…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Saki.png"/> *chuckle * I'm okay. Thanks, though.<br/>
*sigh * Why'd I leave school early yesterday…?<br/>
Hey… is he the kid who transferred here?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Saki and Yosuke walked over.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Saki.png"/> It must be nice to have someone else from the big city to talk to, huh?<br/>
I don't see Hana-chan hanging out with the other guys much.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> N-Not necessarily…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Saki.png"/> He doesn't have too many friends, so I hope you two get along good.<br/>
Hana-chan's a good guy, but he can get nosy sometimes. You gotta tell him right to his face when he starts to annoy you.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Man's been kicked in the balls enough literally lately, I decided to go easy on him.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00081.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Saki.png"/> Ahaha, I know… I'm just kidding.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> C-C'mon, Senpai. There's no need to worry about something like that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Saki.png"/> Well, my break's just about over. Back to work I go…<br/>
Laters!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, uh, Senpai…!<br/>
Hahah, Saki-senpai says I'm annoying, but she's even nosier than me.<br/>
She has a younger brother, and she treats me pretty much the same way…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> Ohhh, you don't want her treating you like a brother, huh? Oh, I get it… So that's how it is…<br/>
The daughter of a local family-run liquor store and the scion of the invading chain… The flame of forbidden love!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Wha--!? Dude, it's not like that.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie had a crazy suggestion.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00092.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> You ever hear of the Midnight Channel?<br/>
You're supposed to look into a TV that's switched off, alone, exactly at midnight on a rainy night.<br/>
While you're staring at your own image, another person will appear on the screen…<br/>
And they say that person's your soulmate.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> What? For a second, I thought you were actually going to say something useful…<br/>
How can you get all excited over such a childish urban legend like that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> Childish, huh? You don't believe it, do you!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Of course I don't!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> Well, it's raining tonight! Let's all try it out-then you'll see!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Try it out…? Wait, you haven't even tried it out yourself!?<br/>
Wow, I'm trying to remember the last time I heard something this stupid…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke decided to change the subject from crazy rumors.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00104.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Ooh, what if the culprit behind it was still lurking around…? Heehee…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chie.png"/> Sheesh, you shouldn't joke about stuff like that. Now who's the childish one…?<br/>
All I am saying is, you guys better try it out tonight.<br/>
&gt; You heard the rumor about the Midnight Channel, where one can see one's soulmate on a rainy night.<br/>
&gt; Maybe you should try it out tonight…<br/>
<br/>
<i>The Midnight Channel, huh…? Anyway, Dojima still wasn't home when I got back.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Nanako.png"/> …Yeah.<br/>
Oh! He's home!<br/>

<i>And sure enough, he was.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Dojima.png"/> I'm back. Did anything happen while I was out?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Nanako.png"/> No. You're late again…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Dojima.png"/> I'm sorry… Been busy at work.<br/>
Can you put the news on for me?<br/>
<b>Announcer:</b> Next, more details in the developing story on the incident in foggy Inaba.<br/>
Announcer Mayumi Yamano's dead body was found hanging above a house in this isolated rural town.<br/>
It is confirmed that Ms. Yamano had been involved in an affair with Taro Namatame, husband of enka singer Misuzu Hiiragi.<br/>
&gt; It's a follow-up report about the incident yesterday…<br/>
&gt; When Ms. Yamano, the TV announcer, was alive, she was having an affair with a councilman's secretary…<br/>
&gt; The man's wife seems to be Misuzu Hiiragi, an enka singer…<br/>
&gt; Could the incident be tied to their lover's quarrel…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still, how would that politician dude have put her body up on an antenna? It makes no sense. Anyway, they had an interview with the person who found the body next. They seemed oddly familiar.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00127.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Announcer:</b> In addition, we now bring you an exclusive interview with the local student who found Ms. Yamano's body.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Dojima.png"/> *sigh * An interview with the kid…? Where the hell did they find her?<br/>
<b>Reporter:</b> What went through your mind when you saw it? Could you tell she was dead? Did you see her face?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-SakiBlur.png"/> U-Umm…<br/>
&gt; The female student's face and voice are indistinct.<br/>
&gt; But you feel like you've seen her before somewhere…<br/>
<b>Reporter:</b> Don't you think it's scary that someone was killed on a foggy day?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-SakiBlur.png"/> Huh…? She was killed?<br/>
<b>Reporter:</b> Oh, errr… So did you see anyone suspicious around here?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-SakiBlur.png"/> No, not really…<br/>
<b>Reporter:</b> We heard that you found it when you left school early. Did you have some personal business to take care of?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-SakiBlur.png"/> Huh? That's…<br/>
&gt; The reporter's enthusiasm seems to be perplexing the girl.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Wait, could it be…?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Announcer:</b> -A tragedy that occurred near the local shopping district.<br/>
Many storeowners are raising concerns about losing customers as a result…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Dojima.png"/> Hmph. If they lose more customers, it'll be because you're making such a stink about it…<br/>
<b>Commentator:</b> It really is a bizarre case, isn't it? I mean, hanging someone upside down from an antenna…<br/>
I'd have to say it's a warning or a sign from the culprit.<br/>
<b>Announcer:</b> Yes, but so far, no one has come forward to take credit for the crime.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Dojima.png"/> Loads of prank calls, though…<br/>
<b>Commentator:</b> So the cause of death is still unknown? And they don't have a single suspect yet?<br/>
Taxpayers' funds are going to a police force who can't even figure out if this is an accident or a homicide?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean how could it be an accident? Then again, how could it be anything? Things like this don't happen.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00151.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Announcer:</b> We'll be right back after these messages.<br/>
<b>Commercial:</b> At Junes, every day is Customer Appreciation Day. Come see for yourself, and get in touch with our products!<br/>
Every day's great at your Junes!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Nanako.png"/> Every day's great at your Junes!<br/>
Hey Dad… Can we go to Junes together sometime?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Dojima.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Nanako.png"/> …No?<br/>
&gt; He seems to be asleep…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Nanako.png"/> *sigh * Geez…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nanako said she could handle getting her father to bed, so I excused myself. I'm sure this Midnight Channel thing is nonsense, but I don't want to get kicked so I'd better humor Chie.</i><br/>
