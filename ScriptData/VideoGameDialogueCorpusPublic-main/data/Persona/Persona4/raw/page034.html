	<h3><strong>Part 34:</strong> 6/28/11-6/30/11</h3>
			<b>6/28/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>Kou decided to reveal his plan today. It… could have gone better. He stopped us before we got to practice and told us to come out to Okina.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Daisuke.png"/> So… What's all this about?<br/>
You made us skip out on practice, man. I think you owe us an explanation.<br/>
<b>Pretty Girl:</b> Oh, there he is. Kou-chan!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kou.png"/> Hey! Sorry for calling you here on such short notice.<br/>
<b>Pretty Girl:</b> That's okay. We weren't doing anything anyway.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Daisuke.png"/> What's going on…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kou.png"/> What does it look like? I set up a group blind date for us.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Daisuke.png"/> Huh!? Why didn't you tell me!?<br/>
&gt; You can hear the girls conversing with each other…<br/>
<b>Cute Girl:</b> They're from Yasogami High, huh? How'd they get here? By bus?<br/>
<b>Attractive Girl:</b> Yeah, that's way out in the boonies. I wonder how they plan to get home…<br/>
<b>Cute Girl:</b> Maybe they're hoping we'll invite them back to our place… Pervs! *giggle *<br/>
<b>Pretty Girl:</b> Well, I think they're passable as far as looks go, don't you?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Daisuke wasn't so interested, unfortunately. Would have been nice to spend some time with a person without anything mystical going on but no such luck it seems.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kou.png"/> Huh? No, wait!<br/>
S-Sorry ladies, looks like tonight isn't going to work out!<br/>
&gt; The three of you rode back home on the bus in awkward silence…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We caught up to Daisuke on the flood plain.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Daisuke.png"/> I never asked you to try and set me up with anyone.<br/>
I only went because you told me it was important…<br/>
Don't drag me into that BS. If you want to get a girlfriend, do it yourself.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kou.png"/> I did it for you!<br/>
You're always going on about how "girls are just a pain in the ass." But it's all an act!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Daisuke.png"/> Whaddya mean, "an act"!?<br/>
&gt; Their quarrel starts to escalate…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I had to get things calmed down before someone did something dumb.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kou.png"/> He's right… Sorry. Yelling won't solve anything.<br/>
&gt; Kou looks apologetic…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kou.png"/> You're just scared! You hear that!? Scared!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Daisuke.png"/> Scared…? Of what?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kou.png"/> Of girls!<br/>
You're scared of being rejected again, aren't you?<br/>
That's why you give them all the cold shoulder. You don't have to worry about it if they hate you already, right?<br/>
And it's no different with soccer! You're half-assing it!<br/>
You're scared to play seriously and hit your plateau!<br/>
You're afraid that if you play hard, you'll be depressed when you can't improve anymore!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Daisuke.png"/> Wha…? N-Now you're just making things up!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kou.png"/> You take all the fun out of life if you never have to feel pain. What's the point of living like that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Daisuke.png"/> I don't need you to lecture me about my life!<br/>
You got that!? It's MY life! You guys have nothing to do with it!<br/>
<br/>
<i>What an idiot.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kou.png"/> Of course we do!<br/>
What am I to you!? What is Souji to you!?<br/>
And what are you to Souji and me, huh!?<br/>
Don't talk like we have nothing to do with your life, dumbass!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Daisuke.png"/> I'm sorry…<br/>
Yeah…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We went down to the riverbank.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Daisuke.png"/> Girls are a pain in the ass, but I don't hate them… I'm just scared.<br/>
They come up and say they like me…<br/>
But then they tell me they can't understand me, they get disappointed, and break up with me.<br/>
Makes me wonder about myself…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kou.png"/> You're talking about that girl you dated in middle school, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Daisuke.png"/> Dated? Tch, I don't think you could even call it that.<br/>
I still remember… She said, "You're not the guy I thought you were. The real Daisuke is the one on the field."<br/>
When I think about going through all that again, I get scared… or maybe lonely. It's hard to tell.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kou.png"/> Forget about her…<br/>
There's always gonna be people like that. But you have to just let 'em go and move on.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Daisuke.png"/> ……<br/>
But… I can't let it go…<br/>
I still have feelings… What'll happen to them?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kou.png"/> Ahh… You really liked her, huh…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Daisuke.png"/> After she asked me out. But…<br/>
She was my first girlfriend.<br/>
I was thrilled… All I wanted to do was hold her close to me.<br/>
<br/>
<i>There's really only one thing for Daisuke to do.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Daisuke.png"/> …You're too nosy, you know that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kou.png"/> Yeah, what of it?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Daisuke.png"/> …Thanks.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kou.png"/> You can be pretty sincere when you want to, Daisuke.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Souji.png"/> That's his charm.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Daisuke.png"/> Knock it off!<br/>
&gt; Daisuke's face is red.<br/>
&gt; You felt your bond strengthen with Kou and Daisuke…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Now we just need to make sure Daisuke actually goes through with this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kou.png"/> Alright, Souji, it'll be your job to make sure Daisuke doesn't get cold feet about this thing.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Daisuke.png"/> I won't, dang it!<br/>
&gt; The three of you had a good time before heading home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Not much else going on, the weather's been pretty clear.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>6/29/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ai asked me out at lunch, I decided to take her up on that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ai.png"/> Today I feel like getting something that's easy to slip into.<br/>
Hmm, doesn't look like they've gotten anything new in. I already have all of this…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Souji.png"/> We'll have to come back.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ai.png"/> I'll get something next time, but I want something today, too. I came here to buy, not to look.<br/>
&gt; Ai looks enthusiastic…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ai.png"/> Hey, I'm thirsty.<br/>
But me an ice latte.<br/>
<br/>
<i>She's loaded, I think she can afford her own latte.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00098.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ai.png"/> Huh…? Did you seriously just say that?<br/>
You're probably the first guy who's ever taken that tone with me.<br/>
&gt; Ai is surprised…<br/>
<b>Saleswoman:</b> Oh, Ai-chan! You're back again?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ai.png"/> …Well, yeah?<br/>
<b>Saleswoman:</b> Are you looking for anything in particular today?<br/>
Oh, we got a purse in that's just your style! The guys'll be alllll over you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="https://lpix.org/S/30040/AI.PNG"/> …That's all right. I'm not shopping for purses today.<br/>
<b>Saleswoman:</b> Ooh, is that your boyfriend? He's quite a handsome one! Are you gonna introduce him to me?<br/>
I've had the worst luck with men lately! We were at the bar the other night-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ai.png"/> Sorry, we've really gotta get going. I'll be back.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Ai is certainly not the nicest person in the world.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00110.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ai.png"/> *sigh * I hate salespeople.<br/>
I'm the one keeping them in business, why do they have to pounce on me every time I go in there?<br/>
They should get rid of all salespeople and put in vending machines. Press a button, and out come your clothes.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'd definitely support machines where I put yen in and get weapons out so I'm down with that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00114.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ai.png"/> Isn't it? I don't need all that pointless banter.<br/>
I can see right through it… There's no such thing as a relationship without ulterior motives.<br/>
&gt; Ai looks somewhat sad…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ai.png"/> I don't know why, but I got a little annoyed when she was talking about you back there.<br/>
She said you were handsome. Good for you, I guess.<br/>
&gt; Ai looks like she was pouting…<br/>
&gt; You feel like you understand Ai a little bit more now…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't know, though, the way she lives does seem pretty sad.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00122.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ai.png"/> Let's go home. It'll be dark by the time we get back.<br/>
Not like I have any reason to hurry…<br/>
&gt; You returned to Inaba with Ai and went home…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I headed to the hospital again, and had a somewhat unsettling encounter there.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00134.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Is she… real…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Hisano.png"/> My…<br/>
……<br/>
Oh…<br/>
Forgive me…<br/>
&gt; It seems the old lady is looking in your direction…<br/>
&gt; The old lady left…<br/>
&gt; Who was she…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>And then of course things went from new and creepy to familiar and still pretty creepy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00143.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Sayoko found you and brought you here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Sayoko.png"/> Well done.<br/>
You could just slack off and do a half-assed job, but you really do work your cute little butt off, don't you?<br/>
…So why are you working at a job like this?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Souji.png"/> For the money.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Sayoko.png"/> Hmmmm. You're a starving student?<br/>
Then should you really be caught up here with a "naughty" lady like me?<br/>
&gt; Sayoko smiles mischievously…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Sayoko.png"/> But still, a young child shouldn't be wasting time wiping windows at the hospital…<br/>
I'm sure there are girls who would cry if they saw you doing menial chores like this.<br/>
Speaking of which… Say, do you have a girlfriend?<br/>
<br/>
<i>This was technically not the truth, though it helped serve a greater truth that as far as she's concerned I'm not available.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00156.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Sayoko.png"/> Oho… Then you can't let your girlfriend see you like this, hmm?<br/>
&gt; Sayoko smiles mischievously…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Sayoko.png"/> …High schoolers are so young.<br/>
They're only ten years younger, but they seem so far away…<br/>
It's like they're glittering. I feel this… What do you call it? Envy?<br/>
Maybe that's why…<br/>
……<br/>
…I just want to see them get screwed over by life.<br/>
Oho, that was a joke, of course.<br/>
Half of it was, anyway…<br/>
…Do you see what I'm getting at?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't know that she's actually serious about all of this though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00168.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Sayoko.png"/> Oho… I keep telling you, silly, that that's the kind of reaction I just find… irresistible…!<br/>
&gt; Sayoko smirks at you…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Sayoko.png"/> I have to go now. I have a lot of work piling up.<br/>
But I just can't help myself…<br/>
It's because you're just so cute…<br/>
&gt; Sayoko smiles in satisfaction…<br/>
&gt; You can feel Sayoko's mischievous affection for you…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean she could just be messing me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00176.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Sayoko.png"/> Sorry to bother you while you're on the job. Keep up the good work, okay?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I guess I get huge supernatural power out of this but it's still pretty strange.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>6/30/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>These days have just flown by, it'll be exams and break in like a month.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00188.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Yamada:</b> But I've gotta say, if you keep trying, something good will come of it someday. …Wow, I said something inspirational.<br/>
Just try not to take things too seriously. That'll only tire you out faster, right?<br/>
So let's take a quick break. I have an interesting question for you.<br/>
Let's see… Hmm… Souji-kun!<br/>
Which one of these is the name of a real river?<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's lucky I caught the episode of 'Worlds Dumbest Place Names' that had this in it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00195.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Yamada:</b> Correct! Sounds like you're officially an ex-city boy now! Haha, not that it matters.<br/>
Anyway, that river is in Nicaragua, and "Pis Pis" is pronounced "pie pie." It shares the name with a water weed there.<br/>
Lots more places have silly names. There's "No Name Canyon" in Colorado, or the city of Uncertain, Texas in America.<br/>
…Ooops, I wasted a lot of time on this. I hope I have enough time to cover everything that'll be on the test…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke offered me a meal to pay me back for last time, and as my free stuff policy remains ever intact I accepted.</i><br/>
<br/>
 <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00203.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You came here with Yosuke for a quick bite to eat…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Yosuke.png"/> So whatcha gonna eat today?<br/>
<b>Gaudy Student:</b> Hey, Hanamura!!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Yosuke.png"/> …What is it today?<br/>
<b>Gaudy Student:</b> How come Kazumi can take the day off and we can't?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Yosuke.png"/> …Huh?<br/>
<b>Snooty Student:</b> We told you before! We can't work weekends!<br/>
So when we refused, they said they were going to fire us! I don't get this!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, I talked to the manager…<br/>
Senpai… Have you been taking absences without leave lately?<br/>
<b>Gaudy Student:</b> I-I just forgot to come…<br/>
Besides, that's not the point! What're you going to do about this!? I have a date that day!<br/>
<b>Snooty Student:</b> How come you're favoring Kazumi, huh!?<br/>
You were like that with Saki, too!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Yosuke.png"/> …Huh?<br/>
<b>Gaudy Student:</b> Don't try to hide it! We all know!<br/>
You liked Saki and treated her special!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I could already tell this was about to get uncomfortable.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00221.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Yosuke.png"/> I don't think Saki-senpai has anything to do with this subject.<br/>
<b>Gaudy Student:</b> Yeah, it does!!<br/>
You told the other workers to take it easy on Saki too, didn't you?<br/>
You think you can do anything just because you're the manager's son!?<br/>
<b>Snooty Student:</b> So it's Kazumi now that Saki's dead!? Don't even bother, she has a boyfriend.<br/>
Didn't you get it!? Saki didn't like you!<br/>
We heard so from her! She may have acted that way, but…<br/>
&gt; They started to badmouth Saki-senpai…<br/>
<br/>
<i>People shouldn't be speaking ill of the dead.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00230.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Yosuke.png"/> Souji…<br/>
<b>Snooty Student:</b> Who are you? Are you stupid!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Yosuke.png"/> Don't talk like that to Souji!<br/>
Just shut up, will you!? You're really getting on my nerves!<br/>
What do you know about Saki-senpai!?<br/>
She didn't do things half-assed like you!<br/>
She looked lazy, but she worked hard! She talked bad, but she was good inside!<br/>
So she hated me? I knew that!<br/>
She's not here anymore! I'm left behind!<br/>
…Just leave me alone.<br/>
<b>Gaudy Student:</b> Wh-What the heck…?<br/>
<b>Snooty Student:</b> …Let's go.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Yosuke.png"/> ……<br/>
I just blurted out a buncha crap, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean he just told it to them like it was really.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00245.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Yosuke.png"/> N-No, I was just…<br/>
……<br/>
&gt; Yosuke is smiling pathetically…<br/>
Damn… Another pathetic display from Yosuke, huh?<br/>
……<br/>
Thanks, though.<br/>
Hearing you say that stuff to them… It made me happy.<br/>
&gt; Yosuke is smiling sheepishly…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Yosuke has grown deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke told me after that freakout he thinks he can help knock some sense into people having problems in battle. I guess that will remain to be seen.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00255.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Yosuke.png"/> *sigh * I don't want to… I really don't want to, but I'll go talk with Dad…<br/>
At this rate, those two are gonna quit… I should tell him and apologize…<br/>
I don't know… What do I want to do?<br/>
I don't get it… even though it's my own future.<br/>
…Sorry, but I'll see you later, Souji.<br/>
&gt; You saw Yosuke off and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>There's not going to be any sustained rain for a while it looks like, which is nice. Even though we've saved Rise, it's always unnerving when that fog descends on Inaba.</i>
