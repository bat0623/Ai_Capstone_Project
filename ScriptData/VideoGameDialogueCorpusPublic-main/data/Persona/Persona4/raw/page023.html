			<b>5/24/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>Kanji's still in pretty bad shape despite his brave show yesterday, I can't imagine what being in that TV world for so long has to be like. We're in sort of a holding pattern for now. Oh, and I found that dog.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It looks like the dog you saw on the riverbed…<br/>
&gt; It must be the runaway dog referred to on the ema the fox showed you.<br/>
&gt; It seems the dog is wary of you. What should you do?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I didn't want to scare it off.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Missing Dog:</b> *whimper *<br/>
&gt; It seems the dog became less wary of you.<br/>
&gt; The dog ran away…<br/>
&gt; You're doubtful it'll return here any time soon. You should look for it another day…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I ran into Yukiko on the way back into school. She wanted to head down to the book store, so I went there with her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It seems Yukiko has bought a book about job certifications…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> …Thank goodness. That was the last one.<br/>
Sensei recommended this book to me because it has details on a bunch of different job licenses…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Seems Yukiko might be serious about wanting to get out of here.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Uh-huh… That's right.<br/>
&gt; Yukiko seems a bit embarrassed…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Inside the TV… The "other me" said she didn't want to inherit the inn…<br/>
I think… those were my true feelings.<br/>
So I've decided to be a little more true to myself…<br/>
I… I refuse to inherit the Amagi Inn!<br/>
When I graduate… I'm leaving this town!<br/>
…I said it.<br/>
……<br/>
I said it!<br/>
Haha…<br/>
&gt; Yukiko has a refreshing smile on her face…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> So in order to live on my own, I'm thinking of getting a job license.<br/>
I was thinking something along the lines of an interior decorator… What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
<i>She does seem to have thought this through a bit.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> it's cool, isn't it…?<br/>
&gt; Yukiko looks happy…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> But it's hard. It costs money to get a license…<br/>
And of course I can't tell Mother…<br/>
If only there was a part-time job I could do discreetly…<br/>
&gt; You can make envelopes in your room…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Really…!? I'll go check the board, then!<br/>
&gt; It seems you were able to help Yukiko…<br/>
&gt; Touched by Yukiko's spirit, you feel your relationship has grown deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still, just getting this out seems to be making her happy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Thank you for keeping me company today.<br/>
I was a bit nervous when I told you how I felt, but…<br/>
…Now that I did, I feel much better.<br/>
&gt; You parted with Yukiko as she headed toward the bulletin board and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh, and Dojima was finally back, and wanted to talk to me about a little something.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Dojima.png"/> They say you did well on that last exam.<br/>
I heard about it when I was investigating.<br/>
It's great to see you're taking care of your responsibilities, even though you just moved here.<br/>
I need to act like an uncle every so often and give you some spending money.<br/>
But don't spend it all in… Nah, you can use it however you like.<br/>
&gt; You obtained 20000 yen from Dojima.<br/>
<br/>
<i>They'd gotten some stuff I could make lunch with again, so I hit up the kitchen.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You have the ingredients to make sweet and sour pork.<br/>
&gt; You decided to make sweet and sour pork.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; It's almost finished…<br/>
&gt; How should you make the sauce thicker?<br/>
<br/>
<i>This was obvious.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You mixed the starch with water and poured it into the pan.<br/>
&gt; Obtained Crispy Sweet and Sour Pork.<br/>
&gt; …In addition, you made Bait x3 from the leftovers.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Wonder how long we'll have to wait?</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>5/25/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Still no word from Kanji.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00091.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Chatty Girl:</b> I saw a new job posting on the town bulletin board!<br/>
The daily pay for being a tutor looks really good.<br/>
<b>Braided Girl:</b> Yeah, but… Don't you need to have more Knowledge before anyone would ask YOU to tutor them?<br/>
<b>Chatty Girl:</b> Wh-Why would you say that!?<br/>
Anyway, you're wrong!<br/>
It turns out you need Understanding to take the tutoring job!<br/>
<b>Braided Girl:</b> Yeah, but you don't have much of that, either.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I had way too much of that pork so I grabbed Daisuke and Kou to help me polish it off.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You ate lunch with Daisuke and Kou.<br/>
&gt; You ate Crispy Sweet and Sour Pork together.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Daisuke.png"/> This is delicious. I didn't know you could cook.<br/>
Got enough for seconds? My stomach's a bottomless pit!<br/>
<br/>
<i>After school I checked out the bulletin board. There were a few new job postings but I wasn't able to take them quite at the moment. I found the dog again near the river.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00106.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It seems that the dog is still wary of you. What should you do?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I tried to calm it down by singing to it, with mixed success.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00109.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The dog became quiet, but it still seems uneasy around you.<br/>
&gt; The dog ran away…<br/>
&gt; You should look for it on another day…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukiko wanted my opinion on something, so I headed out with her to Junes.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00113.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Yukiko brought you here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Why are there so many different types of food…?<br/>
Even eggs come in so many varieties…<br/>
<br/>
<i>She was getting a lot of food, so I thought this was a fair question.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00117.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> No! I'd never dream of it!<br/>
I don't think my food's nearly good enough to serve to the guests.<br/>
&gt; Despite saying so, Yukiko looks happy…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> I was just thinking of practicing my cooking…<br/>
Since I've decided to leave town… Eating out all the time is bad for you, right?<br/>
So I'm going to get some practice while I can!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Makes sense.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00124.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Thank you!<br/>
&gt; Yukiko nodded happily…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Oh, yes.<br/>
I was thinking that maybe you could taste-test my food sometime…<br/>
I want someone to eat it and let me know how it is. I thought I'd improve quicker that way…<br/>
And knowing you, I'd get an honest opinion…<br/>
W-Will you…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm going to regret this, aren't I?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00132.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Really!? Thank you!<br/>
&gt; Yukiko smiles happily…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> When I obtained the power of Persona, I thought, "I can do it…"<br/>
I used to think I couldn't do anything on my own, but maybe I really can…<br/>
I depended on others up until now, but from this point on, I want others to depend on me…<br/>
I'll do my best!<br/>
&gt; You can sense Yukiko's iron will…<br/>
&gt; You feel your bond with Yukiko has grown yet stronger…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh, and Yukiko saw one of the waitresses at the Inn do something really unspeakable to some guy with a fan recently. She managed to get the secret of it and I understand it's devastating.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Now then, um…<br/>
Where do they sell lobsters?<br/>
&gt; You helped Yukiko with her shopping and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was able to talk her out of the lobsters fortunately. Still, it's good that she's trying.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>5/26/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Some things never change, like Yosuke.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00149.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Ms. Sofue:</b> As I discussed last time, civilizations coexisted with rivers… But Egypt was a special case.<br/>
In order to predict when the Nile would flood, they created a calendar. Egypt introduced math to measure the land.<br/>
Wisdom was born so people could live together with nature. Ah, there's so much romance in ancient history…<br/>
Some fools find romance in war… But what culture can truly be born from conflict?<br/>
My older brother was like that. A dense samurai with no respect for the ancient civilizations…<br/>
He's always wearing a rugged Japanese kabuto. How disgraceful. My Nemes headdress is so much more elegant!<br/>
…Hm? You! You didn't think I'd catch you spacing out, Mr. Hanamura!?<br/>
Tell me, what kind of writing system did the Egyptians use back then!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> Hmm!?<br/>
U-Uh, writing system? Y-You wanna know what kind it was…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's good for Yosuke that I'm around.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00160.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Ms. Sofue:</b> Oh, so you've been doing your reading. I'm impressed, Mr. Hanamura.<br/>
You're right. Egyptians used sacred carvings, also known as Hieroglyphics.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Yosuke.png"/> Thanks, Souji! I guess I should open the book for this class sometime…<br/>
<br/>
<i>That dog was back by the river.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00165.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It seems that the dog is still wary of you. What should you do?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I tried talking to it again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00167.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Missing Dog:</b> *whimper *<br/>
&gt; It seems the dog became less wary of you.<br/>
<b>Missing Dog:</b> *whimper *<br/>
&gt; The dog isn't trying to run away. It seems to like you.<br/>
&gt; …But it seems to be out of energy.<br/>
&gt; Perhaps it's hungry.<br/>
&gt; If you gave it something a dog would eat, it may become energetic again…<br/>
&gt; But you don't have anything like that.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I headed down to Souzai Daigaku in the shopping district and got some steak, but the dog was already gone when I got back. I'll have to get him tomorrow. Oh, and we had a soccer game today.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00184.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Soccer Player:</b> Alright, we've got a game today, so don't hold back!<br/>
&gt; The soccer game began.<br/>
&gt; It's time to show the results of your hard practice!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I've gotten damn good again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00188.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Soccer Player:</b> What was that!?<br/>
Nice! Get the ball to Souji if he's open!<br/>
That was crazy, Souji! I didn't know you could hustle like that!<br/>
With him on the team, we might have a shot at next year's tournament.<br/>
Man, I'm glad you came along.<br/>
&gt; Thanks to your play, it seems the rest of the team has begun to acknowledge you.<br/>
&gt; You owe it all to your training…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed to Aiya after the game.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00196.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; After waiting for basketball practice to end, you came here with Daisuke and Kou…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Kou.png"/> That's awesome! So the training paid off, huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Daisuke.png"/> You should've seen the looks on their faces.<br/>
Now he won't get stuck with all the grunt work. He's one of the team!<br/>
&gt; Daisuke is beaming as if it's all thanks to him…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Kou.png"/> Nice. So am I free now?<br/>
It's hard work polishing balls after a full day of b-ball practice.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Daisuke.png"/> Yeah, thanks for helping out, Kou.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Kou.png"/> It's not like I did it for you!<br/>
Still, Souji, I'm glad it all worked out!<br/>
&gt; Kou is beaming like it's all thanks to him…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was pretty happy they'd helped me out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00208.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Daisuke.png"/> No worries. In the end, it was all you, man.<br/>
&gt; Daisuke nods.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Kou.png"/> Well, I say we celebrate!<br/>
One extra order of mapo rice, please! Souji, yours is on me.<br/>
&gt; The three of you celebrated the end of your training…<br/>
You feel your relationship has grown even stronger…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Things are going pretty well honestly.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00215.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Daisuke.png"/> I'll have the pepper steak. Hold the green beans.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Kou.png"/> …Hold the beans? All you've got left is mean, dude.<br/>
If that's all you want, why don't you order this?<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; The three of you had a good time talking about food…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still, can't let myself forget that we're on the lookout for a killer…</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>5/27/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Interesting day today.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00223.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The dog isn't trying to run away. It seems to like you.<br/>
&gt; …But it seems to be out of energy.<br/>
&gt; Perhaps it's hungry.<br/>
&gt; If you have it something a dog would eat, it may become energetic again…<br/>
&gt; You gave it a Steak Skewer.<br/>
<b>Missing Dog:</b> *woof * *woof *<br/>
&gt; The dog looks happy.<br/>
&gt; The dog ran away energetically. It should be able to return to its owner's house now.<br/>
&gt; You accomplished the request written on the ema!<br/>
&gt; You should report back to the fox…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I had some free time and needed the cash, so I headed to work at the day-care center again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00239.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Yuuta:</b> I don't wanna play house!<br/>
Let's play hide-and-seek! You're it!<br/>
&gt; Yuuta is full of energy.<br/>
&gt; Once again, the children tug at you from all directions.<br/>
<b>Day Care Supervisor:</b> Souji-kun!<br/>
Most of the children have been picked up, so you can go home now.<br/>
I'll see you next time!<br/>
&gt; You finished your job and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>On the way home, I saw a familiar face.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-P4-00250.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You see Yuuta's mother sitting over there.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided to go over and talk to her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-P4-00252.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Eri.png"/> Oh! It's already this late?<br/>
I've been sitting here all this time…<br/>
<br/>
<i>She looked like she was thinking something over.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-P4-00255.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Eri.png"/> …Oh, no, it's nothing.<br/>
*chuckle * You're a high school student, right? You seem so mature…<br/>
I was heading over there… I was going to pick up Yuuta…<br/>
But then something came over me… My legs just went weak all of a sudden.<br/>
Every time I think about him…<br/>
&gt; Yuuta's mother sighs…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Eri.png"/> …Have you heard?<br/>
Yuuta and I aren't related by blood…<br/>
He's my husband's child. I've lived with Yuuta for six months now…<br/>
Only six months… Already six months… We don't ever talk to each other.<br/>
My husband is away, so… Heh… It's just the two of us, alone together in a dark house.<br/>
<br/>
<i>That's a pretty terrible situation really.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-P4-00267.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Eri.png"/> Oh… I'm sorry. I didn't mean to tell you all this out of the blue…<br/>
…But I'm glad that you listened to me, that you spoke with me…<br/>
Haha, it's sad, but these days, I don't even get to have simple conversations like this…<br/>
&gt; Yuuta's mother is smiling weakly…<br/>
&gt; It seems she is trying her best to adapt to living in the countryside…<br/>
&gt; You feel a faint bond forming between you and Yuuta's mother…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's interesting that the universe rewards me for horribly intruding on others' lives.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-P4-00275.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Eri.png"/> I'm Eri Minami.<br/>
Nice to meet you. Please take good care of him.<br/>
…Oh, that's right. I still need to pick him up.<br/>
It was nice meeting you…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Well, I might have moved to a small town just in time to have to fight horrible monsters and search for a murderer but she might actually have it worse.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>5/28/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Not much happened today, went to soccer practice. Still waiting on Kanji.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>5/29/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Kou called earlier today.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-P4-00295.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Kou.png"/> If you're bored, wanna do something with me and Daisuke today?<br/>
Sound good?<br/>
Alright! Don't forget, okay?<br/>
<br/>
<i>We stopped by the bookstore.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-P4-00301.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Kou.png"/> So what'd you buy, Daisuke?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Daisuke.png"/> A comic. I was feeling kinda nostalgic when I saw it 'cause I used to have it…<br/>
Wait… this isn't what I…<br/>
…I got the wrong one.<br/>
Instead of Rubber-Armed Pitcher Hero, I bought Lovely Witch Detective…<br/>
……<br/>
Here, Souji, you can have it.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Did I mention I literally will take anything free no matter what?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-P4-00309.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Kou.png"/> I didn't know you read those kinda books…<br/>
You must be one of those comic snobs.<br/>
&gt; Obtained Witch Detective.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Daisuke.png"/> What can I say…? The covers looked exactly alike…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie walked by while we were there. I think Kou's kinda into her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-P4-00314.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Chie.png"/> You three, all together?<br/>
Now that's a weird trio… Then again, you guys are all into sports, huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Kou.png"/> Ch-Chie-san.<br/>
Uh… What are you doing?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Chie.png"/> …Training!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Kou.png"/> Training…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Daisuke.png"/> You're the man, Chie.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Chie.png"/> Hell no!<br/>
&gt; It promises to be an entertaining day.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I wonder how long we'll have to wait on this? The killer could already be scoping out his next victim, we don't have time to mess around.</i>
