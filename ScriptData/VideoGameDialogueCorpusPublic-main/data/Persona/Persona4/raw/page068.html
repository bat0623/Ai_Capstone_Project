			<b>10/4/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>Ugh, today. At least it wasn't raining in the morning, there is that.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Mr. Kondo:</b> Remember, though, you should always drink water afterwards! If you can, drink 2.5 liters of water everyday!<br/>
Why 2.5 liters, you ask? Well, I'll tell you! That's how much water you lose on a daily average.<br/>
…Hmm, I choose you, Souji!<br/>
How much of those 2.5 liters of water do you think you lose by sweating? On average, of course.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's not really that much percent wise.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Kondo:</b> Wow, how'd you know that!? I'm impressed, Souji!<br/>
About 1.5 liters of water leave your body through waste, about .5 liters leave through breathing, and .5 from sweat!<br/>
So you lose water from just being alive! See why it's so important to drink it!?<br/>
I especially recommend that you drink water after exercise! Well, that's it for today! You're… DISMISSED!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Then it started raining. It's supposed to continue through the night and on to tomorrow, which means the fog is coming soon.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>10/5/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ughh, not only is it raining, not only is the fog coming, but now this.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Mr. Yamada:</b> Must mean it's really autumn now. Yes, the season of classic love.<br/>
Imagine a couple, walking down a road lined with trees… Their hands join, their lips come closer… I better stop!<br/>
A-Ahem, speaking of trees… Ginkgo trees are stinky. Do you guys know how horrible it is to clean up around them?<br/>
Oh yeah… Anyone have any idea why a ginkgo tree's leaves turn from green to yellow?<br/>
Umm… I feel bad picking on Yukiko-san, so… Yosuke!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Why doesn't he feel bad about picking on me…?<br/>
Umm… Any ideas, Souji?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Pretend I said something profound about chlorophyll here.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Yamada:</b> Wow, good job. I had faith that you'd get it right, Yosuke!<br/>
The green coloration is caused by chlorophyll, and as it ages, the leaf's true color emerges: yellow.<br/>
People think the leaves turn from green to yellow, but what you're actually seeing are their original colors.<br/>
Though, the color change in maple leaves is a very different process. But that's more of Ms. Kashiwagi's field! Haha!<br/>
Ahhh… So the original color makes autumn more beautiful. That's pretty crazy…<br/>
Well, thanks, Souji.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I went to Aiya for my customary celebratory Aiya bowl. It tasted like victory.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Weather Announcer:</b> The week ended on a wet note as rain clouds moved into the area.<br/>
As a result, a thick fog is expected to form in the Inaba region later tonight…<br/>
&gt; It seems the fog will set in tonight…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And of course it did.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The fog has set in…<br/>
&gt; No one is appearing on the Midnight Channel.<br/>
&gt; Since Naoto has been rescued, it seems the killer was thwarted this time…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still, we're no closer right now. Hopefully Naoto has something for us when she gets back.</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>Meanwhile…</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>Naoto was feeling better today, it's good to see her back.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Naoto.png"/> Yes, thanks to all of you.<br/>
I'd like to thank you once again for what happened.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Don't mention it. But hey, your uniform…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Naoto.png"/> Huh? Ah… yes.<br/>
After contemplating the matter, I went with what I've been wearing thus far. There's no need for you to…<br/>
<b>Rumor-Loving Student:</b> Hey, it's the Detective Prince.<br/>
<b>Knowledgeable Student:</b> That's no Prince. I heard "he's" a she!<br/>
<b>Rumor-Loving Student:</b> Huh!? Y-You serious!? If he's a she, then uh… O-Oh crap!<br/>
<b>Short-Haired Girl:</b> Aww… I'm kinda disappointed, but then again, there's something neat about it…<br/>
<b>Brown-Haired Girl:</b> Yeah… If you look at it a certain way, doesn't she seem pretty cool?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Naoto.png"/> My, my… Rumors spread so quickly.<br/>
<br/>
<i>The rumors don't matter, though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Naoto.png"/> Th-Thank you…<br/>
But it doesn't bother me at all. There's no need to worry on my behalf.<br/>
So please treat me as you did before.<br/>
That aside, I'd like to discuss the case with you all.<br/>
We're dealing with a kidnap-and-murder case perpetrated by someone lurking in this very town.<br/>
And it isn't over yet…<br/>
Let's go over the finer points after school.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We all headed to Junes. Naoto had some details none of the others had managed to pick up.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Naoto.png"/> But when I opened the front door, I saw no one there…<br/>
Just as alarm bells sounded in my mind, someone grabbed me roughly from behind and covered my mouth with something.<br/>
Immediately afterward, I was put into something like a sack and most likely carried on the culprit's shoulder.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Rise.png"/> Wow, how could you remember all that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Naoto.png"/> The culprit seems to have used a chemical to incapacitate me, but luckily I wasn't completely unconscious.<br/>
I had been expecting a trick along those lines, so I was somewhat prepared.<br/>
And of course, I was desperate to gather as much information as I could.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Teddie.png"/> No wonder you're an ace detective.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kanji.png"/> That ain't something to be proud of. You are too damn calm about all this…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Naoto.png"/> Judging by their actions and body type, I'd say the culprit is definitely a man.<br/>
I heard no conversations or voices, so I believe he is acting alone.<br/>
It's after that that things get murky…<br/>
I felt a single impact, which I assume is when I was thrown inside the TV…<br/>
But the time from kidnapping to that point seemed too short… It was a matter of minutes.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm never sure where Chie gets these ideas but they can't all be gold.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00086.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> Oh! Could there have been a TV on the side of the road!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Naoto.png"/> Regrettably, my memory from there on is a blur…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> I see…<br/>
But man… The killer came right up to the door and rang the bell? That's just crazy.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Naoto.png"/> I finally understand why you all testified that you couldn't recall much of what happened.<br/>
Such a bizarre experience, with mental and physical fatigue on top of it… It's only natural to be confused.<br/>
And going by the surrounding circumstances, my kidnapping and everyone else's were near identical…<br/>
There is no question that the culprit is the same in each case.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> So… that Mitsuo boy, who said he killed King Moron…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Naoto.png"/> Everything makes sense now.<br/>
I can't say for sure until I gather more concrete evidence…<br/>
But Mitsuo Kubo's only victim was Mr. Morooka. It was a copycat killing that mimicked the culprit's method.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> No wonder King Moron's death broke the pattern in so many ways…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Naoto.png"/> The question remains, though, as to how Kubo learned of that world.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> That's it! That's what was bothering me!<br/>
<br/>
<i>This one was a bit better actually.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00102.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Naoto.png"/> I believe he didn't understand the other world as well as the true culprit.<br/>
Even though I can now enter it myself, it wouldn't occur to me to use it for murder…<br/>
And remember, the previous corpses left no sign that their deaths had anything to do with the other world.<br/>
After Kubo became wanted, leaving him with nowhere to run, he probably thought for the first time…<br/>
"What if I put my entire body into the TV?"<br/>
The bizarre condition of the corpses that caused such commotion is probably because they died on the other side…<br/>
It's a simpler explanation than figuring out why the killer would risk disposing of the bodies in such a way.<br/>
Which means their inexplicable condition of being hung on a foggy day wasn't due to the culprit making a statement…<br/>
Much of our speculation could be tested if we could ask Kubo in person. However…<br/>
I've unfortunately been taken off the investigation.<br/>
And I highly doubt that the police will believe any of this…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Rise.png"/> They wouldn't admit that it wasn't Mitsuo in the first place…<br/>
Once you've said something on TV, it's not easy to admit you were wrong.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Naoto.png"/> I believe the primary cause of my dismissal was because I raised that possibility to them.<br/>
The police won't readily concede that they made false charges… All the more so if the accused is a juvenile.<br/>
In fact, the overwhelming sentiment within the police force is to end this case with his arrest.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It looks like we're on our own, as always. And Yosuke's still a dick, also as always.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00119.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kanji.png"/> Those dickheads… I had a feeling that would be the case. Not that I trusted 'em in the first place.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> But uh, Naoto… If you were that calm when it happened to you, couldn't you have, you know…<br/>
I'm not saying you shoulda caught him, but isn't it kinda sad for an ace detective to go down that easily…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Naoto.png"/> U-Um…<br/>
Um… To tell you the truth, I was really scared…<br/>
I-I'm sorry…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Yukiko.png"/> It can't be helped.<br/>
None of us could resist the culprit, either. Don't forget, Naoto-kun is younger than us, and she's a girl.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, yeah, that's true. I keep forgetting when I see her talking like this.<br/>
You know, Naoto…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Naoto.png"/> What is it?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yosuke.png"/> You got balls, for a girl.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean seriously, way to go numbnuts.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00132.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Naoto.png"/> We can only watch and wait for him to make the next move…<br/>
But this is no longer a mere job, or someone else's affair. I want to know the truth of why we were targeted.<br/>
Please allow me to join your effort.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We've grown into a pretty solid little team here, I think.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00136.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Naoto.png"/> Thank you very much.<br/>
I'll do my best, Leader.<br/>
&gt; Naoto joined the group!<br/>
&gt; She'll definitely be a strong asset in solving the case.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Maybe we can really do this. Maybe we can really stop this bastard.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Teddie.png"/> Since I'm the King of Geniuses, I knew it would work out this way…<br/>
Ta-da! Nao-chan's glasses!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Naoto.png"/> Th-Thank you…<br/>
They told me about you, Teddie.<br/>
I can sympathize with your drive to find yourself.<br/>
If I may help in any way, let me know.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Teddie.png"/> Wow… What a nice girl!<br/>
&gt; The true culprit is still at large…<br/>
&gt; For now, you'll just have to wait for them to make the next move…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still, all we can do for now is wait and see. And exams. Ugh.</i>
