			<b>6/9/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>I saw that dude who was having an affair with Mayumi Yamano around town, I guess he lives around here.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Namatame.png"/> But I'm helping with the family business now. The life here is nice too…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Poor bastard. Speaking of poor bastards I met up with that kid again at the riverbank.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Lonely Boy:</b> I showed it to them, but they said a grown-up sticker didn't count…<br/>
Here, you can have it back…<br/>
Where am I supposed to find a rare kid's sticker?<br/>
I don't know any…<br/>
&gt; The boy is looking for a rare sticker that is popular among kids.<br/>
&gt; Maybe you should ask some kids for ideas.<br/>
<br/>
<i>More on this later. Anyway, I decided life was too short to be very worried about skipping some school and talked to Ai again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Ai.png"/> Huh? …With you?<br/>
……<br/>
&gt; Ai is staring at you intently…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Ai.png"/> …Whatever.<br/>
You should skip your afternoon classes next time. We'll go somewhere far away.<br/>
&gt; With your overabundant Courage, you're able to slip out of class with ease!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Ai.png"/> I'll invite you to come with me when I feel like it.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I figure it doesn't hurt to make friends with more people who aren't actively involved in this whole murder thing. Anyway, I also heard a disturbing rumor from some girl.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> I hear he started his own gang and goes around bullying people. How did I get to be in the same class as him…?<br/>
He's out snooping around the Practice Building right now. How scary is that?<br/>
&gt; It seems Kanji is bullying people…<br/>
&gt; …Are the rumors true?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Now I figured it was bullshit but I had to go check it out. He was looking in on some club when I got there.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> I-I wasn't peeping inside! It's not like that!<br/>
…So, why are you making that scary face at me? Do you have something to tell me?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Souji.png"/> Yes, I do.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> …I see. Let's go somewhere else, then.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed to the flood plain.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> Oh, you here to tell me off or somethin'?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Souji.png"/> I'm just here to talk.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> How come you're soundin' like a cop?<br/>
So, what is it?<br/>
&gt; You asked Kanji about his ties to the gang of bullies…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> Eh? Bullies? M-Me!?<br/>
Senpai, you suspecting me!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I didn't really think he'd do it but I had to ask him.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> Senpai… I didn't do it.<br/>
I mean… Maybe it ain't that easy to trust me, since they say that I was in a gang…<br/>
But you gotta believe me…<br/>
…'s my own fault rumors like that go around, huh…?<br/>
At this rate, I'll be causing trouble for you guys…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Souji.png"/> Don't worry about it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> Senpai…<br/>
……<br/>
Uhh…<br/>
Whenever you got time… Could you maybe hear what I have to say?<br/>
I feel all cramped inside… And I'm too dumb to know what it's about…<br/>
&gt; Clumsy as he is, it seems Kanji is looking for an opportunity to change…<br/>
You feel a faint bond forming between you and Kanji…<br/>
<br/>
<i>These aren't even really a surprise anymore.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> To make sure I don't cause you any trouble…<br/>
Huh…<br/>
……<br/>
Well, I guess I should smack that gang of bullies around?<br/>
&gt; You talked with Kanji for a while and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yeah I don't quite think Kanji got the point but I guess that's okay. Oh and I asked Nanako about those stickers.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Maybe you should ask Nanako about them…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> Big bro…?<br/>
A children's sticker?<br/>
Ummm… I'll go look.<br/>
&gt; Nanako came back with a sticker.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> This is pretty popular.<br/>
Here you go.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Souji.png"/> Thank you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> *giggle *<br/>
&gt; Nanako gave you Tankiriman Sticker.<br/>
&gt; You should try giving this to the boy who wants friends…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I also had a talk with Dojima, who is seriously the most suspicious guy in the whole wide world.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00077.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dojima.png"/> About… Well…<br/>
I heard you guys hang out at Junes pretty often.<br/>
&gt; Dojima's probing stare hurts…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dojima.png"/> Nothing wrong with that, of course.<br/>
The question is…<br/>
Why do you make so many trips to and from the electronics department?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Luckily I was saved by Nanako.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00084.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dojima.png"/> Oh, er, this isn't what you think. I'm not interrogating him…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> It's not fair. You're always talking with big bro.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dojima.png"/> What…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> I mean… Today, you're home, but…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dojima.png"/> …I always talk with you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> When is always?<br/>
I…<br/>
I wanna… talk…<br/>
&gt; Nanako rubs her eyes sleepily as she says it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dojima.png"/> *sigh * It's bedtime for you already.<br/>
Go to sleep. I'll play with you… next time.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> …You promised.<br/>
&gt; Nanako reluctantly returned to her room…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dojima.png"/> "When is always," huh…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>It didn't seem like Dojima was very good at talking with Nanako.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dojima.png"/> No… It's not that.<br/>
I mean, I am bad with kids, but that's not the problem…<br/>
&gt; Dojima's expression looks bitter…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dojima.png"/> Truth is, I mostly left raising her up to my wife… her mother…<br/>
So… I don't really know how to approach her.<br/>
Plus… I'm not fit to be her family…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Even if he feels that way, he's all she's got.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00107.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dojima.png"/> …Maybe you're right.<br/>
&gt; Dojima is smiling wryly.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dojima.png"/> You think just being related by blood makes you "family"?<br/>
……<br/>
That's not the case…<br/>
&gt; You feel you began to grasp the worries Dojima carries inside him…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I still don't know why it is that he's like this, though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00114.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dojima.png"/> Oh… sorry. You didn't need to hear about that.<br/>
Get some sleep. 'Night.<br/>
&gt; You said good night to Dojima and went to your room.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We need to be more careful, though. We can't forget the police are watching.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> Who do you think'll show up on the Midnight Channel next?<br/>
I heard it's going to rain this evening, but it's not going to last all night.<br/>
Hey, have you been trying to solve the case on your own in your spare time?<br/>
I know, I should be thinking about it, too. But that kind of stuff just isn't my specialty.<br/>
How about you?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I've been thinking it through but I'm not making much headway.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00126.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> I'm jealous.<br/>
Well, everyone has strengths and weaknesses. I'll stick to kicking things.<br/>
So let's prepare ourselves! Times like this are perfect for working out!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We got together to eat some lunch, and discussion moved to the upcoming school campout.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00130.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yukiko.png"/> You know, the rainy season's just about here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Yosuke.png"/> Isn't it a little early?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yukiko.png"/> Once it starts, it'll be raining every night. We'll have to keep a constant eye on the Midnight Channel.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Yosuke.png"/> Crap, I didn't even think of that… Well, so it goes.<br/>
Hehe, I thought you were worried about the rain 'cause of the school campout.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> Why are you so excited about that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yukiko.png"/> That's right, it's the first time for you two…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> You realize the only purpose of the school campout is to "develop a love for one's hometown in young people," right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, they tell us that up front. So?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> Well you see, the way we supposedly develop that love is by picking up trash of the mountain.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Yosuke.png"/> P-Picking up trash? "Develop a love" my ass! That's slave labor!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> Well, the night's kinda fun. We cook our own meals with mess kits and sleep in tents.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yukiko.png"/> The four of us are in the same group.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Poor Yosuke still had some hope that this wasn't going to be absolutely terrible.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00145.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> You wish! Guys and girls sleep in different tents!<br/>
I'm warning ya… If you leave your tent at night, you'll be expelled on the spot.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Yosuke.png"/> Ugh… This gets worse and worse. I thought it was gonna be fun…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yukiko.png"/> It's only for one night and we disband before noon the next day. It doesn't last very long.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> Oh… We did have some fun at the river before going home last year.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Yosuke.png"/> Do they let you go swimming?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Chie.png"/> I think so? There's always someone who takes a dip, although we didn't.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Yosuke.png"/> I see… So you can swim in the river…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke looked very thoughtful after that. God only knows what he's up to. Anyway, it was raining pretty heavily so I stopped by Junes to dry out and ran into Dojima's partner.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00154.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Adachi.png"/> Uhhh, well, I was buying a toy, and this magic set was on sale, you see.<br/>
It was so cheap, I couldn't resist! You know how it is.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Good to know we've got such dedicated officers on the case. I grabbed an Aiya bowl to try to combat my crippling depression and then went home. I decided to see what Nanako was up to.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00157.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> Dad's late again today…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Just then we got a call.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00159.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> Dad!<br/>
Huh… Really!?<br/>
Okay… Okay, I understand.<br/>
Dad's coming home now.<br/>
I need to get dinner ready.<br/>
&gt; Nanako is in high spirits.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> We're out of pickled radish…<br/>
Dad'll be disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I figured as long as we went together it'd be okay for us to go get some.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00168.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> Really?<br/>
Thanks, big bro!!<br/>
&gt; Nanako looks really happy.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> *giggle * We're going shopping together!<br/>
&gt; Nanako looks happy…<br/>
&gt; You feel Nanako's affection for you, and that your relationship with her has grown deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean the killer's not after either of us.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00175.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> Let's go, big bro!!<br/>
&gt; You went to Junes with Nanako.<br/>
&gt; A while later, at the house…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dojima was already home when we got back.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00181.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> Dad! Welcome home!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dojima.png"/> Where did you go at this time of night?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> Oh, uhh… Junes…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dojima.png"/> Didn't I tell you not to go outside this late?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> B-But, you were coming home… so I…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dojima.png"/> No matter what your reason was, rules are rules. You promised me, remember?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> ……<br/>
&gt; Nanako looks sad…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It really was my fault, though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-P4-00191.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> Big bro…<br/>
&gt; Nanako looks relieved.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> …It's not my fault? Then why is Dad angry…?<br/>
Why won't he listen…?<br/>
Dad's stupid…!<br/>
Stupid, stupid!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dojima.png"/> Nanako! How dare you call your father stupid!!<br/>
&gt; You explained to Dojima why you went with Nanako to Junes…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dojima.png"/> Pickled radish… for me…?<br/>
…Is that so.<br/>
……<br/>
But I still can't allow kids to be walking around this late at night.<br/>
You know how dangerous it's been lately. You shouldn't be wandering around out there at night either!<br/>
&gt; Dojima yelled at you, too…<br/>
&gt; You decided to go back to your room.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yeah won't do that again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>6/11/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Not much happened today, played some soccer, talked to Nanako, worried about who might appear on the Midnight Channel next. Nobody's been on the news, though, so I guess the killer doesn't have a target yet.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>6/12/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukiko called me up, she wanted me to try some of the food she'd been cooking.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-P4-00218.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Yukiko handed you a hand-made boxed lunch…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yukiko.png"/> It came out well, so I packed it up. Try it out.<br/>
&gt; It looks normal…<br/>
&gt; ……?<br/>
&gt; For some reason, an unusually pungent smell hangs in the air…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I tried to at least act enthusiastic.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-P4-00224.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yukiko.png"/> Go ahead!<br/>
&gt; Yukiko is looking at you expectantly…<br/>
&gt; It seems you have no choice but to eat it…<br/>
&gt; You started with the… omelette-looking… thing…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; It's actually soft…<br/>
&gt; ……?<br/>
&gt; There's something too hard to bite on inside…<br/>
&gt; And it smells burnt, yet raw…<br/>
&gt; You worry that your body will reject the foreign matter…<br/>
&gt; You were finally able to swallow it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yukiko.png"/> …You're not about to tell me how delicious that was, are you?<br/>
……<br/>
&gt; Yukiko looks sad…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean Rome wasn't built in a day.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-P4-00239.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yukiko.png"/> I-I suppose… Thank you.<br/>
&gt; Yukiko seems relieved…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nanako had gone out for something and came by just then.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-P4-00242.jpg"/><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yukiko.png"/> Ah, Nanako-chan… Well, I was just having him try my boxed lunch…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> Ooh, I want some.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yukiko.png"/> I-I'm sorry, but I can't give you any. It's not good…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> Oh. If you make a good one, will you let me have some?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yukiko.png"/> Huh…? S-Sure, if you want…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> Yay! I'm rooting for you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yukiko.png"/> Nanako-chan…<br/>
Thank you. I'll do my best, okay?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Nanako.png"/> I need to go now.<br/>
I'm going to Mai-chan's house. By!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yukiko.png"/> Be careful.<br/>
Umm… I'm sorry to drag you around…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Even with the food this wasn't a bad time.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-P4-00255.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yukiko.png"/> R-Really? I'm glad to hear that…<br/>
&gt; Yukiko seems relieved…<br/>
&gt; You can sense that Yukiko is relying on you…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship has grown deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>She just needs more practice. A lot more.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-P4-00260.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yukiko.png"/> Only about a year left, huh…?<br/>
I need to be able to do anything on my own by then…<br/>
&gt; You handed Yukiko the rest of the boxed lunch and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I guess Nanako had gone to Junes because there was enough food for me to cook some lunch.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-P4-00270.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You have the ingredients to make potato salad.<br/>
&gt; You decided to make potato salad.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; What should you do after boiling the potatoes?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Easy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-P4-00275.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You added ham, onions, and other ingredients after smashing the potatoes.<br/>
&gt; Obtained Tasty Potato Salad.<br/>
&gt; …In addition, you made Bait x 3 from the leftovers.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I should do this more often.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>6/13/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I heard a sort of heartening thing this morning on the way in to school.</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>Dark-Haired Girl:</b> Ah, it's finally time to break out the summer wardrobe.<br/>
<b>Athletic Girl:</b> So refreshing!<br/>
I hope it's not going to get cold again with all this rain…<br/>
<b>Dark-Haired Girl:</b> I don't think we'll have to worry about that this year.<br/>
I heard there's going to be less rain than there was last year.<br/>
<br/>
<i>After yesterday I decided to treat Yukiko to my own cooking.</i><br/>

<br/>
&gt; You ate lunch with Yukiko.<br/>
&gt; You ate Tasty Potato Salad together.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yukiko.png"/> Oh, it's really good! Did you make this on your own, Souji-kun?<br/>
The flavor is excellent, and the presentation is great, too… Do you want to work as a chef at our place?<br/>
I'm just kidding…<br/>
…Though you'd be more than welcome if you wanted to…<br/>
&gt; It was Yukiko's favorite!<br/>
<br/>
<i>After lunch we had P.E., and Mr. Kondo tried to trip me up again.</i><br/>

<b>Mr. Kondo:</b> June in Japan can be pretty tiring, thanks to all the humidity and heat!<br/>
But don't waste your days away with laziness! Summer is very near, my friends!<br/>
You wouldn't want that special someone to see you being lazy, would you?<br/>
So today, let's do 30 reps of the 100 meter dash! Running keeps the body and mind from rotting away!<br/>
…What's with that sourpuss face, Souji? Do you want it to freeze like that?<br/>
Okay, okay, how 'bout this? If you get this question right, I'll cut it down to five!<br/>
What kind of exercise is a sprint classified as?<br/>
<br/>
<i>This was a sort of tricky one honestly but he can't defeat my mastery of the trivial.</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>Mr. Kondo:</b> Ugh…! So you knew! I didn't think you were that informed about athletics, Souji!<br/>
Well, a promise is a promise! I'll make it five instead of 30!<br/>
But I only promised Souji! Hahaha! Everyone else, you have ten reps, got it!? Get ready!<br/>
<br/>
<i>That kid was back on the floodplain, so I gave him that sticker Nanako gave to me.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Lonely Boy:</b> I can't come up with anything…<br/>
&gt; The boy is looking around for a rare sticker that is popular among kids.<br/>
<b>Lonely Boy:</b> …A Tankiriman Sticker?<br/>
Wow, thank you!<br/>
This is cool-looking, so I'm sure they'll let me play after I show them this!<br/>
&gt; The boy ran off cheerfully.<br/>
&gt; Will he make lots of friends…? You should ask him another time.<br/>

<i>Yumi wasn't at drama, so I headed to the hospital to check on her. In her own way she's doing just as poorly as her father.</i>
