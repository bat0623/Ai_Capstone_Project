			<b>7/18/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>It was Ocean Day today, so we didn't have school. I headed to the shopping district and ran into Chie. After some training, we headed to Aiya.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Mmmm… The meat and rice just flow through my veins…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> Looks delicious.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> I can't recommend the steak bowl enough!<br/>
Their sauce is to die for!<br/>
&gt; A huge smile spread over Chie's face.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> I need to work hard and pump myself up, or else I can't pull us out of a jam, right?<br/>
Especially Yukiko… I need to be able to protect her…<br/>
……<br/>
I hope she's not straining herself. Makes you worry, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm a bit worried myself when we go into battle, so I agreed with her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Thanks… That's what makes you the leader…<br/>
&gt; Chie seems relieved…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> I'll make myself stronger! For Yukiko, too!<br/>
So keep it up, Leader!<br/>
Me and Yosuke act like that all the time…<br/>
But we're all counting on you… Heheh…<br/>
&gt; You can sense Chie's burning passion…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Chie has grown yet deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie seems especially determined now.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> …All this talking is making me hungry.<br/>
'Scuse me! Another fried rice with meat, please!<br/>
How about you?<br/>
&gt; You talked with Chie for a while…<br/>
&gt; You walked home partway with Chie.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided to get the stupidest thing I could possibly do out of the way before exams.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; There's a bitter melon with a bite taken out of it…<br/>
&gt; Someone probably mistook it for a cucumber…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; Eat it…?<br/>
&gt; …<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; ………<br/>
&gt; The raw bitter melon was very bitter. So, so bitter.<br/>
&gt; Your Courage has greatly increased.<br/>
&gt; However…<br/>
&gt; You don't feel well…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You decided to go to bed early today…<br/>
<br/>
<i>God damn was that bitter. They don't call them that for nothing.</i><br/>
<br/>

<i>I think I did even better this time.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yosuke.png"/> *yawn * I'm sooo sleepy…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Yuck! Don't yawn in my face like that!<br/>
Hey, for the third question on the English test, which phrase did you choose?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Yukiko.png"/> Um… I went with "used to."<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Wrong again…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yosuke.png"/> So much for Chie going abroad. Heck, why leave Inaba? You have so much right here!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Ooooh, you're so annoying!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Kanji.png"/> Yo…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Rise.png"/> No more encores…<br/>
I mean… Hi everyone…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yosuke.png"/> Whoa, more losers!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Rise.png"/> What do I need to know English for!? I can always ask for a translator!<br/>
How did you do, Senpai?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was certainly feeling confident.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Rise.png"/> Wow, you're amazing…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Kanji.png"/> Enough about the exams already…<br/>
What's going on with the murder case?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yosuke.png"/> Hm… Why don't we head to our special headquarters? We haven't been there in a while.<br/>
&gt; You decided to get together at the Junes food court.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Talking about death was sort of refreshing after exams.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00107.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Not just because exams are over, but… The whole thing with the police finding a suspect.<br/>
I mean, we believed that only we could solve this case. And now…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yosuke.png"/> Well, we still don't know yet. They haven't made an arrest.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Kanji.png"/> So… we gotta sit on our thumbs.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Of course with crack detectives like we have in Inaba working on the case it's sure to be resolved immediately.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00112.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Adachi.png"/> We're at the end of our rope here…<br/>
Y-You guys!? D-Did you hear what I said?<br/>
Ah… Ahahaha! This case is as good as solved!<br/>
Don't worry, kids. It's only a matter of time before we bring in the suspect.<br/>
I mean, the guy's kidnapping people at random and slaughtering them! We won't rest until we bring him to justice!<br/>
I-I gotta get going!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yosuke.png"/> Now I'm REALLY worried…<br/>
On the other hand… If the police have a search warrant out for the guy, we should stay out of it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Kanji.png"/> Yeah…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Rise.png"/> Oh, uh, I just remembered. There was a question on the exam that I didn't get.<br/>
I think it was, "The chemical formula HCHO, used for silver mirror reactions. Its 40% solution is known as formalin."<br/>
And the question was, "What is HCHO?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>I pretty much just said it automatically.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00125.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Rise.png"/> Oh, I see. I chose acetic acid… Duh, of course it couldn't have been vinegar.<br/>
Hey, you had that question too, didn't you Kanji?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Kanji.png"/> Shut up. And don't call me by my first name.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Rise.png"/> Wow, kinda harsh, aren't you? I heard you got a nosebleed when you were around our senpai.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Kanji.png"/> H-Hey! Who the hell blabbed about that!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> A-Anyways!<br/>
Rise-chan, why don't you ask Yukiko to help you study?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Rise.png"/> Huh? I guess, but wouldn't you rather ask a senpai of the opposite sex?<br/>
Senpai… I'm not a nuisance to you, am I?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Damn…<br/>
This girl's dangerous…!<br/>
L-Let's change the subject.<br/>
Hey, any idea how Teddie's doing?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yosuke.png"/> Oh yeah, I forgot to mention it to you.<br/>
Check this out.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I hadn't really noticed but Teddie was indeed nearby.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yosuke.png"/> I let him stay at my place. In return, he's now our official store mascot.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Kanji.png"/> Aaah! So he's hiding in plain sight. Reverse psychology, huh?<br/>
Man… He looks like one happy bear…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Yosuke.png"/> He kept saying that he didn't wanna go back. So I made him a deal.<br/>
Now, since I've got nothing better to do… I'm gonna go bug him.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Oooh, I wanna go too!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Kanji.png"/> C-Can I… feel his soft fur…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>They all left except for Rise, who stayed behind.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-P4-00150.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Rise.png"/> Now that I'm getting the hang of school, I want to go out more and see the sights.<br/>
But I tend to get recognized everywhere I go, so I'm a little nervous about going out on my own…<br/>
And you seem like the type of guy who knows all the cool spots in town.<br/>
……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> Sure, I'll show you around.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Rise.png"/> Really? Woohoo!<br/>
&gt; You sense Rise's natural, easy friendliness…<br/>
&gt; You feel a faint bond forming between you and Rise…<br/>
<br/>
<i>These really don't surprise me anymore.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-P4-00159.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Rise.png"/> If you ever have some time to kill, think of me, okay?<br/>
Now c'mon, let's go pester Teddie.<br/>
Teddieeee! Heeeey!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh, and Nanako is getting more and more worried about this.</i><br/>
