<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Wait… If we can't beat 'em on size, we're totally sunk…<br/>
<b>Gekkoukan Principal:</b> Well, uh, next I will explain about our fine educational institution and the reasons for its establishment!<br/>
Uh, I'd like to start with a proverb… "If a job's worth doing, it's worth doing well."<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> *yawn * Is this principal in love with his own voice or what…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Chie! He'll hear you!<br/>
<b>Gekkoukan Principal:</b> Ah-hem… Our school is closed today, but, ahh, because of this rare opportunity for cultural exchange…<br/>
Some of our students will walk you through these halls. First, though, a student body representative will say a few words…<br/>
<br/>
<i>They do certainly have some cute girls in Port Island, I'll grant that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chihiro.png"/> Welcome to Gekkoukan High School.<br/>
My name is Chihiro Fushimi. I'm a third-year student, and the Student Council President here at Gekkoukan.<br/>
It's an honor to meet you all today.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Holy crap, that girl's unbelievable!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kanji.png"/> Yeah, you're right… She is cute…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I gotta say… She's the most bewitching bespectacled beauty I've ever beheld…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> You guys… Stop overreacting!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chihiro.png"/> This is the first time our school has invited another student body for a true cultural exchange.<br/>
To learn about others is to learn about oneself, and is the first step on the road to self-betterment… This I believe.<br/>
To ensure a worthwhile experience for each and every one of you, we will do our best to help you accomplish that.<br/>
So let us enjoy our time together! Thank you very much.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> …She beat me in every category…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kashiwagi.png"/> Alright, everyone get into groups with your classmates!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Everyone ran off, it seems a bit ahead of schedule.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chihiro.png"/> Excuse me, could I bother you for a moment?<br/>
This is today's schedule for everyone. Could you hand it out later, please?<br/>
I forgot to do it myself…<br/>
Sorry to be so disorganized. And you all came so far…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Souji.png"/> Don't worry.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chihiro.png"/> *chuckle * Thank you.<br/>
In fact, I didn't write the speech on my own. One of the former Student Council Presidents helped me.<br/>
She was the president, my first year here, and she was amazing… I always looked up to her.<br/>
I should call her later and tell her the speech was a success!<br/>
Oh, I'm sorry! Listen to me, going on and on about myself… I have to stop babbling when I got nervous.<br/>
Um, your group is scheduled for a special lecture soon. The classroom is on the second floor.<br/>
I have some arrangements to make with your student council, so please excuse me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Did I just hear her say "special lecture"?<br/>
We came all this way to be lectured!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Let's see, our class is…<br/>
It's being taught by someone named Mr. Edogawa. The lecture's about Qabbalah…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Kabawhat?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kanji.png"/> You don't know? It's a casino.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh Kanji. At least Chie admitted she didn't know what it was.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Uhh… We don't get one.<br/>
We have classes all through today. Tonight and tomorrow, we'll be staying at a hotel…<br/>
We'll have free time tomorrow and the day after, until we leave at noon.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> You gotta be kidding me…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Come on, guys! Let's focus on our studies for now, so we can enjoy our free time later!<br/>
<br/>
<i>The lecture, as it turned out, wasn't about Qabbalah, but something else.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Edogawa.png"/> My name is Edogawa, and I'll be keeping you company for this period.<br/>
You are all from Yasogami High, eh…? Aaah, a high school of many gods.<br/>
I had considered a lecture on Qabbalah philosophy… but I have a better idea. Eeeheehee…<br/>
Since I was able to meet you all today, I shall tell you a story of partings.<br/>
One could say that this is Japan's oldest tale of curses.<br/>
You all know about the gods who created this country, I assume?<br/>
The two gods who gave birth to this country are the god Izanagi and the goddess Izanami.<br/>
They got along very well…<br/>
But one day, Izanami died when giving birth to Kagutsuchi, the fire god.<br/>
Extremely saddened by this, Izanagi left for the land of the dead to bring back Izanami.<br/>
Yomi… The dark, dark underworld…<br/>
There, Izanagi asked Izanami, who had become a dweller in that land of shadows, to come back with him to the land above.<br/>
The goddess replied by saying she would negotiate with the god of the underworld, and asked Izanagi to wait for her.<br/>
However…<br/>
Izanagi became curious to know what was going on, so he broke his promise and set his comb alight to look around.<br/>
What he saw… was the goddess Izanami, whose body was completely covered in filth and maggots!<br/>
Terrified, Izanagi ran away, but the enraged Izanami chased after him!<br/>
After dodging the many demons sent after him, Izanagi reached the entrance of the underworld, Yomotsu Hirasaka…<br/>
He set in place a large boulder as a barrier between the two worlds, and got away unharmed.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's sort of an odd coincidence that he'd tell the story of Izanagi given that was my first Persona.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Edogawa.png"/> This is the curse known as the "kotodo."<br/>
Curses beget curses… and Izanami said to the god:<br/>
"If you're going to treat me this way, I will kill 1,000 humans in your world each day!"<br/>
Izanagi regretfully accepted that the bonds between them were severed, saying:<br/>
"Then I shall give life to 1,500 each day."<br/>
Thousands die, and ten thousands are born.<br/>
That is the curse upon this country.<br/>
…Many of you may have already known this famous story.<br/>
Now, the etymology… The names Izanagi and Izanami come from the word "izanau," which means "to invite."<br/>
I'd be delighted if you have accepted this story today as an "invitation" to acquiring knowledge.<br/>
That reminds me… In the olden days, people took this story seriously…<br/>
Things such as lighting only one fire at night and throwing combs were taboo.<br/>
By the way, at Hana no Iwaya, the grave where Izanami is said to have descended to the underworld…<br/>
To this day, people decorate it with flowers when they hold festivals nearby.<br/>
It may be merely ceremonial, but everyone wants to look beautiful.<br/>
It's how they show their consideration to the goddess who may feel that way. Eeeheehee…<br/>
Ahhh, is our time up already?<br/>
I may have gone on too long… Eeeheehee…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Well, at least that creepy dude doesn't teach at our school. That's something we've got on Gekkoukan High. At least, I thought that until we saw the goddamn hotel Kashiwagi had booked.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kashiwagi.png"/> We'll be staying here tonight.<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> Is this… really a regular hotel…?<br/>
&gt; A wave of agitation seems to be spreading through the group.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kashiwagi.png"/> So what do you think? It was me who found this place.<br/>
It just opened not too long ago. It's got that modern look-and the price was right!<br/>
Personally, I think it was an excellent choice.<br/>
<b>Doubtful Student:</b> We're staying here…?<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> I mean the sign says "hotel," but…<br/>
<b>Dumbfounded Student:</b> It opened recently…? Dude, this totally looks like a lov-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kashiwagi.png"/> You there! Don't just stand there! Keep marching in.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Isn't there something funny about this place…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Is there? We don't have these modern hotels in Inaba, so I can't tell.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Rise confirmed this place was pretty shady.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00107.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Th-That's all right, Rise. I don't think I wanna know…<br/>
<b>Mysterious Voice:</b> Hmhmhm… Faster than I expected..<br/>
This is quite the hotel.<br/>
If they were to meet me… I wonder, what would the look on Yosuke's face be…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> ……!? Who's that!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Teddie had followed us!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00113.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> *gasp * It can't be…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Teddie.png"/> Haaa!<br/>
Hmhmhm… Shoo bee doo bee…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kanji.png"/> Teddie!? What're you doing here!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Teddie.png"/> There lonely bear inside of me went stir crazy!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> Grrr… If only I could detect people in the real world…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> How did you come here!? Do you have some special ability!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Teddie.png"/> No, I took the train.<br/>
I swore off Topsicles and saved up the money I got working at Junes.<br/>
I knew where you were going, thanks to Yosuke's "Trip Guide."<br/>
You guys have free time tomorrow, right? No use hiding it! I already know!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> How in the world did you make it here looking like that…?<br/>
I mean, why wear the bear suit here!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Teddie.png"/> I almost got thrown in the trash a couple times.<br/>
But I kept hanging onto the promise Chie-chan made to go on a date with me!<br/>
That's what gave me strength to carry on!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Uh, g-good job, Teddie…<br/>
D-Did I promise that…? Oh yeah… I do remember saying that I'd go out with you someday…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Teddie has a very good memory for things like that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00133.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Teddie.png"/> You remembered, Chie-chan! Is it okay with Yuki-chan and Rise-chan too!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Let's all go together, then. Is that all right with you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Teddie.png"/> Mmm… It's a deal!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> I've been here before, so I'll show you around tomorrow.<br/>
I guess we can go shopping first. And I know a great place we can hit later on.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Teddie.png"/> Ooh, shopping. That sounds great! *chuckle *<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> The other students don't know Port Island that well, so they're just gonna go wherever the school recommends.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Well, I guess a shopping spree beats a factory tour. Alright, we're in too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> *chuckle * Leave it to me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Now… before the fun starts…<br/>
*sigh * We gotta deal with this guy.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kanji.png"/> Can't you sleep outside for the night? That suit should keep ya nice and cozy.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Teddie.png"/> Cruelty to animals! You don't know how much trouble I went through to get here!<br/>
I took the slow train all this way! Do you hear!? The slow train!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Eventually Kashiwagi realized none of us were in the hotel, which gave us a scare.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00148.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Crap…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kashiwagi.png"/> What's the matter? …Oh? What's this giant teddy bear?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Souji.png"/> A souvenir.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kashiwagi.png"/> My… It's so big…<br/>
Go oh, hurry on inside with it.<br/>
By the way, these rooms are amazing. Every room has a waterbed!<br/>
But don't flip the wrong switch when you're turning on the lights, or your bed will start spinning.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> A-Anyways, I'm looking forward to tomorrow…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, but I'm exhausted… For so many reasons…<br/>
&gt; In any event, you have to do something about Teddie…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Teddie.png"/> ……<br/>
&gt; Teddie is doing his best to act like a stuffed animal…<br/>
&gt; Coming this far may be Teddie's way of showing how much he genuinely likes you all…<br/>
&gt; You sense Teddie's strong trust…<br/>
<br/>
<i>By the way when staying in scenic Port Island I cannot recommend the Seaside Clamshell Inn because it's creepy as hell.</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>We had a bit of a surprise there too.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Wh-What!? Dude, look who's talking! You were here before we were!<br/>
That's right… I guess if the first-years came on the trip, you'd be here too…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> The clientele here seems above-board, so I don't expect there'll be any problems.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Huh? You're leaving?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Why don't you join us?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> Are you… asking me to stay?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Uh-huh. We didn't get to chat last time.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> Ah… I… I-It's just that I had some matters to attend to that day.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> Well, you're free now, right?<br/>
I was really eager to talk to you. I'm curious how someone my age is working as a detective.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> How about it?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> Hmmm… Very well, if you insist.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Huh? What's up? You look a little red…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> Th-That's not true!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> Wait here. I'll go reserve the area upstairs for us.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Okay.<br/>
…Wait, what!? Reserve!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> Yep. Don't worry, I think I can pull some strings.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kanji.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> …What's wrong, man? Stomach pains?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kanji.png"/> Th-That ain't it.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Are you sure this is all right? Isn't it expensive…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> No worries.<br/>
Two years ago when I had a secret show here, the power went out in the middle of it, and the gig was cancelled.<br/>
They still owe me from then, so they're willing to put this one on the house.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Well in that case, I'm gonna order more.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Teddie2.png"/> Whooooo! I'm not gonna hold back either!<br/>

Times like this, adults play the King's Game. It's the law… *hic *<br/>
What's their problem…? They make me act like a ditz, call me Risette and stuff, and then say I'm a kid… *hic *<br/>
It's so obvious… Those wrap parties get a lot funner after I go home!<br/>
Morooons! I'm gonna play the King's Game now and ain't no one gonna stop me!<br/>

Aaaagh! Noooo! Heeeelp!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> Ohooo… Only the first round, and two contestants have dropped out already.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Huh? Is it that kind of game?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> On to round two!<br/>
&gt; You must be very careful here… Which stick should you draw…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I had a really good feeling about the closest one to me this time.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00259.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; …There's a red mark on it! You're the next King!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> Who's the King?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Phew, someone decent… No crazy orders this time…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> That's not how it goes! If the last King demanded a smooch, then the next order's gotta be more extreme.<br/>
Chiiieee, don't be such a party pooper… Ahahahaha!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> Heyyy! The person who gets picked should have to rest their head on the King's lap.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Nah, make 'em sit on his lap.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> Oh! Or they could have to hug him!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Better than that… A piggyback ride!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> C'mon, King! Who's gonna do what!?<br/>
&gt; Everyone is staring at you…<br/>
&gt; What will your orders be…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>In retrospect choosing based on intuition was absolutely idiotic.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00274.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Wha--!? There's three girls here and I get chosen!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> The King's order is…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Absolute! Ahahaha!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> A piggyback ride? Not cool, man! Not! Cool!<br/>
<br/>
<i>God damn was that lame.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00279.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> ……<br/>
…You've had enough, right? Please? Show some mercy…<br/>
&gt; You suffered along with Yosuke…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kanji had finally dealt with Teddie, and they rejoined the group.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00284.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> You didn't even draw a chopstick!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Alright, then… Let's have someone talk about something really embarrassing that they'd never wanna tell anyone!<br/>
Hrmmm, let's see… Ah! Naoto-kun! I choose you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> She's breaking all the rules… Just ignore her, Naoto.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> No… No, that won't be necessary.<br/>
One stipulation, though: If I do this, the rest of you must reveal "something" as well.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> Okaaay!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> No particularly embarrassing experiences come to mind… Would discussing my life be fair game?<br/>
It's the rare situation like this that gives me call to speak of such things.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Damn… Way to kill the mood…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> The Shirogane family has been detectives for generations now. We lend our powers to the police from time to time.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> For generations? Wow, it's like that guy from a movie I watched before. What was his name… Kuzu…noha?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> In days gone by, when there were no crime scene investigators, consulting detectives were considered more valuable.<br/>
Thus, my grandfather still has a strong connection with the police and looks after me, despite my youth and inexperience.<br/>
But investigators nowadays are well versed in science and medicine, so I must further my studies.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> That sounds tough…<br/>
……<br/>
…That's it? No punch line?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm not sure I totally believed what Naoto was telling us anyway, nobody's got absolutely nothing embarrassing to tell. So I don't feel bad about not answering the follow-up question.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-P4-00305.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> That's sooo embarrassing! Isn't Naoto-kun embarrassing?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I wanna go home…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> Phew… I'm sleepy.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> Well then, it's your turn now.<br/>
A straight answer, please. What is your true involvement with the murder case?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> You know, you're so good at killing the mood that it's almost funny…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Weeeeell, we go rescuing people who've been kidnapped by jumping into the TV!<br/>
And theeen, we do stuff like, "Persona!" with our Personas and beat the crap outta Shadows…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Y-You idiot…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> *sigh * Are you making fun of me?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> Ish true!<br/>
Personaaaa!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Sheesh! Somebody put these two drunks to bed already!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> …I see now that you had no intention of telling me the truth.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm going to be honest I'd been wondering this too since about the start of the King's Game because it was fruit juice for god's sake.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-P4-00320.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Good one, Naoto!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> No, I confirmed it when I first entered. No alcohol has been served here since a rash of drunk driving last year.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Huh…? Does that mean we're all just drunk off the atmosphere?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Whooo caaares…<br/>
Whee, I feel so good… Goood niiiiight…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kanji.png"/> Hey, Senpai! …How the hell're we gonna get back with two passed-out drunks!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> *sigh * All this is giving me a big headache… Is this what a hangover feels like…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Teddie2.png"/> Teddie's still totally okay!<br/>
Lesh keep drinking 'til mornin'!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> Bring it oooon…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> As I said… you haven't been drinking alcohol!<br/>

<i>We stopped for ramen at a place that Rise said was good near the station. Naoto came along as well, I think he's still trying to get an answer to that question from last night.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> This place serves the best ramen in town.<br/>
When we were filming, a lot of times I came here instead of eating boxed lunches.<br/>
Huh…? You're not hungry?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Um… What happened last night…? I don't remember much about it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> Oh, I think the two of us fell asleep quick. I heard it got pretty wild, though.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> I see… I don't remember at all…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> Ahh, this flavor never changes.<br/>
I couldn't come here too often because it's high in carbohydrates, so being able to eat as much as I want is like a dream!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Oh… This is delicious! It has an interesting taste that makes you hungry for more.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> See? See?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Teddie.png"/> Another bowl, please! Keep the noodles hard!<br/>
<b>Young Man:</b> Um, I'll have the Hagakure Bowl.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> The Hagakure Bowl's a normal menu item now…!? Argh, I should've asked!<br/>
Oh well. This is just as good.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, is it okay for you to be out in the open like this?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> Sure, no prob.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think Rise's been enjoying being out of the public eye while here.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-P4-00354.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> That's just how it is over here. Plus, I'm barely wearing any makeup.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Oh, you're right. There's a lot of autographs on display.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Y'know what I think? The reason they don't notice you is 'cause this bear sticks out like a sore thumb…<br/>
I guess if he wore that over here, he'll have to go home wearing it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kanji.png"/> Isn't it all steamy inside from the ramen?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Huh? Where's my bowl!?<br/>
You didn't eat it… did you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Teddie.png"/> Y-You didn't finish, so… Ahaha.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> I was going to finish it!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, didn't you just order more a second ago? How many have you eaten?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Teddie.png"/> I dunno how to count.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> You little liar! Gimme that check! Let's see here…<br/>
One, two… T-Ten bowls!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Teddie.png"/> Yuki-chan's makes it eleven. *burp *<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> I was going to finish mine…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Th-There, there…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> I'm sorry to interrupt, but it's close to the meeting time.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Awww… Already?<br/>
I thought the trip was gonna be a bore… But now that it's over, I actually had a good time.<br/>
Hey, let's buy a souvenir at the station. I bet Nanako-chan will be expecting one.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided to get her a shirt, I'm not great at creative gifts.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-P4-00375.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Alright, let's get going. C'mon Teddie, we're leaving.<br/>
Yo… Hey, Ted!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kanji.png"/> Don't make me rub your fur the wrong way, you little-<br/>
D-Dude… Hey, he ain't moving!<br/>
I-Is he hibernating!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Hey…<br/>
D-Don't tell me… I-It's not because he's been in our world too long, is it!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Rise.png"/> Are you serious!? Teddie!<br/>
<br/>
<i>It turned out that maybe Teddie shouldn't eat eleven damn bowls of ramen.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-P4-00384.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Teddie.png"/> My tummy's heavy.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Yukiko.png"/> Leave it behind.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Teddie.png"/> I ate too much… Can't move… Someone carry meee.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> I mustn't be late for our rendezvous. Please excuse me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Ah, Yukiko. Wait for me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Teddie.png"/> H-Hey, I really can't move! And I don't have money for a return ticket!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Farewell, Teddie…<br/>
We shall leave you here, along with our memories of youth…<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Nanako.png"/> Welcome home!<br/>
Did you have fun?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Souji.png"/> Come with me next time.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Nanako.png"/> Yep, for sure!<br/>
Um, I wanna go to Destiny Sea too! There's this roller coaster that goes WHOOOSH into the water, and…<br/>
&gt; Nanako is talking about it happily.<br/>
&gt; You remember that you bought a souvenir for Nanako.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Nanako.png"/> Wow! Thanks!<br/>
*nod * Th-Thanks!<br/>
&gt; Nanako thanked you out of modesty…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Nanako.png"/> Oh, hi Dad!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Dojima.png"/> Ah, you're back. We just missed each other, huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Nanako.png"/> Look! My big bro got me a souvenir!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Dojima.png"/> Hey, nice. Did you remember to thank him?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Nanako.png"/> Of course!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Dojima.png"/> Heh, I guess that came out of your own pocket. Thanks.<br/>
You went to Tatsumi Port Island, yeah? Haha, I guess the city was no big deal for a guy like you.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dojima seemed sort of worried about Naoto, which is interesting given how pissed he was earlier in the year.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-P4-00415.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Dojima.png"/> You talk to him much?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Souji.png"/> I guess so, yeah.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Dojima.png"/> He's mature for his age, but he's still a year younger than you…<br/>
Try to make friends with him, will you? He's a cocky brat… but he's honest.<br/>
The higher-ups are losing their patience with him… It doesn't matter if his argument holds water or not.<br/>
At this rate, he won't accomplish anything but getting himself booted off the team…<br/>
Adults can be a selfish bunch.<br/>
&gt; Dojima has a kind look in his eyes…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Dojima.png"/> Oh, sorry. You must be tired.<br/>
Why don't you take a bath? Oh, but don't forget to take your stuff upstairs.<br/>
Nanako! Can you get the bath ready!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Naoto asking what our involvement with the cases was, Dojima hinting that there's conflict in the investigation… This isn't over, is it? I have no proof yet, but now all the nagging loose ends are coming back to me. I guess there's nothing we can do but wait and see. If the Midnight Channel appears again, we'll know for sure…</i>
