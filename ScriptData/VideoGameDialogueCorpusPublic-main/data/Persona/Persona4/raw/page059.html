<b>Guy With A Backpack:</b> It's been raining for a few days, but I heard it's finally supposed to clear up this afternoon.<br/>
<b>Lazy Student:</b> Really? Then I don't have to cancel my plans.<br/>
You know that there's a holiday next week, right? I promised my girlfriend we'd go to Okina together that day.<br/>
I was worried that it might rain that day… Phew!<br/>
<b>Guy With A Backpack:</b> What? If that's the case, then I hope it never stops raining!<br/>
Rain like a waterfall so his date gets cancelled!<br/>
<br/>
<i>When school ended and the rain cleared up, we headed to Junes.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> What's the verdict, Teddie? Is he really in there?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Teddie.png"/> I do smell someone.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> It's just like before… Nothing's changed.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> Like… before…<br/>
Of course! That's why Naoto-kun appeared on the news so suddenly!<br/>
He said something didn't seem right, and that he wasn't convinced.<br/>
He also believed that the people who are kidnapped appear on TV first, remember?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> Wait, you're saying… he's using himself as bait!?<br/>
We came to the same conclusion he did, about how people who become famous through TV would disappear.<br/>
Could he be trying to prove the theory by using himself…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> You mean he got kidnapped on purpose!? That's crazy… He could be killed!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Rise.png"/> He said, "This is not a game former either…"<br/>
It's all my fault… I'm the one that said that to him…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> That idiot! Why the hell didn't he just tell us!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> He knew we'd stop him if he did… Instead, he left us clues so we could figure it out and-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> I know! That son of a…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> B-But… What about the killer the police are holding now?<br/>
Mitsuo did kill King Moron, right?<br/>
<br/>
<i>We can certainly be sure of that, but the others…?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> I get it now…! I remember Naoto-kun mentioning this!<br/>
He said it was strange that the police were able to identify the cause of Mr. Morooka's death!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> Then is King Moron the only one Mitsuo killed…!?<br/>
That'd explain why there were no signs of King Moron being thrown into the TV…<br/>
The killer didn't change his methods for King Moron… It just seemed that way 'cause it was done by someone else!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Rise.png"/> Then whoever kidnapped Naoto-kun… That's the real killer!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> B-But wait a sec…<br/>
Didn't Mitsuo say he was the one behind it all? Why would he take the blame for someone else's crime? Isn't that weird?<br/>
And they said on the news that the culprit confessed to the other murders, too…<br/>
There's also something else that's been bothering me, but… Um…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> To hell with someone who's behind bars!<br/>
If we don't get off our asses, that stupid Naoto's gonna die in there!<br/>
We gotta go find him!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We rushed into the TV to see if we could find Naoto, but just as before no luck.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Teddie.png"/> That's amazing, Rise-chan! There's no way my nose can pick up that much.<br/>
Shall I give you a massage?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> Don't bother her!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Rise.png"/> It's the same as last time… I know he's here, but I can't tell where…<br/>
I need something that'll help me understand him… I need some clues.<br/>
Without that, I have no idea which way we should look…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> Dammit… There's too much we don't know about that kid…<br/>
But if we don't do something, he's gonna…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> Hey, snap out of it! This is just like all the other times.<br/>
Let's not panic, keep an eye on the weather, and do this like always. We'll save him, no problem!<br/>
First, we need to look for something that'll help us locate him.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kanji.png"/> I-I know… I-I wasn't panicking.<br/>
We know he's over here… So all we gotta do is get him out.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Rise.png"/> I'm sorry I couldn't find him…<br/>
All I need is some kind of hint to help me understand him better. Then I could find him for sure!<br/>
&gt; It seems you need more information about Naoto to make any progress.<br/>
&gt; You should ask around about him…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Let's see, where to start. Well, I picked up a new request from the fox, some guy is afraid of cats and needs our help.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided to start out by asking around the school, figured maybe a first-year knew more about him than we did.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> Well, I heard a rumor that there's this girl who saw something peculiar about him…<br/>
I think she usually hangs out in the Practice Building after school. Why don't you go talk to her?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I guess it's a good thing that the rumor mill is so brutal around here.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> Oh, this is interesting! I saw him get really angry.<br/>
I'm not sure what it was about, but he was with a policeman.<br/>
I wonder what happened to make him shout like that.<br/>
This was in the shopping district a little while ago.<br/>
&gt; Naoto was with a policeman earlier…?<br/>
&gt; In any case, you should try to find this policeman…<br/>
<br/>
<i>The police were, as always, not saying anything.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> I'm in the middle of something here, so don't bother me. If school's out, go home already.<br/>
I swear, kids these days…<br/>
&gt; He doesn't seem to be in the mood to talk…<br/>
&gt; It may be best to make a change of plans.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was trying to figure out how to get something from the cops when I ran into Chie by the river. She had a great idea.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00086.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chie.png"/> I guess it's no good unless we act like we're Naoto-kun's friends and we're worried about him…<br/>
Like, "Naoto hasn't been to school recently and we're getting worried. Is he busy with police work?"<br/>
Why not ask them something like that?<br/>
&gt; …Chie's suggestion does seem to make sense.<br/>
&gt; Next time you speak to the police, you should try that…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I returned to talk to the police again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00092.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You told him that Naoto hasn't been coming to school lately and that you're worried…<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> Shirogane…? Do you know him?<br/>
I haven't seen him at the station lately, either.<br/>
Funny, it wasn't that long ago that he'd be around well into the night, looking through the files.<br/>
Even if he wasn't satisfied with the case's outcome, he seemed to be so focused that I thought he was obsessed with it.<br/>
&gt; You listened to him talk about Naoto…<br/>
&gt; Maybe you should try talking to another police officer…<br/>
<br/>
<i>There weren't any other cops around, so I spent the rest of the afternoon helping out at the daycare. Nothing else we can do today, we'll have to try again tomorrow.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>9/17/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Well, today certainly was eventful.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00116.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Ms. Sofue:</b> Hoho… The people were very kind to me. They were probably able to sense my deep appreciation and love for their history.<br/>
I even found some things with my dowsing rod that I-Shoot, I almost forgot I'm supposed to be lecturing.<br/>
So, our next chapter is going to cover… the age of exploration.<br/>
Then let us start with a question, to see if you are all awake and ready to learn.<br/>
Hm, destiny wills me to choose… Miss Chie… No, Souji.<br/>
Magellan is known for making the first voyage around the globe, but what was his motive for doing so?<br/>
<br/>
<i>This was a pretty easy one.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00124.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Ms. Sofue:</b> …Good job, Souji. You could become a historian if you wanted to.<br/>
You're right. Magellan began his voyage to obtain a massive profit through the spice trade.<br/>
Even though he was driven by money, his greed changed the entire world's perspective.<br/>
Similar incidents can be found in Egypt as well… Let's move on with a few examples of it…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And there was another cop stationed in the shopping district today, who had the other piece of the puzzle.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00130.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You told him that Naoto hasn't been coming to school lately and that you're worried…<br/>
<b>Policeman:</b> That kid is skipping school to do his investigation…?<br/>
What's his problem, really? The department has all but closed the case. Just because he's not satisfied… Sheesh.<br/>
All we wanna do is shut the book on this thing so we don't have to deal with it anymore…<br/>
I wish he'd let it go already. No wonder the whole department treats him like a kid.<br/>
He's getting all worked up over nothing. That's why everyone gives him the cold shoulder, ya know.<br/>
&gt; You learned something about Naoto…<br/>
&gt; You should put together the information you've gathered…<br/>
&gt; It seems that Naoto had a fervid obsession with the investigation.<br/>
&gt; But it seems that his obsession was not well received, and the police treated him like a child.<br/>
&gt; You think you understand Naoto a bit more…<br/>
&gt; You should report to Rise.<br/>
<br/>
<i>And so we returned to the TV world to try and find Naoto. And just as every other time, we had plenty of surprises in store for us….</i><br/>
