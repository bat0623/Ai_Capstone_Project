			<b>6/14/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>Another crappy rainy day.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Guy With A Backpack:</b> The school camp starts next weekend, doesn't it?<br/>
<b>Lazy Student:</b> Ah, right…<br/>
It's gonna be all work. I'm not gonna have any fun at all.<br/>
Ah, there has to be some way I can ditch this stupid camp!<br/>
Alright, let's get together and brainstorm ideas on how to get out of this!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I went to drama again since the weather was so terrible. Yumi was missing again, so I headed out to the hospital to see if she was there.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Yumi is standing at the door…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yumi.png"/> Souji-kun…<br/>
…I just came from Dad's-that man's room…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'd remembered her mom wasn't doing well either.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yumi.png"/> It was nothing. She's already out of the hospital…<br/>
&gt; Yumi smiles, relieved.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yumi.png"/> I was here anyway… I came here to pick up some medicine for Mom. I just decided to stop by.<br/>
He looked at me, and he smiled like he was so happy…<br/>
"Do you want to watch TV?" "If you want to read some manga, go ahead and buy some." "Here's some money for ice cream."<br/>
……<br/>
He's so stupid…<br/>
Getting all excited… Coughing… Causing trouble for the doctors…<br/>
He's so stupid…<br/>
That man is not my father. I keep telling myself that over and over, and yet…<br/>
I can't take it anymore…<br/>
Why me… Why me, why me!?<br/>
<b>Nurse:</b> Excuse me, can you keep your voice down, please?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yumi.png"/> Oh… I'm sorry…<br/>
I'm sorry… I just lost control for a moment…<br/>
…Why do I have to go through all of this? Why me!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>This is all pretty terrible, really.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yumi.png"/> I see… Then do you think that one day, good luck will come my way…?<br/>
Or are people who have bad luck doomed to stay unlucky forever?<br/>
&gt; Yumi smiles sadly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yumi.png"/> Oh… I have to go. I need to get this medicine to my mom.<br/>
Um… I'm glad you came.<br/>
&gt; It seems you were able to give Yumi some emotional support.<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Yumi has deepened…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I hope she does manage to see some good luck soon, nobody deserves what's happening to her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yumi.png"/> …I'll see you at school.<br/>
&gt; You watched Yumi walk off sadly.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nanako watches so much TV, I decided to show her a neat trick I'd learned.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> …If you want, you can change the channel.<br/>
&gt; Nanako looks bored…<br/>
&gt; You might as well try a magic trick…<br/>
&gt; Nanako is watching curiously…<br/>
&gt; …You decide to show her a magic trick.<br/>
&gt; You put the rubber band on your index finger and middle finger…<br/>
&gt; You also hook it on the ring finger and pinky without Nanako noticing…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> What're you doing?<br/>
&gt; When you open up the hand you had closed lightly…<br/>
&gt; The rubber band springs off the index and middle finger, instantly moving over to the ring finger and pinky!<br/>
&gt; …Nanako saw part of the trick.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> I saw it! It went like, zoom!<br/>
Do it again! One more time!<br/>
&gt; She seems delighted anyway.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> Okay, my turn now!<br/>
&gt; Nanako is laughing cheerfully.<br/>
&gt; …The night continues.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm glad she enjoyed it, I'll have to come up with another one sometime.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>6/15/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Morooka continues to reinforce why he's the worst person in all of Inaba.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morooka.png"/> It's going to be a place of education to wind up the lazy ass minds you get from screwing around all the time.<br/>
You know, you all depend on other people too much! That's why you jerk-offs have all this spare time!<br/>
"Oh, he'll do it someday," or "She's doing it for me," I bet that's all you think about!<br/>
Let's take a closer look at it, shall we? What's the root of the word "pend"? Hanamura! Stop smiling and answer!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yosuke.png"/> First of all, how could I be smiling in this class…? And second, this has nothing to do with logic…<br/>
"Pend," eh? Words with "pend" in them… Uh…<br/>
I have no clue… Souji, help me out here?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Morooka is a real bastard by the way.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morooka.png"/> Ahh, pretty good, Hanamura… Or should I be praising Seta?<br/>
You're right. The root word "pend" means "to hang."<br/>
Like Hanamura was too tongue-tied to explain, words like "pendant" and "pendulum" are good examples!<br/>
Those girls who got murdered were fooling around and depending on others, and that's what got them killed!<br/>
Unless you want to end up the same, make sure you don't depend too much on others!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yosuke.png"/> …That was evil. How could he say that…?<br/>
…Thanks, Souji. He'd probably have stabbed me to death with his words if I hadn't "depended" on you…<br/>
<br/>
<i>At lunch I ran into Ai again, she felt like skipping school and after that shit with Morooka I had to agree.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00086.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Ai.png"/> Hey, you wanna ditch class? Don't worry, we'll be back before the last bell.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Souji.png"/> Sure, why not?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Ai.png"/> Really… Alright, then meet me at the shoe lockers.<br/>
&gt; You accepted Ai's invitation and decided to skip afternoon classes.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We took the train to Okina.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00091.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Ai has dragged you here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Ai.png"/> Mmmm! Feels so good.<br/>
Just knowing everyone else is still stuck at school studying makes it feel great to be out here.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Again after that Morooka shit I'm down with skipping.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00095.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Ai.png"/> You think so? I'm surprised you're so open-minded.<br/>
I had you pegged for a mama's boy.<br/>
It's not like I do this all the time.<br/>
Besides, since they started keeping track of my attendance and behavior record, I've been a good girl.<br/>
Well, enough small talk. Let's go.<br/>
We'll start with clothes, then we'll hit jewelry and shoes, and maybe some cell phone stuff if there's enough time.<br/>
&gt; Ai only seems to be concerned about her own shopping…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still beats school.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00103.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Ai.png"/> Of course you will. Why else would you be here?<br/>
Anyway, time's a'wasting.<br/>
It's nice to have a personal servant! I can buy so much more this way.<br/>
&gt; Ai paid for everything with a gold card…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It seems Ai is loaded.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00108.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Ai.png"/> Well, I guess you could call my family "new money."<br/>
We may not have status or history, but we do have money. My daddy made a fortune in land speculation.<br/>
We'd better get going, though, or we won't make it back before class ends.<br/>
Soon as school gets out, I'm number one on the guidance counselor's list.<br/>
He has to check on my attendance and behavior, and sometimes, he tops it off with a lecture. It's a major pain.<br/>
But I'm out here having fun, and all the teachers are totally clueless. How stupid can they be?<br/>
You know what, though? I had more fun today than usual.<br/>
You're different from the others. I like you.<br/>
I think I'll keep you around. But next time, let's go after school.<br/>
&gt; You have become acquaintances with the sports team manager, Ai Ebihara.<br/>
&gt; You feel a faint bond forming between you and Ai…<br/>
<br/>
<i>So far Ai seems like pretty much the only normal person I've got one of these with and there's something to be said for that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00120.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Ai.png"/> Are you coming!? Or maybe you'd like to be a blip on the guidance counselor's radar yourself?<br/>
&gt; You returned to school with Ai and snuck into your class…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided to check up on that kid I gave the sticker.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00195.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Lonely Boy:</b> Y'know the sticker you gave me? Everyone already knew about it…<br/>
But I did make friends!<br/>
I talked to them every time I got a new sticker, and they just kinda became my friends!<br/>
It's thanks to you! Oh, and also the fox.<br/>
I wrote my wish at the shrine. They said a fox grants wishes there.<br/>
I'll go say thanks to the fox later!<br/>
&gt; You accomplished the request written on the ema!<br/>
&gt; You should report back to the fox…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I went to soccer practice, but Daisuke had a thing to do after and had to run.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00129.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Souji.png"/> If you say so.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Daisuke.png"/> Ah… Perfect timing.<br/>
Later.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Kou.png"/> Hm? What's up with the cold shoulder? Daisuke can be such a damn rebel.<br/>
Oh well, I guess that makes it easier. I need to talk to you.<br/>
Tell you what, we'll talk over map rice. My treat!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Again never say no to free stuff.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00136.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Kou.png"/> Great! Heck, I'll get you a large!<br/>
&gt; Kou looks happy…<br/>
&gt; You left school to listen to what Kou has to say.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I wondered what we needed to straight leave the grounds to talk about.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Kou.png"/> You probably guessed this, but it's about Daisuke.<br/>
&gt; Kou speaks with a serious expression…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Kou.png"/> You've noticed him slacking off at practice a lot lately, right?<br/>
He never used to do that kind of stuff…<br/>
Before, he woulda died for any chance to play soccer.<br/>
You practically had to pry the ball away from him, even off the field.<br/>
But now he's half-assing everything…<br/>
I don't get it. Maybe he just doesn't think playing hard is "cool" anymore…<br/>
He took it seriously when he was helping you train, though, right?<br/>
He really wanted you to get good enough for the team to accept you…<br/>
Don't get me wrong, I don't think he was faking it or anything…<br/>
But… I wonder if part of that was him trying to make you do the things he feels like he can't anymore…<br/>
…He's fooling himself.<br/>
It just pisses me off to watch him do this…<br/>
&gt; Kou sighs…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kou was pretty worried.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00157.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Kou.png"/> Ya know, his new attitude toward girls is pretty sudden, too.<br/>
He used to talk about girls like any normal guy would.<br/>
You think it could be related…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Seemed as good a theory as any.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00161.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Kou.png"/> You think so too?<br/>
&gt; Kou nods…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Kou.png"/> He can be a little blunt sometimes, but he's a nice guy.<br/>
He's been acting so cold toward girls, though, like he's saying stuff that he doesn't really mean…<br/>
……<br/>
I'm only telling you this because I trust you, but…<br/>
……<br/>
&gt; Kou begins to speak slowly…<br/>
See, Daisuke had a girlfriend back in middle school…<br/>
But from what he told me, they never even held hands.<br/>
Then she broke up with him.<br/>
She made a big scene. She was all like, "You don't even like me, do you!?" I heard she even slapped him.<br/>
And ever since then, he's been saying stuff like, "I don't know what it means to like someone…"<br/>
At the rate he's going, he's gonna die an old hermit.<br/>
&gt; Kou sighs…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Kou.png"/> What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Daisuke's my friend, if there's some way I can help him I've gotta do it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00178.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Kou.png"/> Yeah, I think so too.<br/>
&gt; Kou nods.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Kou.png"/> Whoa!<br/>
I just had a great idea. I'm a genius…<br/>
You're with me on this, right? You're gonna help him?<br/>
&gt; Kou is looking at you expectantly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Souji.png"/> Count me in.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Kou.png"/> Alright! Now we're talking!<br/>
&gt; Kou is ecstatic…<br/>
&gt; By worrying about Daisuke with Kou, you feel your bonds strengthen.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I wonder what his plan is though…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00189.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Kou.png"/> I'll set everything up. Make sure you wear some clean boxers!<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You passed the time with a rather vulgar conversation…<br/>
<br/>
<i>The campout's almost here, I just hope it's not as bad as Chie and Yukiko are saying it'll be.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>6/16/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>So we decided to head to Junes to get some food for the campout.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Yukiko.png"/> School camp starts tomorrow.<br/>
We'll be in the same group, but what should we be cooking for dinner?<br/>
Hey, why don't we get everyone and go buy ingredients after school?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Souji.png"/> We should do that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Yukiko.png"/> Okay.<br/>
I'll be sure to let Chie and Yosuke-kun know, then.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke said he had a thing to do on a different floor when we got to Junes. Yukiko and Chie were insisting on cooking so I left it to them.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00215.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Yukiko.png"/> Carrots, potatoes, onions… mushrooms, green peppers, and… radishes?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Chie.png"/> Are radishes… the same as turnips?<br/>
&gt; They're apparently going to make curry.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Chie.png"/> Curry's fine, right? It's practically our national food.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Yukiko.png"/> We were going back and forth between ramen and curry, but I thought ramen might not be enough for you guys.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Chie.png"/> Hmm, I wonder what kind of ingredients Yosuke likes… I get the feeling he's real picky.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Yukiko.png"/> He's on another floor, isn't he? Do you want me to go ask?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Chie.png"/> Nah, no need. Plus, he said he needed to get ready for something.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Yukiko.png"/> ……<br/>
Hey, Chie. You use potato starch for curry, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Chie.png"/> ……? O-Of course you do.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Yukiko.png"/> Otherwise, the sauce wouldn't thicken.<br/>
Then, we need potato starch and… some flour, too?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Chie.png"/> Th, there are different kinds of flour… Which should we get? All-purpose? Whole wheat?<br/>
<br/>
<i>You know I'd been hoping maybe Chie knew what she was doing because I already know Yukiko does not. That did not seem to be the case.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-P4-00231.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Yukiko.png"/> Let's get that one. And… here they are!<br/>
Chili peppers! It's not curry if it isn't spicy.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Chie.png"/> Oh well… Let's just get everything that seems right.<br/>
How about some kimchi, too? And some ground pepper!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Yukiko.png"/> There's two kinds, though. Black and white.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Chie.png"/> Whoa! Way to go, Yukiko… The Amagi family sure knows their stuff! Let's get both, just in case.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Yukiko.png"/> Oh yeah… We'll need some special ingredients, too, to spice things up.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Chie.png"/> Hmm, I remember seeing something on TV about that… I think it was… chocolate… coffee… yogurt…<br/>
How about mint chocolate!? I love that stuff!<br/>
I don't like coffee that much, though… Oh, I can drink mocha, so let's get that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Yukiko.png"/> What about some seafood? That should make the sauce taste better.<br/>
<br/>
<i>So we're all going to die. I went to work at the hospital again, since I'm sure getting in with them is going to be important after I eat whatever they're going to make.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-P4-00249.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Sayoko.png"/> Oh, you sweet thing. Well, then…<br/>
Would you like to study with me? Perhaps a subject they don't teach in school, if you catch my drift…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Seriously what is the deal with this nurse?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-P4-00254.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Sayoko.png"/> Oho… You're an honest guy. That's cute, in boys your age.<br/>
&gt; Sayoko smirks at you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Sayoko.png"/> I don't find your type around here.<br/>
The kids over here are much simpler. All they see is the carrot dangling in front of their faces…<br/>
You're… I know. You seem to have some sort of secret deep inside you…<br/>
…I think it's irresistible.<br/>
&gt; Sayoko smiles in satisfaction.<br/>
&gt; You can feel Sayoko's mischievous affection for you…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-P4-00263.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Sayoko.png"/> I'll see you again.<br/>
<br/>
<i>The campout is tomorrow. I just hope things aren't so bad as I'm worrying.</i><br/>
