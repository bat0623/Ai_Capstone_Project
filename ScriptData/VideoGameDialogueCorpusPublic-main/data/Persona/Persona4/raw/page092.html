<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> I'm a consultant with the police.<br/>
I'd like a few words with Namatame-san. May I go in?<br/>
<b>Policeman:</b> This is unit 252 requesting confirmation on an ID…<br/>
Name of Naoto Shirogane… Huh?<br/>
Ah, understood. I see.<br/>
Well, you're on the list…<br/>
I can give you a few minutes, but I'll have to record your conversation with him for security purposes.<br/>
Not that I expect you'll get anything coherent out of the guy. He's been spouting nothing but gibberish.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> I'd like him to accompany me as well.<br/>
He has no identification, but this is an emergency situation and he's here in Detective Dojima's stead.<br/>
<b>Policeman:</b> Huh…? Detective Dojima sent him? I wasn't informed of this…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> I'll vouch for his identity.<br/>
<b>Policeman:</b> Well, I guess it's better than dealing with the man himself…<br/>
We have our hands full with the transport procedures, so the last thing we need is Detective Dojima running wild…<br/>
Detective Adachi is busy somewhere too…<br/>
<br/>
<i>That was when Naoto's plan went into action. Have I said I love her recently? Because damn is she good at this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Has something happened?<br/>
<b>Policeman:</b> Something about a suspicious object out in the lobby…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Ah. Well then, this works out nicely.<br/>
You should back up your colleagues downstairs. We'll keep watch over Namatame-san.<br/>
A disturbance in a hospital lobby, after all… It sounds serious.<br/>
<b>Policeman:</b> If anything happens, hit the nurse call button. I'll leave the rest to you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Understood. Please be careful.<br/>
I knew they were undermanned, but I didn't expect it to go this smoothly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Wow…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> There's nothing much inside that "suspicious object."<br/>
So he won't be gone long.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> Alright, then now's our chance to talk to Namatame!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We all piled into Namatame's room, but this time just to talk.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> It's tempting to think that you were the culprit behind this entire case.<br/>
And to be honest… there are many in this town who hope you are.<br/>
But we are here to learn the truth. So please… answer our questions.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> ……<br/>
&gt; It seems that he understands what you're saying.<br/>
&gt; What should you ask him…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>We started with something easy and definitive.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yukiko.png"/> Huh…? Me?<br/>
……<br/>
<br/>
<i>That really said it all as far as him being the culprit, but we had a lot more to ask.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> They were killed…<br/>
I couldn't save them…<br/>
<br/>
<i>That led right into the next thing we had to clear up.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> No… If nobody saves them, they'll be killed…<br/>
That's why… I put them in there…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Then tell me if my estimation is correct so far.<br/>
After discovering the Yamano and Konishi incidents, you realized an appearance on the Midnight Channel meant certain death.<br/>
Thus, to "save" her from that fate, you kidnapped Yukiko Amagi…<br/>
You couldn't let her be killed, so you threw her into the TV, preventing the killer in this world from reaching her…<br/>
And you repeated the process, as more individuals appeared on the Midnight Channel…<br/>
It all falls into place.<br/>
His body is weak, but his mind is sound. He's trying to tell us the truth…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, but if the stuff he's saying is true…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Rise.png"/> There's another killer who murdered the first two victims…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Indulge us in a few more questions.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I hoped Namatame might have figured out something we hadn't, but no luck.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> I have no idea… I wanna know that too…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We'd already figured that he hadn't sent the letters, but I wanted to double-check.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> What are you talking about…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Each question just further proved he wasn't the original killer.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> I didn't know…<br/>
I never thought… it would be that kind of place…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> …As I thought.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> You… believe me…?<br/>
D-Did they find him!? Did they find the one who did such cruel things!?<br/>
M-Mayumi…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Please calm down. Our ability to find the culprit rests on you.<br/>
We know about the other world.<br/>
In fact, we're the only ones who can fully understand what you have to say.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> Only… you…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> We did blame you for everything at first.<br/>
But now, I think we can accept whatever you got to tell us… as truth.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> Please…<br/>
Tell us everything you can… Calmly and slowly.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> You're willing to listen… to my story…?<br/>
……<br/>
All right…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Namatame told us how it all started, from his perspective.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00081.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Reminiscing Namatame :</b> I returned to my parent's home, as if to run away from the scandal…<br/>
And I started drinking heavily to drown my anxieties…<br/>
I hadn't been able to reach Mayumi at all, and that didn't help, either…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> Mayumi… Where are you…?<br/>
<b>Reminiscing Namatame :</b> She'd been disgraced on all the afternoon shows and forced to resign from the program she was on.<br/>
I caused her so much trouble… I wanted to at least apologize to her, but I couldn't even do that…<br/>
I lost the will and energy to do anything…<br/>
Then one day, the rumor I heard some time ago came back to me.<br/>
Since I had nothing better to do, I sat down blankly in front of the TV and watched my own reflection…<br/>
And all of a sudden, there was Mayumi.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> Mayumi…? Is that you?<br/>
<b>Reminiscing Namatame :</b> The Mayumi inside the TV looked as if she was calling to me for help…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> Mayumi… Mayumi!<br/>
<br/>
<i>The next part was where I really snapped to attention.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00095.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Reminiscing Namatame :</b> My arm disappeared into the TV… as if I had dipped it into a pool of water.<br/>
I was so shocked that I lost my balance and nearly fell face-first into the TV.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> I was so scared… I couldn't understand what just happened. I thought maybe I'd gone insane.<br/>
In the end, I decided to think of it as just a dream, and I went back to the city the next day after finishing work.<br/>
The next afternoon, when I got to work… I was fired on the spot, as I expected.<br/>
That wasn't what broke me, though…<br/>
It was Mayumi being found dead.<br/>
And not just that, but it had happened in my hometown.<br/>
&gt; Namatame is casting his eyes downward painfully…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> I was dumbstruck, but later on… I remembered the image of Mayumi I'd seen that night.<br/>
"Was it not a dream…? Could it really have been an SOS from Mayumi…?"<br/>
I hadn't touched another TV, because the first time was so terrifying, but I decided to try it again…<br/>
And I confirmed that none of it was a dream.<br/>
So that image… Was it something Mayumi showed me, calling for help…?<br/>
…That's how I felt.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> And eventually… you learned of the Midnight Channel.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm amazed at how widespread that rumor was even then.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00113.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> I'd heard about it before, but I thought it was just an urban legend.<br/>
But then Mayumi appeared on it, and later turned up dead.<br/>
The more I thought about it, the harder it became to believe that the two events were unrelated.<br/>
Soon after that, I came back to Inaba to answer the police's questions.<br/>
I'd lost my job, and I wanted to know the truth of Mayumi's death for myself.<br/>
Then, on another rainy night, someone else appeared on the Midnight Channel… It was a girl.<br/>
She looked like she was calling for help, just like Mayumi.<br/>
The first thing that came into my mind was, "Maybe this girl will be the next to die…"<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> And that was Saki-senpai…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> I'd been following all the news about Mayumi, so I noticed right away that she was the girl who found Mayumi's body.<br/>
And if my hunch was right, she'd be the next victim. I didn't want her to die the way Mayumi did…<br/>
So I desperately kept watching… I was consumed with the idea of rescuing her.<br/>
Then… little by little, her image on the screen came into sharper focus.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> It became sharper…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> ……<br/>
How did you find out it was her?<br/>
<br/>
<i>That was a pretty easy one.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00130.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> I met that girl when I delivered a package to the liquor store…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And now we knew why people thought he'd been hitting on Saki.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00132.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Reminiscing Namatame :</b> But that same night, on the TV…<br/>
She looked as if she was being engulfed by some black shape… She was writhing in pain…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> That's why I warned her…! Why won't she pick up the phone!?<br/>
Come on! Please…!<br/>
The next day, they found her dead.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> I knew she was gonna be murdered, but I couldn't save her.<br/>
I blamed myself, thinking there must have been something I could've done…<br/>
There was no one who depended on me. Nobody at work… Not even my wife.<br/>
Mayumi was the only one who accepted me for who I was.<br/>
But she was murdered, and the same person killed another girl…<br/>
I was… I was beside myself… I couldn't forgive myself for doing nothing!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> You really did love Ms. Yamano…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> Yes, from the bottom of my heart…<br/>
Before I was married, my wife made it big in show business. I was happy for her, but it put a strain on our relationship.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Rise.png"/> …I think I can kinda relate.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> It was around that time when I met Mayumi… She was interviewing our candidate for the next election.<br/>
She was a big-name announcer, but she only worked with local stations, and her attitude towards work was similar to mine.<br/>
We both came from Inaba, so she was easy to talk to… I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't help getting intimate with her.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Poor Namatame…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00152.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> Soon after Saki-san was found dead, yet another girl appeared on TV…<br/>
…That was you.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It all started to fall into place.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00155.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> I can't let her end up like Mayumi and that other girl… This time, I'm gonna do something…<br/>
<b>Reminiscing Namatame :</b> My opponent was a murderer who left no clues to his identity…<br/>
I thought hard about what I could do to protect her from someone like that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> I'll never convince her… If she gets suspicious and they arrest me, who'll save her then…?<br/>
<b>Reminiscing Namatame :</b> The girl inside the TV looked as if she was smiling at me…<br/>
And… that's when it hit me.<br/>
I apparently had the power to go through the TV screen to the other side…<br/>
Then, what if I put her into the TV and give her shelter there before the killer gets her…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> What are you trying to tell me!? That it's safe over there? Is that it!?<br/>
<b>Reminiscing Namatame :</b> The girl inside the TV seemed to smile at me again…<br/>
And I thought, no matter what kind of place it might be, it's better than being slaughtered.<br/>
Once things calmed down, I could just let her out again…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> If she's inside the TV… There's no way they can find her…<br/>
<b>Reminiscing Namatame :</b> It felt as if everything was starting to come together in my mind…<br/>
Could it be… that Mayumi gave me that power, to prevent any more victims from meeting her fate…?<br/>
Was it my mission to save people?<br/>
But there was a big problem…<br/>
If I explained the situation to the victim, they wouldn't understand. I had already tried that and failed miserably.<br/>
It seemed the only thing I could do was take them away. If that was my mission… I'd just have to do it.<br/>
…Or so I thought.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> Mayumi… Please lend me your strength…<br/>
<br/>
<i>He never could have realized he was putting them in danger.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00177.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Mission!? Give me a break! You never stopped and wondered about any of this!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> I thought I was the only one who could help them… I did call the police, but they didn't believe me.<br/>
I knew the area well, thanks to my job. I had a large truck, and I could move around without suspicion…<br/>
I thought my job as a deliveryman would be the perfect cover for my mission. I thought no one else could do it…<br/>
But… are you telling me that I wasn't saving them…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> If a person is still within the TV world when the fog appears here, they will die.<br/>
Beginning with Yukiko-san, the people you thought you had been saving were, in fact, in mortal peril…<br/>
It was my friends here who really saved us all.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> I had a feeling that was it…<br/>
When I went after that little girl and entered the TV myself… For the first time, I had some doubts about myself.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> You refer to Nanako-chan, correct?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> The police were after me, so I had to get away.<br/>
But I still felt I needed to do everything I could to save that poor little girl…<br/>
That's why I went in after her.<br/>
But the TV world was completely different than I imagined… Such an abominable, grotesque place.<br/>
I knew that the three of you who I "saved" went back to your normal lives, so I didn't realize how terrible that world was.<br/>
I never knew… you couldn't even get out of that place on your own…<br/>
I thought I was going insane-I probably did.<br/>
And you know the rest. When I came to, I was lying in a hospital bed.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Good intentions can still lead to bad results. We need to be careful about that as well.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00197.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> But I ended up doing just the opposite… What a fool.<br/>
I always wanted to enter the world of politics, and become useful to society…<br/>
But after losing my job and the woman I loved… all I had left was this power.<br/>
I convinced myself that world was some sort of sanctuary… And I secretly believed myself to be a hero…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> I never doubted what I saw on TV… and believed everything was as I wanted it to be…<br/>
I didn't think for myself at all… That's why I couldn't protect them.<br/>
I'm to blame for all of this…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm still pissed at what he did to Nanako, but blaming him won't change it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00206.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> I suppose so… But the things I've done are too serious to be brushed aside like that…<br/>
I have no intentions of running away from my crimes. I'm prepared to face the consequences.<br/>
Kidnapping is already a serious crime… And on top of that, I put all those lives in danger.<br/>
I'm sorry…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> The Midnight Channel and the other world… You can hardly be blamed for failing to understand them properly.<br/>
We must apologize to you as well.<br/>
Had we let our emotions blind us to the truth, we would have piled all the responsibility on you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> I guess from your point of view… people did stop dying once you started "saving" people.<br/>
The more you did it, the more you really believed you were preventing their deaths…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> I'm… such a joke…<br/>
I'm sorry… I'm getting a little tired…<br/>
<br/>
<i>That was when the cop returned.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00218.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> My apologies. We'll be leaving now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Namatame.png"/> Wait…<br/>
I beg you… Please find whoever's behind this… You children are the only ones who know about that world…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Souji.png"/> That's our plan.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> It's all clear now. He never committed any murders…<br/>
It was another party who threw the first two victims into the TV.<br/>
&gt; You've taken another step toward the truth…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Of course that just leads to more questions.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00226.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Policeman:</b> Now get out of here!<br/>
I told you, he's almost ready to be transported! We can't have anything else happen…<br/>
Sheesh… I better not see you rascals here again!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed down to see how Nanako was doing and talk things over.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00230.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> This was the last place we saw Teddie, right? He was so worried about her…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Kanji.png"/> Tch… How can he flake out like this when we have to find the real killer?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Naoto.png"/> The police consider the matter closed. We'll have to do all the investigation from here on out.<br/>
Let's revisit Saki-san and Ms. Yamano's incidents and see if we can turn up fresh details.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> But it's been over six months… Wouldn't the trail be cold by now?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> I know, but we can't give up. We're the only ones who understand what's really going on.<br/>
And you never know. People might remember some things now because they've had so much time to think about it.<br/>
Let's split up and talk to people all over town tomorrow.<br/>
We'll meet up in the evening to discuss our findings.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yukiko.png"/> I hope we can find out something about Teddie, too…<br/>
&gt; Tomorrow, you'll all be going out to talk to people in town.<br/>
&gt; Will this finally help uncover the information that will lead you to the true culprit…?<br/>
&gt; You decide to go home early today and get some rest.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I just hope we can find something, this guy's been on the loose for far too long.</i><br/>
