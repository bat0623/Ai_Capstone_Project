<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Given the pattern so far, Kanji's already inside the TV...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> I wonder what the Midnight Channel really is...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hmm...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> At first, I thought it was one of those "paranormal" things, but when I gave it a try... it was real.<br/>
Turns out it's actually connected to another world...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> If there's a rumor going around, that means a bunch of people are watching it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> How did the rumor go...? If you stare into a turned-off TV on a rainy night...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> No one in their right mind would try something that ridiculous, don'tcha think? Unless someone urged them to.<br/>
But if you actually try, it does work. And not just once.<br/>
If this rumor spreads and everyone starts watching the Midnight Channel...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> It could cause a huge panic...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> If Teddie is right, the missing people themselves create the stuff we see.<br/>
So it's not random. It's specifically related to whoever goes missing.<br/>
<br/>
<i>There's a lot of this that doesn't really make much sense at this point.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Um, this might be a little off subject, but...<br/>
The culprit is probably watching the shows that come on... right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> No doubt. He's probably sitting back and enjoying--<br/>
Wait a sec... I bet he IS enjoying it!<br/>
He's probably laughing his head off watching the "show" that comes on after he throws people into the TV!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Ahhh, I get it. Yeah, it's definitely possible.<br/>
Ugh... Now when I think of the killer, I get this image of a total sicko!<br/>
"I wanna see everything about you, Yuki-chan!"<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Urgh, ugh, ugh!<br/>
Wait, so if people saw Yukiko's show, do you think people were watching what happened to me too!?<br/>
Oh, that is IT! That killer is dead meat! I'm gonna leave footprints all over his face!<br/>
Guys!<br/>
First we save Kanji! Then, we crush the killer!<br/>
Finally, we crush the killer and send him to hell!! Got it!?<br/>
&gt; You've all strengthened your resolve to save Kanji...<br/>
<br/>
<i>We'd become stronger as a team, and I could feel it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Heehee...<br/>
Ch-Chie, those last two were the same thing...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Uh... I know...<br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed into the TV, but it turned out things weren't going to be so easy.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Teddie.png"/> Oh... Yep. I think someone's here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> You think...? Do you know where he is?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Teddie.png"/> I dunno.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> We think it's a boy named Kanji...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Teddie.png"/> I dunno...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> What's wrong? Not feeling well?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Teddie.png"/> Well, I sniff and I sniff. But I still can't tell where the smell comes from.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Aren't you thinking too much about too many things?<br/>
I mean last time, you were wondering about who you really are and how long you've been here.<br/>
Your head's empty to begin with, dude. Don't stress out over stuff too much.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Teddie.png"/> You're right...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Whoa... He's seriously down about this...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> If you can't figure out where Kanji is, we're in deep trouble.<br/>
We can't just wander around aimlessly in a place like this...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Teddie.png"/> I know what might help! You should give me a clue about this Kanji person!<br/>
It's just a feeling I have. I think I could concentrate better with it.<br/>
Do you have anything that could give me a good understanding of him?<br/>
<br/>
<i>We didn't really know much about him is the problem.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chie.png"/> Yeah, it's not like we know him that well.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Teddie.png"/> I just need some sort of hint... Something that tells me what he's really like.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yukiko.png"/> Why don't we ask around and find people who know Kanji-kun personally?<br/>
&gt; Teddie may be able to grasp Kanji's location if he gets more information about Kanji.<br/>
&gt; But what kind of information does he need...?<br/>
&gt; You decide to ask around town about Kanji...<br/>
<br/>
<i>The logical place to start was with his mother. Since it was on the way I stopped by the fox, seemed it had a new wish for me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It's written in thin, lady-like handwriting...<br/>
<b>Ema:</b> I want to clear my mind of snacks. I want to hate them.<br/>
&gt; It seems the fox wants you to fulfill the wish written on the ema on its behalf.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's funny because while I was asking around about Kanji I ran into the person who made the wish.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Slim Woman:</b> I'm channeling my mental energy in order to control my urges...<br/>
I mustn't want snacks... They'll just make me faaaat... Shiroku Store is my enemy...<br/>
Remember all that dieting and exercise... Do you wanna have to do all that again?<br/>
Must shun the snacks...<br/>
Ahhh! Snacks... I want to eat snacks!<br/>
*sigh* I wonder if there're any bad-tasting snacks.<br/>
Actually, it doesn't have to be bad... Maybe if it were just odd-tasting, I would stop thinking about them...?<br/>
I want to distance myself from those Shiroku snacks...<br/>
&gt; Perhaps she's the one who wrote the ema request the fox showed you.<br/>
&gt; It seems she is looking for a snack that isn't like the snacks that she's currently craving.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'll need to keep an eye out for some sort of strange snack. Anyway, I talked to Kanji's mom.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Textile Shop Owner:</b> Sheesh, I wonder where he's wandered off to now. He's always like this.<br/>
You know, there was a small boy who came asking about him not too long ago.<br/>
I talked to him too, but I haven't seen him around lately.<br/>
&gt; A boy who talked to Kanji... Could it be the small boy from before?<br/>
&gt; ......<br/>
&gt; If it was him, and he was with Kanji, he might know something.<br/>
&gt; You decide to search for the boy...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Some of the people in the shopping district had seen him around Junes, so I headed down that way.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00108.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Customer:</b> Ah yes, I've seen him. He's been hanging around here lately. Even asked me all this stuff about that... incident.<br/>
He was just over there a little while ago, but... Maybe he'll be back tomorrow...?<br/>
&gt; You decide to return here tomorrow...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Wasn't much I could do, so I headed back to school and played some soccer. When I got home, Nanako wanted to talk to me a bit.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00122.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Nanako.png"/> Big bro...<br/>
&gt; Nanako is fidgeting.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It seemed like she wanted to ask me something.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00125.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Nanako.png"/> Okay! Ummm... well...<br/>
&gt; Nanako looks relieved.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Nanako.png"/> Are you an only child?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00129.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Nanako.png"/> So you're just like me.<br/>
Oh, but I have you now, so...<br/>
&gt; Nanako is smiling cheerfully...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Nanako.png"/> A while ago, Dad told me...<br/>
That our family won't get any bigger...<br/>
But now I have a big brother!<br/>
&gt; Nanako beams at you with a smile that covers her entire face...<br/>
&gt; Through that smile, you feel your relationship has grown deeper...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Poor Nanako, I can't imagine what things were like before I got here.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00138.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Nanako.png"/> Let's talk, big bro!<br/>
Umm... I wanna hear about your school!<br/>
&gt; Nanako has begged you to talk to her...<br/>
&gt; You decided to talk about various things.<br/>
&gt; It has gotten late, so you put Nanako to bed and went to your room.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Hopefully we'll manage to find that kid tomorrow.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>5/19/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke had checked the weather before school, and had some good news.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00144.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> According to the weather report, we won't have to worry about the fog for a while.<br/>
Let's keep cool, like usual. We can save the day and still keep our skills sharp!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Souji.png"/> That's a good plan.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, it's not going to do anyone any good if we get anxious.<br/>
Let's be sure to use the time we have until the next foggy day to our advantage so we can save him for sure!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh, exam grades were up earlier. I'm pretty happy with the result all told.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00150.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> They posted the test results!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Argh... The awful moment of truth...<br/>
Oh well. Wanna check it out?<br/>
&gt; You decided to check the test results.<br/>
<br/>
<i>At least I've managed to keep things together school wise.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00155.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Wow, nice! Good going, Souji!<br/>
You're so smart...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh and that dude who was asking about the girl on the roof was around today.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00162.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You tell him what you talked about with the girl on the rooftop.<br/>
<b>Male Student:</b> I see, so that's how it is...<br/>
...I see.<br/>
Ah, sorry! You really helped me out, though! Here, take this.<br/>
&gt; Received Goho-M.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sure enough I had luck at Junes.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00174.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> Many people from the town come and meet here. It's a very convenient location, isn't it...?<br/>
&gt; Wasn't this the boy who met with Kanji some time ago...?<br/>
&gt; He may know something about Kanji...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Naoto.png"/> ......?<br/>
You're asking if anything seemed strange when I spoke to Kanji-kun, yes...?<br/>
Hmm. Very well.<br/>
It seems to be an urgent matter, so I'll simply tell you.<br/>
If you're asking about recent events, then yes, there was something out of the ordinary.<br/>
It was something I felt when I was with him... So I told him outright that he seemed to be an odd person.<br/>
After I said that, his expression changed all of a sudden... I was quite surprised.<br/>
On that basis, I believe his actions were somewhat forced and unnatural, throughout the time I was with him.<br/>
He may have some sort of complex... Though I have no proof of this.<br/>
&gt; It seems Kanji has a complex or something of that nature...<br/>
&gt; Kanji's purported reaction to the phrase "odd person"...<br/>
&gt; Maybe this is enough of a clue for Teddie to go on...<br/>
&gt; You should report to Teddie as soon as possible.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was too late to head into the TV today, so I headed back and caught the start of drama practice. It certainly was... dramatic.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00191.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yumi.png"/> I'm going to have the lead role this year!<br/>
Can you help me with my part later?<br/>
<b>Non-Drama Club Member:</b> Yumi! Your mother collapsed!<br/>
There was a call from the hospital!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yumi.png"/> Huh...? Oh, er... What should I do...? We're still...<br/>
<br/>
<i>I offered to come with her if she needed help with anything.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00197.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yumi.png"/> Huh!? Oh, no, it's okay...<br/>
I-I'm going!<br/>
&gt; Yumi ran out of the room.<br/>
<b>Drama Club Member:</b> The hospital? I wonder what happened...<br/>
I think we're all too worried to get any more practice in... Let's call it a day!<br/>
&gt; Did Yumi go to the hospital...?<br/>
&gt; ...You decided to go see.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I didn't have much trouble finding them.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00206.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yumi.png"/> What is HE doing here!? Why are you here with him!?<br/>
You didn't collapse! You lied to me!<br/>
I can't believe this! Tell me what's going on!<br/>
<b>Yumi's Mother:</b> ...Yumi.<br/>
He's the one who collapsed, not me. But I knew you wouldn't come if I told you that.<br/>
So, yes, I did lie to you. I wanted you to see him.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yumi.png"/> Mom... Do you think I want anything to do with that man!?<br/>
<b>Yumi's Mother:</b> No.<br/>
I know you've suffered a lot. I feel responsible for what happened, too.<br/>
But, you see... It was his last request.<br/>
...He doesn't have much longer. That's why he wanted to see you...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yumi.png"/> S-So what? I don't care if he lives or dies!<br/>
He's a complete stranger! He's not my father!<br/>
Mom, you and I... He abandoned us both!<br/>
And now what? Now that he's on his deathbed, he expects us to forgive him?<br/>
Don't give me that crap!<br/>
<b>Yumi's Mother:</b> ...I've made up my mind. I'm going to stay by his side until he passes away.<br/>
Letting him die all alone would be too cruel to think of...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00225.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Yumi's Mother:</b> Yumi... I'm sorry. But it's what I want to do.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yumi.png"/> Th-Then go ahead! It's not my problem!<br/>
How can you...!? We've been abandoned, for crying out loud...!<br/>
Wh-When did you get here!? Were you listening to me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>What was I supposed to say?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00230.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yumi.png"/> You... Eavesdropping on people's private conversations! You're a real sicko...!<br/>
&gt; Yumi seems at a loss.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yumi.png"/> ......<br/>
Mom didn't collapse...<br/>
When I got to the hospital, it turned out that the person in bed is the man who used to be my father...<br/>
......<br/>
He abandoned my mother and me... about ten years ago.<br/>
He found another woman... He's a dirty sleazebag.<br/>
And now he comes crawling back to his "daughter" because he's dying? Yeah, after getting dumped by his bimbo...<br/>
Talk about shameless...<br/>
*sigh* This sucks so much... I'd forgotten him after all this time...<br/>
His name, his face, his very existence. I completely blocked him out!<br/>
Even worse, Mom's going to look after him until he kicks the bucket. She's being stupid. How gullible can you get!?<br/>
HE left HER, understand? Now he's a hand-me-down from the other woman who dumped him when he got sick.<br/>
They're both pathetic...!<br/>
&gt; Yumi is trembling with anger...<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean seriously I had to say something but what the hell was actually going to mean anything?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00247.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yumi.png"/> Shut up! What do you know about me...!?<br/>
&gt; Yumi hangs her head.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yumi.png"/> I'm sorry...<br/>
...I'm sorry. I've calmed down.<br/>
......<br/>
What are you even doing here?<br/>
All this... It must be hilarious to watch, huh...?<br/>
&gt; In some small way, you were able to help comfort Yumi.<br/>
&gt; You feel that your relationship with Yumi has deepened slightly...<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't get any of this at all but I helped her out I guess.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00257.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Yumi.png"/> I'm going home. Let's walk together...<br/>
&gt; You walked home with Yumi. She seemed to be filled with gloom.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We're going back into the TV tomorrow. Hopefully Teddie will be able to lead us to Kanji.</i><br/>
<br/>
