			<b>10/31/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>We had the day off today, I was down by the river and decided to drop in on Hisano, even though she'd told me not to.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hisano.png"/> Haha… I'm no good.<br/>
I said I didn't want to see you, and yet part of me was hoping that you would come anyway…<br/>
I'm happy that you did…<br/>
If it's all right with you, shall we talk?<br/>
I'd be happy to.<br/>
&gt; Hisano smiles gently…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hisano.png"/> I was half expecting you to come, and half thinking that you'd given up.<br/>
Being noncommittal… floating around, never deciding to be one thing nor another. Can a man understand that?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I certainly do get what she's talking about, because I was doing it up until yesterday.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hisano.png"/> I see… I suppose this kind of feeling isn't gender-specific.<br/>
&gt; Hisano smiles cheerfully.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hisano.png"/> I just remembered something…<br/>
Before we were married, you remember that my husband and I could only meet once a year, yes?<br/>
So we exchanged letters, all the time.<br/>
I'd wait by the mailbox every day, wondering when his next letter would arrive…<br/>
The days one came would fill me with joy, but I also felt that reading it immediately would be wasteful.<br/>
But I wanted to write my reply so badly, so I would grow impatient and read it carefully, over and over.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> What were they about?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hisano.png"/> Do you know, I've forgotten after all this time. Haha!<br/>
&gt; Hisano smiles.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hisano.png"/> When you find yourself somebody to love, try writing a letter for them.<br/>
Just one line can convey so much more of your feelings than a hundred speeches.<br/>
&gt; Hisano smiles nostalgically…<br/>
&gt; You feel some of the loneliness she is bearing…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I wish I could help her but I'm not sure how I'll ever find those letters.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hisano.png"/> But you know what? I've lost the letters he'd sent to me.<br/>
I thought I kept them in a safe place…<br/>
…Well, I suppose I don't need them anymore, anyway.<br/>
&gt; Hisano looks sad…<br/>
&gt; Maybe having those letters again would cheer her up…<br/>
&gt; You left Hisano and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's starting to get cold out, it kind of sucks. They had some special report on the fog on TV.</i><br/>

<b>Announcer:</b> Now for our next story…<br/>
Mr. Kozai of the Environmental Concern Society visited a local elementary school to investigate the effects of the fog.<br/>
Thick fog has appeared frequently in Inaba over the past few years, and the cause of it has yet to be determined.<br/>
There's been much conjecture on the origin of this fog, and some are concerned about its effects on the human body.<br/>
Town officials believe it highly unlikely that the fog could be harmful.<br/>
One official suggested that the concern is largely tied to public anxiety in response to the recent murders.<br/>
One hearing about the phenomenon, Mr. Kozai visited the local elementary school to investigate its effects.<br/>
He interviewed the children playing happily in the fog about their health and any anxieties they were facing…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Nanako.png"/> Oh, that man came to my school.<br/>
<b>Announcer:</b> Upon completing the investigation, Mr. Kozai issued a statement.<br/>
"In this day and age, one must stay aware of even slight changes in the environment and react politically.<br/>
"Today, I talked with a young student who spoke her own mind, free from the influence of those around her.<br/>
"It was an attitude and an example that we as adults can learn from.<br/>
"Our primary concern should always be to protect these children's futures."<br/>
On that note, Mr. Kozai ended his statement.<br/>
The assembled parents applauded, but some raised concerns that it was a show to attract voters in the next election…<br/>
&gt; The news continues…<br/>
<br/>
<i>While we were watching TV, Nanako started sneezing.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Nanako.png"/> My head hurts…<br/>
&gt; Nanako's face looks red…<br/>
&gt; She has a high fever…<br/>
&gt; You need to put her to bed…<br/>
&gt; You gave Nanako some medicine and had her lie down.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nanako had some hard questions for me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Nanako.png"/> Are you… going back home in spring…?<br/>
It's going to be winter soon…<br/>
If it snows, can we make a snowman…?<br/>
We can play a lot…<br/>
Let's play all the time until spring…<br/>
&gt; …Nanako seems to have fallen asleep.<br/>
&gt; You should take her to bed later…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We've got to do the most we can with the time we have left.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>Nanako was feeling better in the morning fortunately.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Mr. Kondo:</b> I sure hope none of you are wimping out with hand warmers under your clothes!<br/>
Today, I'll focus on building your immunity against colds! That way you'll move on to the next year in good health!<br/>
Does anyone here rest your chin on your hands!? That's a sign that your muscles are weak!<br/>
Let's see, I'll pick Souji, since you hang out with Yosuke, who does that all the time!<br/>
Which muscles do you think are weakening when you tend to rest your chin in your hands?<br/>
<br/>
<i>This was a trickier one than normal.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Kondo:</b> Correct! Bad posture usually comes from your back!<br/>
Come on, don't hunch over because it's cold! Stand up straight!<br/>
Now, I've some special exercises for you! I'm the one who invented them! Haha!<br/>
Everyone! Form a circle!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I had a lot of resources on hand, so I headed down to the Velvet Room to see about that request Margaret had. It took a bit of doing, honestly.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Margaret.png"/> This Yatsufusa has Mediarama… You have successfully completed the quest…<br/>
I can feel your heart.<br/>
Words can express nothing. The only way to convey meaning is through the communication between hearts.<br/>
……<br/>
Souji Seta and Margaret…<br/>
What do those names have in common…?<br/>
……<br/>
Oh no, there's nothing in common.<br/>
……<br/>
I was testing your generosity.<br/>
Good job… You passed the test.<br/>
&gt; Margaret seems a little embarrassed…<br/>
&gt; You became a little more intimate with Margaret…<br/>
<br/>
<i>These always sort of confuse me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00093.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Margaret.png"/> Well then… For my next request…<br/>
What I'd like is a Ganesha with the Tetrakarn ability… If anyone can do this for me, it's you.<br/>
I eagerly await your return.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It turned out I'd actually had that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00097.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Margaret.png"/> Your Ganesha knows Tetrakarn… You have successfully completed the quest…<br/>
Hmhm, what a long nose…<br/>
…By the way, have you heard this song about a long nose?<br/>
"What happens in the Velvet Room nobody knows, but the master has a very long nose…"<br/>
……<br/>
Hmhm, how nostalgic. I used to sing this song with my younger sister…<br/>
How I miss those days…<br/>
&gt; Margaret is smiling, her eyes narrowed…<br/>
&gt; You became a little more intimate with Margaret…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm surprised she's got a sister.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00107.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Margaret.png"/> Well then… For my next request…<br/>
Bring me a Trumpeter with the Mind Charge skill… If anyone can do this for me, it's you.<br/>
I eagerly await your return.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I finished up and went back to school, Naoto was still packing up so I decided to walk her home again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00111.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Naoto is holding a card…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> That 'card' again?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> Yes, it's unmistakable!<br/>
&gt; Naoto nods firmly.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> Judging by its appearance, it's on the same cardstock, the same size, unsigned just like last time…<br/>
I'm almost certain this came form the same person.<br/>
…Let's talk about this someplace more private.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed back to the Samegawa.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00120.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The card reads as follows…<br/>
<b>Writing On The Card:</b> Dear detective, Your prized possessions are in my hand.<br/>
Can you recover them? The game is afoot. -The Phantom Thief<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> It seems this is the work of the figure who snuck into the Shirogane estate.<br/>
I'll send this to Yakushiji-san so he can turn it into the police as evidence.<br/>
The Phantom Thief? How absurd…<br/>
I haven't the time to waste on this…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was surprised she was just going to let it slide.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00128.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> I-I'm not fretting!<br/>
I'm just upholding the Shirogane name in seeing this case through to the end.<br/>
……<br/>
&gt; Naoto is looking down…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> Although…<br/>
He broke into our estate and sent me this challenge…<br/>
Leaving this in the police's hands could jeopardize the honor of the Shirogane name…<br/>
……<br/>
Argh! That's why I don't like this!<br/>
When I'm with you, I always seem to lose my composure…<br/>
I don't want to get involved with this sort of childish game.<br/>
But… to ignore it only makes me angry!<br/>
<br/>
<i>There was only one solution.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> Of course we will… You're the one who brought this to my attention…<br/>
Hrmph…<br/>
…Let's work together on this.<br/>
&gt; Naoto is fidgeting with embarrassment.<br/>
&gt; You decided to accept the Phantom Thief's challenge with Naoto…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Naoto has grown yet deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's nice to have something like this that isn't so deadly serious.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00148.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> Now that it's been decided, let's reexamine the first card.<br/>
There must be some sort of hint there…<br/>
Oh… And of course, I only intend to investigate this case in our free time…<br/>
I… have something else I must do.<br/>
&gt; You walked home partway with Naoto.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nanako even managed to get out to the store, she's really amazing.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00157.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You have the ingredients to make California roll.<br/>
&gt; You decided to make California roll.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You decided to make sushi rice first.<br/>
&gt; What's the key when mixing vinegar with rice?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Did I mention I'm the reigning Iron Chef Inaba?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00164.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The sushi rice smells fantastic.<br/>
&gt; Obtained Noble California Roll.<br/>

<i>Rise brought up something I'd not wanted to think about when she ran into me on the way to school.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00167.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Rise.png"/> I had so much fun last week. There was the Culture Festival, and then we had the sleepover with everyone!<br/>
I was really happy. I thought that I'd never be able to experience things like that anymore.<br/>
…Oh, did you see the weather report? It looks like the weather's going to start getting rough this weekend.<br/>
We need to keep a close eye on the Midnight Channel.<br/>
It hasn't rained lately, so we haven't been able to see it. We might be in for a surprise the next time it's on.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> Let's be careful.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Rise.png"/> Yeah.<br/>
The town seems to think that the case is closed, but the real killer hasn't been caught yet.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I wanted to talk about some things, so I asked Naoto if she wanted to share what I'd made for lunch.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00177.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You ate Noble California Roll together.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Naoto.png"/> This is quite tasty! I'm amazed you can cook so well, Souji-senpai…<br/>
I'm a stranger to cooking…<br/>
B-But perhaps I should learn to…<br/>
&gt; It was Naoto's favorite!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kanji wanted to grab something from Aiya after school so we headed out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00183.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Kanji.png"/> And hey, she's the expert.<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> You're Kanji Tatsumi, right? I'd like to have a word with you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Kanji.png"/> Huh? Yeah, well I wouldn't.<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> …Come with me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> You got a warrant?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Kanji.png"/> S-Smooth, Senpai…<br/>
&gt; Kanji looks happy…<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> Ah… You're the kind that's Tatsumi's been hanging out with lately. I see. So you're in cahoots…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Kanji.png"/> So what if we hang out? What's it to you?<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> …You know there's been a group of teenage bullies lurking around here, don't you?<br/>
We got a tip saying you've been threatening a child at the hill and the flood plain.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Kanji.png"/> Threatening? Child…?<br/>
Oh, him.<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> Hmph, so you admit it. Not a shred of remorse, either.<br/>
<br/>
<i>These guys just didn't get it at all.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00198.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> Oh? So tell me… What was he doing?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Kanji.png"/> Er, that's…<br/>
&gt; Kanji is hesitant to say…<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> You two are going to have to come with us down to the station.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Kanji.png"/> Now wait a sec! Senpai has nothin' to do with this!<br/>
<b>Doll Boy:</b> Oh, Mister. What are you doing?<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> You know these boys, kid?<br/>
Can you tell me how you know them?<br/>
I don't think they're being straight with me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Kanji.png"/> The hell are you telling that kid!? You call yourself a cop!?<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> Did this boy ask you for anything? For instance, did he claim he lost his money?<br/>
<b>Doll Boy:</b> You lost your money, Mister?<br/>
You can have some of mine!<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> Just as I thought…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Kanji.png"/> That ain't…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Luckily, the kid was about to solve the problem for us.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00215.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Doll Boy:</b> I was going to sneak in and leave them at Tatsumi Textiles, but here you are.<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> "Thanks"…? Thanks for what?<br/>
<b>Doll Boy:</b> He made me a bunch of dolls, like a bunny and a cat.<br/>
He's real good!<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> Dolls!? And you're saying Tatsumi made them?<br/>
What a load of… There's no way you're getting me to believe that.<br/>
<br/>
<i>There was really no point in hiding it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00222.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Kanji.png"/> Yeah, Senpai. I got it!<br/>
&gt; Kanji nodded firmly.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Kanji.png"/> Awright, listen up, punks… There ain't any lying about it.<br/>
I made the kid some dolls. What with the ones for his friends and his mom, it was eight all told!<br/>
And lemme warn you… They're so cute, they'll give you diabetes-the instantly fatal kind!<br/>
So what, you want me to teach you how to make 'em!? Huh!?<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> What…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Kanji.png"/> You 'bout to say that ain't like me, right? Go ahead and laugh, dammit!<br/>
Like I care. I'm used to being pointed at.<br/>
And what's most important is, I ain't gonna make this kid or Senpai a liar!<br/>
Hey you! That button's falling off!<br/>
I'm gonna sew it back on, y'hear!?<br/>
<b>Kanji's Mother:</b> Officer..? What are you doing with my Kanji?<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> Oh-Well, Ma'am, there've been several cases of bullying around here, so…<br/>
<b>Kanji's Mother:</b> Kanji had nothing to do with them.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Kanji.png"/> Ma…<br/>
<b>Kanji's Mother:</b> He would never do such a thing.<br/>
He may be stupid and short-tempered, but he's a strong and gentle child.<br/>
<br/>
<i>And then Kanji's mother sealed the deal.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00241.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Kanji.png"/> Y-You old bag! What're you saying!?<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> W-We apologize. If you'll… excuse us…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Kanji.png"/> M-Ma… You'd believe me over the police…?<br/>
<b>Kanji's Mother:</b> You would never do such a thing. A mother knows.<br/>
I need to prepare dinner now… Don't go stuffing yourself at Aiya before coming home.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Kanji.png"/> I…<br/>
<b>Doll Boy:</b> Mister… Are you crying?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Kanji.png"/> N-N-No! I ain't crying!<br/>
This is… snot! I got a cold!<br/>
You wanna catch it!? Huh!?<br/>
&gt; It seems Kanji has grown a bit…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Kanji has grown yet deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I never would have believed this a while ago.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00254.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Kanji.png"/> Senpai… I-I… think I'm gettin' a sore throat with my cold…<br/>
Dammit… M-My nose won't stop runnin'…!<br/>
&gt; You waited for Kanji to calm down, then went home.<br/>
