<br/>
&gt; Will something appear on the TV…?<br/>
<b>Weather Announcer:</b> In other Inaba-related news, meteorologists are predicting heavy fog throughout the year.<br/>
The region has seen an abnormal amount of fog over the past few years, and the cause of the climate change is unknown.<br/>
Whatever the reason, residents of the Inaba area should be extra careful.<br/>
Our broadcast tonight was extended to bring you up-to-date news on the incident in Inaba. The time is now midnight.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Once again the Midnight Channel appeared.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It seems that if the conditions are met, you can see it as many times as you want…<br/>
<br/>
<i>The girl who appeared on the screen seemed awfully familiar.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It seems to be a woman. It looks like she's wearing a kimono…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; The image is so out of focus that you can't tell who it is…<br/>
&gt; What would happen if you touched the image on the Midnight Channel…?<br/>
&gt; Would you be able to touch the person on screen…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I reached out to touch it, but my hand just went through the same way as normal.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You should speak to Yosuke and Chie about this tomorrow.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You decide to go to bed for tonight.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I dreamed of that weird place again. Maybe it's not even a dream. I don't know who those people are exactly, but this time they actually had some answers. And raised a lot more questions.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Igor.png"/> Welcome.<br/>
Do not be alarmed. You are fast asleep in the real world…<br/>
I have summoned you within your dreams.<br/>
&gt; It seems you've been summoned to the Velvet Room…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Igor.png"/> And so we meet again.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Margaret.png"/> This is a space that only those who have, in one way or another, entered into a contract may enter…<br/>
In your daily life, you subconsciously heard the call to awaken, and you chose to follow the destiny of your inner voice…<br/>
…thereby enacting your glorious awakening to your power.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Igor.png"/> Hold on to this…<br/>
<br/>
<i>A blue key appeared in my hands.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Igor.png"/> Your destiny will require you to hone your power, and for that, you will inevitably require our help.<br/>
There is but one price for this assistance…<br/>
You must abide by your contract and assume responsibility for all decisions you may make.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I've never been one to have regrets, luckily.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Igor.png"/> Very well.<br/>
The Persona you have acquired…<br/>
It is a side of yourself that shows itself when you face the world around you.<br/>
Perhaps you can think of it as… a façade of determination you wear to face various difficulties in life.<br/>
You Persona ability, however, is that of the wild card… Compared to that of others, it is very special.<br/>
It is like the number zero… empty, yet holding infinite potential within itself.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Now that made no damn sense at all.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Igor.png"/> The Persona ability is the power to control one's own heart… And the heart is strengthened through bonds.<br/>
As you form bonds by becoming involved with others, your own Social Links will gradually develop.<br/>
The power of these Social Links is what will determine your Persona's abilities.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I wasn't sure I was understanding him properly but it sure sounded like he was saying I could gain vast supernatural power by making friends with people.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Margaret.png"/> Social Links are necessary for more than strengthening your Persona.<br/>
At times, they will help light the way to the truth you are searching for.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Igor.png"/> Where will your awakened power of the wild card take you…?<br/>
I look forward to traveling the road of your destiny together… *chuckle *<br/>
'Til we meet again…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I woke up, and got ready for school. Yosuke had the good sense to not nearly run me over this time.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> You saw what was on last night, right?<br/>
I couldn't tell who it was, but if someone's shown on TV, we can't ignore it.<br/>
Let's go check it out after school. Maybe Teddie can tell us something.<br/>
If it turns out someone was thrown in again, there really might be a culprit behind all this.<br/>
Even if it is something about that place that's killing the victims…<br/>
If someone's using that world as a weapon, that's unforgivable.<br/>
We need to find the culprit… no matter what it takes!<br/>
There's no way the police can do it… Who'd believe that the murderer kills people by throwing them into the TV?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke was sure as hell right about that. Anyway, regular people probably weren't going to be able to do much against those freaky monsters in TV land.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> Hehe… Cool. It's reassuring to hear someone else say it.<br/>
You know, I tried sticking my head inside the TV last night, the way you did, and it actually worked.<br/>
I think I can do that now because I have the same power…<br/>
Persona, wasn't it?<br/>
Could be that we got this gift from someone specifically so we could solve this case.<br/>
Then again, you managed to go inside the TV and get your Persona first…<br/>
I feel like, as long as you're with me, I can find the culprit and crack this case.<br/>
…Well, let's do our best!<br/>
&gt; Even with so much mystery swirling around, Yosuke is trying his hardest to move on…<br/>
&gt; You sense a faint stirring of friendship between you and Yosuke…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I heard that strange voice again. Was this what that Igor guy had been talking about?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; As you form a bond with Yosuke, you feel the power in your heart strengthening…<br/>
&gt; …You recall Igor's words.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Igor.png"/> The Persona ability is the power to control one's own heart… And the heart is strengthened through bonds.<br/>
As you form bonds by becoming involved with others, your own Social Links will gradually develop.<br/>
The power of these Social Links is what will determine your Persona's abilities.<br/>
&gt; Social Links… Is this bond with Yosuke what Igor was talking about…?<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You have established the Yosuke Hanamura Social Link of the Magician Arcana!<br/>
&gt; Yosuke's determination in battle has been enhanced…<br/>
&gt; Yosuke can now take a mortal blow for you in battle!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Anyway, Chie ran in shortly after we got to class. She seemed upset, and it turned out rightly so.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> Um… About yesterday… We're sorry we worried you…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> Oh-never mind that. Is Yukiko still not here?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> Huh? Y-Yukiko-san? Uh… no…? At least, I haven't seen her today.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> Oh man… What should I do…? Hey, is that stuff you were talking about for real?<br/>
You know… All that about how people showing up on the Midnight Channel is related to that other world.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, we were just talking about that. We're thinking of checking it out later-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> The person on TV yesterday… I think it was Yukiko.<br/>
That kimono looks like the one she wears at the inn, a-and she wore it during the interview a few days ago too.<br/>
I got worried, so I emailed her last night, but she hasn't responded…<br/>
I called her earlier in the evening, though, and she said she'd be at school today…<br/>
I-I…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Could Yukiko already be in that other world? It seemed crazy, I'd just seen her myself.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00104.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
  <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> No…<br/>
&gt; You summed up the information you gained in that other world for Chie.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> What's that supposed to mean…? Wait, are you saying… Yukiko was thrown in there!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> We don't know yet for sure. We should check to see if she's safe first.<br/>
Give her another call.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> No good… Her voicemail picked up…<br/>
She's not answering…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> Are you serious…? Then is Yukiko-san inside that place…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> Jus-S-Stop it! Something must've come up, like an errand or something…<br/>
Oh, or she might be helping at the inn… She wouldn't be able to answer her cell if that's it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, but would she skip school for that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> W-Well, I'll give the inn a call… Umm… I've got the number here somewhere…<br/>
C'mon, Yukiko… Pick up…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Thankfully, she picked up. Seems we'd been worrying over nothing.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00118.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> Uh-huh… Uh-huh, I see…<br/>
Hm? Oh. Nah, it was nothing. I'll email you again later…<br/>
*sigh * She was over at the inn.<br/>
She said they had a big group reservation and she had to help out.<br/>
Yeah… Now that I think about it, this has happened before, too. At least once a year.<br/>
She said she'll be at the inn tomorrow, too.<br/>
Oh, for crying out loud, Yosuke! You got me worried over nothing!<br/>
She was totally fine!<br/>
And you were all "Is Yukiko-san inside that place…?" Hmph…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> S-Sorry…<br/>
But there is a reason we thought that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> Oh yeah…? What?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke had a pretty good way to settle all of this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00131.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> I mean, it makes sense, right? People show up on the TV because they're inside the TV…<br/>
But Yukiko-san's still here, in our world. We might want to see what this is about.<br/>
Alright, let's meet up at Junes after school.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Teddie could tell us for sure if something was going on in the other world.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00135.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> O-Okay, I think that's more than enough about my sorry escapades.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> If I hadn't seen the place first hand… I'd never have believed a story like that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah, no kidding.<br/>
Anyways, we need to know what's going on inside-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> Wh-How? By talking to that Teddie guy?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah. Too bad there's so many customers around… I forgot there's a sale in the electronics department today…<br/>
I got it! C'mere a sec.<br/>
Try sticking your hand in and calling him over. I bet that bear's wandering around the entrance anyway.<br/>
Hey Chie, stand over here. Make a wall with me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> A wall?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I stuck my hand in, and regretted it very quickly.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00146.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Something bit you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> Wh-What's wrong!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> Shhh! Not so loud, you idiot!<br/>
D-Dude, is that a bite mark!? Are you okay!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was more surprised than hurt luckily.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00151.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> That's good… Sheesh, that stupid bear must've done it…<br/>
Hey, you! We know you're in there!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> Ooh ooh, is this a game?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> No, it's not a game! Can you sense anyone inside there right now?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> Who's "anyone"? I'm a lonely little bear like always.<br/>
This land feels so bear-ren…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I really hope this isn't the start of a trend. Anyway, we need to watch again tonight and see if it's the same as before.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00158.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> So there's no one inside…? You're sure?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Teddie.png"/> I-I'm not lying! My nose is running as good as ever!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> ……<br/>
I'm gonna go warn Yukiko anyway.<br/>
Since she'll be busy this weekend helping out at the inn, I doubt she'd go anywhere alone, but still…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> Yeah… You'll walk with her to school on Monday, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Chie.png"/> Sure, I'll go pick her up at her house.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> Maybe we'll find out more on tonight's Midnight Channel.<br/>
Cross your fingers that this is all just a misunderstanding…<br/>
What's your cell number? I'll call you when I watch it tonight.<br/>
&gt; You exchanged cell numbers with Yosuke.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Yosuke.png"/> Alright, don't forget to watch tonight.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Adachi.png"/> And we've still got nothing that points directly to a suspect…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Dojima.png"/> We don't even know if this is a homicide.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Adachi.png"/> Well, what else could it be? There's no way a body could end up like that by accident!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Dojima.png"/> …I know.<br/>
We haven't found the cause of death for the first vic, and now we've got a second one just like it…<br/>
If this is a murder case, there's no doubt we're dealing with a single perp.<br/>
But if that's true… what the hell is going on?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Adachi.png"/> You know, I thought at first that this all spun out of that love triangle.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Dojima.png"/> No. That singer-Misuzu Hiiragi-has a solid alibi. She was performing overseas, and her phone records prove it.<br/>
And remember, the only reason the scandal went public was because Hiiragi herself broke it to the media.<br/>
No one would put themselves under suspicion that way if they had murder on their mind.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00185.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Dojima.png"/> Same with Taro Namatame, her husband. No matter how much we shake him down, nothing links him to the murders.<br/>
He's been working in the city for the past six months.<br/>
Seems he was here recently because of the scandal, but he was swamped with work back home at the time of the incident.<br/>
There are eyewitnesses and other evidence placing him at his office the night that Mayumi Yamano died.<br/>
And we can't find anything that shows Yamano making contact with Namatame before of after her disappearance…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Adachi.png"/> You hear Namatame's career has also been killed stone dead? He's been fired from his position as secretary.<br/>
He's practically as much of a victim as the Yamano girl.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Dojima.png"/> Yeah, I agree…<br/>
Then we have the second case, regarding Saki Konishi…<br/>
She's the one who discovered Yamano's corpse… But I don't buy the killer shutting her up as a possible motive.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00196.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Dojima.png"/> The only other connection is that she attended the same school as the daughter of the inn where Yamano was holed up.<br/>
But that hardly points to a motive. Coincidences like that are common in a town as small as ours.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Adachi.png"/> Yeah… I heard about that angle on the news, too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Dojima.png"/> What!? Is the story about the inn out already?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Adachi.png"/> Okay, I got it! How's this?<br/>
Maybe there was something about the corpse that only Saki Konishi knew!<br/>
And our perp killed her to keep whatever it was from leaking out!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Dojima.png"/> ……<br/>
Either way, all we can do now is keep investigating anyone involved with the victims…<br/>
Our perp… It has to be someone in Inaba.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Adachi.png"/> Ooh, is your detective's intuition at work?<br/>

But didn't the stuff she was saying sound weird!?<br/>
And she looked like she was on some low-budget TV show… Was it like this before, too?<br/>
What's going on…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>The only way we could find out what was going on was to get in touch with Yukiko herself.</i><br/>

&gt; You decide to go to bed early tonight.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I keep trying to tell myself that what we saw didn't necessarily mean she was in the TV world now, but I just have this terrible feeling that won't go away. I just hope that if she's in there, we can get to her in time.</i><br/>
