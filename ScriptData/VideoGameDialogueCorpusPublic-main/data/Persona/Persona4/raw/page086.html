	<h3><strong>Part 86:</strong> 11/18/11-11/21/11</h3>
			<b>11/18/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>It was raining by the afternoon. I decided to see if the Fox had anything else for me down at the shrine.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The fox is trying to tell you something.<br/>
&gt; Your Expression is Enthralling, so you can understand the fox's feelings.<br/>
&gt; It seems the fox is worried about the offertory box.<br/>
&gt; The offertory box is empty.<br/>
&gt; What happened to all the offerings collected by the fox…?<br/>
<b>Man's Voice:</b> Alright, outta the way! Out of the way I said!<br/>
&gt; A construction crew came and began working.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I guess whoever runs the shrine decided to spruce the place up.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It seems the money the fox was saving up was used for this.<br/>
<b>Visiting Boy:</b> God, you helped my fried when he needed you. Please, grant my wish, too…<br/>
I brought some of my allowance.<br/>
&gt; The child threw in an offering.<br/>
<b>Visiting Lady:</b> Oh god, granter of our wishes!<br/>
Please, hear mine!<br/>
I'll give you as much as you like!<br/>
&gt; The lady threw in a large offering.<br/>
&gt; It seems those who have heard of the blessings bestowed by the shrine have come to pay their respects.<br/>
&gt; At this rate, the offertory box will be full in no time…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Fox.png"/> *yip *<br/>
&gt; The fox looks exuberant.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Fox.png"/> *howl *<br/>
&gt; The fox went and picked up an ema in its mouth.<br/>
&gt; Obtained Gratitude Ema.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I guess this whole time I've been filling one big wish.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Fox.png"/> *howl *<br/>
&gt; It seems to be a token of the fox's gratitude.<br/>
&gt; You feel an indescribable bond with the fox…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm not sure how a fox makes a wish though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Then again how the hell can it enter the TV?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; By mastering the "Fox" Social Link, the shrine has gained a new function.<br/>
&gt; You are now able to pray at the shrine.<br/>
&gt; By reinforcing your bond, the fox will discount the price of its services inside the TV.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Fox.png"/> *howl *<br/>
&gt; The fox is radiating vigor.<br/>
&gt; It will probably continue its work to revive the shrine…<br/>
&gt; It's getting late.<br/>
&gt; You said goodbye to the fox, who looked somber, and went home…<br/>
<br/>
<b>Feinne's Notes:</b><br/>
Praying at the shrine is super convenient, because it allows you to take a Spend Time action with anyone you have a social link with during the day, even if they're not available. You can't advance the link, but you can make it possible to advance it next time.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh well, I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>11/19/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Incredibly boring day, it rained, I tutored. Not much to say. The fog will come soon.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>11/20/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>The rain is going to end tonight, the fog will come tomorrow. I decided to talk to Daidara, it turned out he had more of Hisano's letters.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Daidara.png"/> Do you remember those letters I gave you before? Well, I found more of them.<br/>
If you want these too, you're more than welcome to them.<br/>
&gt; You decided to take the letters.<br/>
&gt; Received Hisano's Letters.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I also headed down to Aiya for a celebratory Aiya bowl.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You still can't see the rice…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You begin to suspect that your bowl is a portal to the Meat Dimension.<br/>
&gt; The amount of meat contained within this bowl is truly staggering.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; In order to finish this bowl, you must have Understanding of your limits, Knowledge to control your pace…<br/>
&gt; Courage to face this unrelenting tide of beef, and the Diligence to persevere against this colossal challenge.<br/>
&gt; All these traits are necessary to master the Rainy Day Special Mega Beef Bowl Challenge!<br/>
&gt; …However, you are confident you can finish it!<br/>
&gt; You finished your meal!<br/>
<b>Aiya Owner:</b> Aiyaaaa! I'm amazed you finished that entire thing!<br/>
Since you ate it all, your meal is free!<br/>
<br/>
<i>And sure enough the fog came.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Weather Announcer:</b> The week ended on a wet note as rain clouds moved into the area.<br/>
As a result, a thick fog is expected to form in the Inaba region later tonight…<br/>
&gt; It seems the fog will set in tonight…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And of course nobody was on the Midnight Channel.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00078.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; The fog has set in…<br/>
&gt; No one is appearing on the Midnight Channel.<br/>
&gt; Nanako has been rescued and you were able to arrest the culprit…<br/>
&gt; There's probably no need to watch the Midnight Channel anymore…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I guess it's finally all over.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>11/21/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>The fog still hadn't dissipated when I got up for school this morning.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Chie.png"/> Oh, there he is!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yosuke.png"/> Take a look at this. Namatame's in today's paper.<br/>
&gt; The front page's headline article says that Namatame has regained consciousness.<br/>
<b>Newspaper Article:</b> "Today before dawn, the suspect Taro Namatame, who had been confined in a local hospital, regained consciousness.<br/>
"In response to police questioning, he testified that he was sorry for what he has done, and was scared.<br/>
"From here on, the police are hoping to solve the entire care based on the suspect's depositions."<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yosuke.png"/> So it's finally over…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Chie.png"/> Yeah… Seriously…<br/>
I wish we could've done it sooner…<br/>
Isn't the fog kinda thick this morning? And it's so chilly… brrrr!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> It rarely gets this cold in November…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Just then Adachi stumbled in. I'm really not sure what his deal is sometimes. He had good news but then he just started rambling about things.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00096.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Adachi.png"/> Perfect timing. I just got a call from the hospital.<br/>
They said that starting today, it's okay to visit Nanako-chan.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Chie.png"/> So she's getting a little better… Thank goodness!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Adachi.png"/> Oh, is that today's paper? So you already know about him…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Souji.png"/> How's Namatame doing?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Adachi.png"/> He's regained consciousness, but it's hard to say…<br/>
He's still mentally unstable, but we're slowly piecing together his story.<br/>
This is still a secret, but I guess it's okay to tell you guys…<br/>
You know that diary we found? There were entries about Ms. Yamano and Ms. Konishi in it.<br/>
Looks like Namatame had been making advances on Ms. Konishi.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yosuke.png"/> That son of a bitch…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Adachi.png"/> U-Uh, well… I'm gonna head to the hospital now.<br/>
Dojima-san's recovering too, so I need to go over a few things about this case with him.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke seemed pretty pissed. Honestly though, I'm thinking they must have misinterpreted something because I remember talking to the guy around town and he was moping about Ms. Yamano like it was a full time job.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00110.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yosuke.png"/> Sorry… I'm all right.<br/>
Namatame's been caught. He can't hurt anyone now…<br/>
But forget him! Let's all go visit Nanako-chan after school!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Chie.png"/> Of course!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> Let's tell the others once we get to school.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Finals are coming up next week, I'm not really worried so much.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00116.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Ms. Sofue:</b> They're flying high, thinking they'll pass at first, but once it's over… their faces turn to pale white…<br/>
Hohoho, speaking of turning white, are you all familiar with Othello, a game named after Shakespeare's play?<br/>
Some say it's named to demonstrate the drastic change in the relationship of the black general and his white wife.<br/>
Just goes to show you, even games have histories.<br/>
Hohoho… You might think this is of little importance, but I recommend you get this down in your notes.<br/>
Tests are much like history… You never know what's going to be in them… Hohoho…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed through the fog to the hospital after school.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Nanako.png"/> Mm…<br/>
Big… bro…<br/>
&gt; Talking still seems painful for her…<br/>
&gt; Nevertheless, Nanako looks happy…<br/>
<b>Nurse:</b> Dojima-san!<br/>
*sigh * How many times does this make it today?<br/>
I understand that you're worried about your daughter, but you still need your rest too!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Dojima.png"/> Ngh… S-Sorry.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Yukiko.png"/> Um… Are your injuries that bad?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Dojima.png"/> Hm… Well, my wounds have just closed up, and it seems I have a couple of fractures as well.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Adachi.png"/> I'm sorry. I'll wheel him back to his room immediately.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Dojima.png"/> What're you apologizing for…?<br/>
<b>Nurse:</b> It's almost time for your checkup, so make sure you're back in your room before then.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Nanako.png"/> Big… bro…<br/>
……<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nanako still seems very ill.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00140.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Nanako.png"/> Yeah… I'm so glad…<br/>
……<br/>
&gt; Nanako closed her eyes with a relieved expression.<br/>
&gt; …She seems to have fallen asleep.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Dojima.png"/> ……<br/>
<br/>
<i>We all left the room so she could sleep. The doctor had some worrying news for us outside.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00146.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Doctor:</b> Her condition is stable for now, but…<br/>
I never though I'd say this as a doctor, but… We still can't figure out the cause of Nanako-chan's symptoms.<br/>
That's why we can only administer temporary treatments to alleviate her current pains.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Dojima.png"/> But she's not in danger anymore, is she?<br/>
<b>Doctor:</b> She's regained consciousness, but we can't let our guard down yet…<br/>
All we can do for now is to monitor her condition closely…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Dojima.png"/> ……<br/>
Adachi. How's it going with Namatame?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Adachi.png"/> Well, he's awake now, but he's in no condition to tell us anything useful.<br/>
We only get a little time each day to interrogate him, so we're stuck until his strength recovers.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Dojima.png"/> I see… I should get back to work as soon as possible.<br/>
Hopefully by then, Nanako will be out of the hospital…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Adachi.png"/> Umm… I think Nanako-chan can get more peace and quiet if she stays here.<br/>
It's so foggy out, and there's been some weird rumors going around…<br/>
Seems like no one knows why there's so much fog in town.<br/>
<b>Doctor:</b> It's true. The number of patients complaining about fog-related health problems has increased…<br/>
Which is quite unusual…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think I heard a rumor about the fog myself a while back, but it's just silly to think it's dangerous.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00165.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Doctor:</b> I can't say for sure that it has no effect on the human body…<br/>
It certainly could be a psychological effect. People's anxiety over the fog could cause problems.<br/>
But as far as the fog's chemical makeup… Well, that's not my field, so I can only speculate.<br/>
What concerns me is that transportation of our medial supplies has been delayed due to the fog…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Dojima.png"/> Fog-related health problems… Now that's just ridiculous.<br/>
Anyone who says that is just blowing smoke.<br/>
&gt; Nanako has somehow regained consciousness…<br/>
&gt; But it seems that it will take more time until she fully recovers…<br/>
&gt; Namatame's interrogation has finally begun…<br/>
&gt; The fog that won't lift, and people's mysterious health problems…<br/>
&gt; For now, it seems that you can only watch and wait to see how things will turn out…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Why does this fog worry me so much? I mean we caught Namatame. That should be the end, right?</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>Elsewhere…</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>Passing Housewife:</b> I've never seen anything like it.<br/>
<b>Shopping Housewife:</b> I wonder what's causing it. It's so creepy…<br/>
I heard that a friend of mine's son got sick from the fog and collapsed.<br/>
You know how sensitive children are to that sort of thing.<br/>
<b>Passing Housewife:</b> I heard something too…<br/>
They say an old man was driving through the fog and got into an accident.<br/>
<b>Shopping Housewife:</b> What? Did he lose control?<br/>
<b>Passing Housewife:</b> Well, he'd never been in an accident or even gotten a ticket before, so something seems off… Isn't that scary?<br/>
<b>Shopping Housewife:</b> I've even heard there are experts saying it's poisonous. I wonder if that's true…<br/>
<b>Passing Housewife:</b> Do you think it's, you know, because of that global warming thing?<br/>
This town's changed a lot over the years. I wish the government would step in and do something about this.<br/>
<b>Shopping Housewife:</b> Oh, I agree completely. If we're going to pay taxes, I expect the authorities to do their jobs.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00191.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Gas-Masked Man:</b> Don't inhale the fog, or you'll die!<br/>
<b>Shopping Housewife:</b> He's not the first one like that I've seen latey.<br/>
<b>Passing Housewife:</b> Poisonous gas, though…?<br/>
<b>Shopping Housewife:</b> Oh, I'm sure it's not true…<br/>
<b>Passing Housewife:</b> ……<br/>
<b>Shopping Housewife:</b> Hm? Is something wrong?<br/>
<b>Passing Housewife:</b> Oh my… I-I think I'm coming down with something…<br/>
<b>Shopping Housewife:</b> Y-You can't be serious… Ahaha…<br/>
That's right, I needed to do some grocery shopping. Well then…<br/>
