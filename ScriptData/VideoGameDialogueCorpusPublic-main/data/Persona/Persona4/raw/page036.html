<i>Morooka status: still a douche.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Morooka.png"/> Your brains aren't smart enough to retain this by just listening. Make sure you write all this down in your notes!<br/>
Incidentally… it seems some students have been extorting money from each other at school again.<br/>
You know… nothing good comes out of guys your age. You assholes can't even distinguish good from bad.<br/>
How do those indiscreet punks get away with doing whatever they want in town, thinking they're some big shots!?<br/>
Let's see… Amagi… No, I think I'd rather go for Hanamura, who seems to be indiscreet!<br/>
Deductive reasoning or inductive reasoning: which one uses one or several examples to draw a conclusion?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Tch, damn King Moron…<br/>
Psst, hey Souji… Which one?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I at least definitely am discreet.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Morooka.png"/> Ahh… I suppose I underestimated you.<br/>
Or did someone give you the answer? If you punks have a talent for anything, it's whispering to each other.<br/>
Well, anyway, Hanamura is correct.<br/>
Deductive reasoning is a reasoning which states that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.<br/>
I'd write that down if I were you. You'll be the ones crying your asses off when you get it wrong on the test!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yosuke.png"/> Errr… I guess he's right, but the way he says it pisses me off…!<br/>
…Souji, thanks, dude. You just saved me from more of King Moron's shit talking…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I went to drama. Yumi wasn't there again, so I visited her in the hospital afterwards. Her father's still hanging in there, but nobody's sure for how long. I'm still not quite done that model, but I'm getting closer.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>7/5/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Nothing really much happened today, soccer was uneventful. Oh, I finished that model.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You silently assembled the complex pieces…<br/>
&gt; You have one piece left over!<br/>
&gt; You remember that it was a spare piece. Whew…<br/>
&gt; The model robot has been completed!<br/>
&gt; Obtained MF-06S Brahman. You should show this to the man at the model shop, then put it on your shelf.<br/>
<br/>
<i>So at least there's that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>7/6/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ai asked me if I wanted to hang out again, so we headed to Okina after school.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You came here because Ai insisted…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Ai.png"/>Hmmm… I don't really feel like buying stuff today.<br/>
What should we do instead?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Souji.png"/> Let's just chill.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Ai.png"/>What? You mean you don't have any kind of plan? Sounds boring…<br/>
Oh well. Maybe you'll be able to make it interesting.<br/>
&gt; Ai seems willing enough…<br/>
You know, it's pretty funny…<br/>
If I didn't sign up to manage your team, you wouldn't be here with me now.<br/>
Looking at it from your perspective, I'd say you got pretty lucky.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Souji.png"/> I appreciate it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Ai.png"/>Haha, I guess you should be thanking me.<br/>
&gt; Ai looks almost happy…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Ai.png"/>It was your advisor who put me on your team.<br/>
He said something like, "Ai, being on a team should teach you something about putting someone besides yourself first!"<br/>
I don't understand people who play sports in the slightest…<br/>
But I guess it wouldn't kill me to go cheer you on every once in a while.<br/>
&gt; Ai smiles with self-importance for some reason…<br/>
&gt; It seems she's begun to like you a little…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I still don't quite get Ai though. Things got kind of weird just after that because some guy from school ran over to us.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Yasogami Student:</b> H-Hey, u-um, Ai-san!<br/>
U-Um, us meeting here like this… I-It must be f-fate, right!? So, um…<br/>
Y-You w-wanna go o-o-out with me sometime!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Ai.png"/>Ha, are you kidding me?<br/>
Have you looked in a mirror recently?<br/>
&gt; Ai rejected him without a second thought…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It was pretty harsh but honestly not surprising at all to me that she said that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Ai.png"/>Well, a guy has to look at least on par with me before I'd consider him.<br/>
That, and he has to click with me, I guess… Besides, I'm not interested in dating anyone right now.<br/>
&gt; Ai speaks with indifference.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Ai.png"/>*sigh * I'm bushed. Let's go home.<br/>
&gt; You returned to Inaba with Ai and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh, and Nanako had gotten some sweet potatoes so I made some daigaku-imo.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You have the ingredients to make daigaku-imo.<br/>
&gt; You decided to make daigaku-imo.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; …You made the sweet sauce.<br/>
&gt; How should you prepare the sweet potato?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Obviously you deep fry it, as even a child would know.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00086.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You stir the sweet sauce into the fried sweet potato.<br/>
&gt; Obtained Crispy Daigaku-imo.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's gonna be good.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>7/7/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Daigaku-imo status: Eaten with Yukiko. As predicted it was good.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You ate lunch with Yukiko.<br/>
&gt; You ate Crispy Daigaku-imo together.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yukiko.png"/> Oh, it's really good! Did you make this on your own, Souji-kun?<br/>
The flavor is excellent, and the presentation is great, too… Do you want to work as a chef at our place?<br/>
I'm just kidding…<br/>
…Though you'd be more than welcome, if you wanted to…<br/>
&gt; It was Yukiko's favorite!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh and it's a good thing I'm a master of pointless trivia.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Hosoi:</b> "Man" means "10,000" in Japanese, but that doesn't mean it has 10.000 poems. In fact, it has less than half that.<br/>
The ancient Japanese people used the term to point out how huge the collection was.<br/>
Now, why don't we read a passage? …Oh wait, I just remembered! Today is Tanabata, the Japanese star festival!<br/>
Why don't we study some poetry from the Man-yoshu that relates to Tanabata?<br/>
Let's see, since he's probably never seen a sky full of stars, let's pick on Souji-chan!<br/>
Which poet wrote the most poems about Tanabata in the Man-yoshu?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean this is just screamingly obvious.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00107.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Hosoi:</b> Right. Kakinomoto no Hitomaro has written 137 poems about Tanabata.<br/>
I'm amazed how many he wrote. He was certainly a talented writer.<br/>
Back then, Japanese people could relate their own lives to the myth of Tanabata, or the story of Orihime and Hikoboshi.<br/>
You know, you guys have it good, the ancient Japanese weren't allowed to see each other even when they were dating…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh, and fox wish status: Completed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00115.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Despondent Man:</b> You actually built it… Wow, it's good… Well-made…<br/>
&gt; The man is tearing up…<br/>
<b>Despondent Man:</b> Making plastic models takes a lot of time, huh? The time you spend makes the love for your creation deeper…<br/>
*sniff *<br/>
Haha, I must be getting old…<br/>
I was recalling the days I spent toiling away at plastic models…<br/>
It was fun… But it's all in the past now…<br/>
Thank you. By giving me a final glimpse of this joy, you made me realize that this phase of my life has passed.<br/>
I thank you… Oh, and the shrine, too. I finally feel like I can find something else to live for.<br/>
&gt; The man is smiling sadly…<br/>
<b>Man With Closure:</b> Oh, yeah. You can have this, too. I have fond memories of this model…<br/>
I don't need it anymore. It's time to move on…<br/>
&gt; You obtained Unfinished Model.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Something strange happened at soccer practice today.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00134.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Soccer Player:</b> *gasp * I… can't… run anymore…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Daisuke.png"/> That's when you've gotta push yourself! C'mon, one more lap! I'll run with you!<br/>
<b>Soccer Player:</b> Yes, Sir…<br/>
&gt; Daisuke is coaching with passion…<br/>
<br/>
<i>It seems Daisuke's got his edge back.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00139.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Daisuke.png"/> But damn, it feels good!<br/>
I'm not gonna screw around anymore. From now on, I'm all business!<br/>
&gt; Daisuke suddenly appears pensive…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Daisuke.png"/> I kept pretending that I was trying my hardest… But the truth is, I was hardly trying.<br/>
If I managed to do well playing at half my potential, nobody really cared that I wasn't taking it seriously.<br/>
And if I wasn't doing so hot, I had a copout. All I had to do was say I wasn't trying.<br/>
I was scared of the possibility that things could go wrong, even when I gave it my all.<br/>
Because if that happened… I would have felt like I had no business even being here…<br/>
Haha… Pretty lame, huh?<br/>
This is for you.<br/>
&gt; Obtained Spike Brush.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Daisuke.png"/> It's a brush you can use to clean your cleats.<br/>
I realized I haven't used it in a long time… I just soaked my cleats and let 'em hang dry, like I didn't care…<br/>
But I used to like cleaning my cleats and soccer balls…<br/>
I don't know why I'm doing this… It just kinda popped into my head, y'know?<br/>
It's not super fancy or anything, but it's easy to use. You and I are gonna be running a lot from now on, so…<br/>
…Come on, let's grab some grub before we go home!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We grabbed Kou and headed for Aiya.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00157.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kou.png"/> I've been hearing people talk about ya, Daisuke.<br/>
"He's a new man!" "A demon awoke inside of him!" Words to that effect.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Daisuke.png"/> Yeah, well, I quit pretending. I was getting pretty bored of not taking things seriously.<br/>
You give it 110%, and sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. Not knowing is what makes it fun.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kou.png"/> Ain't that the truth? Lay the charm on thick, get rejected, and cry about it later. That's a woman for you.<br/>
Still, too bad about your ex, though.<br/>
You were kinda hoping she still liked you, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Daisuke.png"/> What? H-Hey, that's not-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kou.png"/> Whoo boy, look at his face. I think I've seen tomatoes less red than that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Daisuke.png"/> Wh-What about you guys, huh!? All that "What am I to you" shit, you're the ones who should be embarrassed!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kou.png"/> What, you want us to say it again? Maybe in unison this time?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Daisuke.png"/> Don't give me that touchy-feely crap!<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You spent quality time with Daisuke and Kou.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Daisuke.png"/> But yeah, uhh…<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kou.png"/> Don't worry, we'll always be here to embarrass you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Daisuke.png"/> …Gee, thanks.<br/>
&gt; You feel a deep bond has formed between you, Kou, and Daisuke…<br/>
<br/>
<i>This one felt different than the others.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00178.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>And I heard that weird voice again, but this time it said something new.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00179.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Daisuke.png"/> I feel like I can finally move forward again…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kou.png"/> That's good, man.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Daisuke.png"/> So, let's do another group date. Kou, you should call those chicks up again.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kou.png"/> Huh!? Now you're gonna pull a 180 on me!?<br/>
Dude, you really ticked those girls off last time!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Daisuke.png"/> Oh, I guess you'll have to do some groveling then.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Kou.png"/> ME!?<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You take a moment to enjoy the good times with your friend, with whom you have formed a tight bond…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm not sure exactly who Zaou Gongen is, but I guess I could have his power at some future date. I went to the hospital to clean up, not much happened. The rains are coming soon, and the fog will come along with them I guess. It can't be good that fog from the other side is coming here, though we've not seen any problems from it yet.</i><br/>
