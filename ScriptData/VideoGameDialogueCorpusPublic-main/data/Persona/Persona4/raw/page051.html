			<b>8/26/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>Chie called me up, we headed to the Samegawa to train for a while.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You decided to train with Chie.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> In the movie I watched the other day, this guy knocked down a tree using only his leg!<br/>
How does someone kick that hard…? Just practice?<br/>
<b>Takeshi:</b> Ch-Chie!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Oh, hey Takeshi…<br/>
W-Were you robbed again?<br/>
<b>Takeshi:</b> No…<br/>
I took off right after that, right? So I thought I'd apologize…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> …Why don't you be a man and admit you ran away?<br/>
<b>Takeshi:</b> Wh-What…? Were you this anal before?<br/>
Tch, if you lose that sunny attitude, you won't have anything left.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I seriously hate that asshole Takeshi. Should've let those punks beat the hell out of him.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Takeshi:</b> Speaking of which… What's up with Yukiko-san?<br/>
I saw her with you the other day…<br/>
She seemed weirdly cheerful… She had this funky laugh, y'know…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> That funky laugh… That's how she really is.<br/>
<b>Takeshi:</b> Oh, you've rubbed off on her, huh? I can't believe it…<br/>
That's not Yukiko-san… She was better gloomy…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> ……<br/>
…Look. If you get into trouble again, I'll step in and help.<br/>
<b>Takeshi:</b> …Huh? Oh, uh… Thanks…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> So why don't you shut your mouth about Yukiko!?<br/>
You don't know anything about her! She's a good person, got it!?<br/>
<b>Takeshi:</b> Wh-What the hell?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Takeshi ran off, which is good because I was feeling like knocking his teeth in.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Way back, I saw Yukiko sitting by the road, holding a dog. I asked her what's up and she said she ran away from home…<br/>
She'd picked up the dog, but her parents told her she couldn't have a pet, and that she'd have to get rid of it…<br/>
She looked like she was dead or something… I tried everything I could think of to make her laugh.<br/>
And that's how we became friends…<br/>
From that moment on… I told myself I'd protect Yukiko…<br/>
But… Somewhere along the way, I messed up, and that Shadow popped out…<br/>
After that, I thought I'd try to focus on what's good about me.<br/>
I swore to quit being nothing but the girl Yukiko can rely on…<br/>
So… I just tried my best.<br/>
At finding the culprit and stuff… just generally being more reliable… That's all.<br/>
……<br/>
I feel like I missed the point…<br/>
<br/>
<i>You can't solve your problems if you aren't aware of them.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> …Thanks. You're too kind.<br/>
Maybe… half a step?<br/>
&gt; Chie is smiling happily.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> I wonder if there's anyone out there… who can say, "This is what makes me worthwhile!"<br/>
I guess everyone's looking for it…<br/>
&gt; Chie was able to take a step forward and face herself.<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Chie has grown yet deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And Chie's moving forward.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Chie.png"/> Oh yeah… That dog Yukiko picked up? It's gotten really fat at my place.<br/>
Come by and see it sometime! It smells, but it's cute!<br/>
…Maybe I'll walk it over to your house.<br/>
&gt; You talked with Chie about various things while going home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nanako had to write a book report for her homework.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> For today's homework… I have to write a book report.<br/>
I already finished reading the book, so I just need to write about it. A king goes deep into the forest, and…<br/>
&gt; Nanako puts a lot of effort into her book report.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> He was all alone… so he wasn't angry or sad…<br/>
The king said he was happy… But I feel sad for him…<br/>
……<br/>
Um, big bro?<br/>
Do you feel happy when you're alone?<br/>
<br/>
<i>That's such a hard question.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> I see…<br/>
Maybe I should write about you, too…<br/>
&gt; After Nanako finished her report, you put her to bed and returned to your room.<br/>
<br/>
<b>8/27/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Still some homework to do, since it was crappy and raining again I worked on it a bit more. Not quite done yet, nor is Nanako.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> I'm doing my art homework today.<br/>
I have to make something out of stuff I find in the house.<br/>
A milk carton, a paper towel tube… Knitting wool, origami paper…<br/>
What else do we have?<br/>
Is someone here today too?<br/>
&gt; Rise and Kanji came by.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Rise.png"/> Senpai said that Nanako-chan was doing her summer homework. You should've told me!<br/>
…But, it looks like I picked the wrong day to come. I can't do any of this art stuff.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> Me neither…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kanji.png"/> Huh… Let me see what you've got.<br/>
&gt; Kanji carefully crafts something with incredible detail…<br/>
&gt; …and creates something that no elementary student could make!<br/>
&gt; After putting Nanako to bed and saying goodbye to Rise and Kanji, you went to your room.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Man, Kanji is talented, I'll give him that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>8/28/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I probably should have done some more homework today, but Rise called me up and I decided I can probably get it done tomorrow.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00096.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You came here at Rise's request, as she says she likes it here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Rise.png"/> When I first got to town, I used to sit here and do nothing…<br/>
I would just listen to the sound of the river, the sound of the birds, the sound of the rain…<br/>
I felt I could forget "Risette" and find myself that way…<br/>
But…<br/>
Senpai, have you ever thought that you're pushing yourself too far, or that you were just acting…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Heh. I've thought I might be pushing myself too far every damn day since we found out there was a crazy world inside the TV.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00103.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Rise.png"/> Really…? Then you might even be a better actor than me.<br/>
But I see… You've been through a lot too…<br/>
&gt; It seems Rise is a bit relieved.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Rise.png"/> I feel like I've been able to relax after coming to Inaba.<br/>
Meeting all of you, laughing together… Watching the store, reading comics, playing with the cat…<br/>
…When I was at my parents' house, I was on my best behavior around them…<br/>
Oh, but Grandma doesn't ask me anything. Y'know, like why I quit or what I'm thinking of doing next…<br/>
She just talks about tofu. She says… I'm like tofu.<br/>
I had to ask her what that meant.<br/>
The way she explained it… Tofu looks weak and fragile, but it's actually pretty resilient.<br/>
Even though it stands out because it's not like any other food, it can be mixed in with any recipe or flavor…<br/>
Tofu is incredible.<br/>
I'm nothing like that…<br/>
……<br/>
I…<br/>
I was actually bullied at school before I made my debut…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I wouldn't have even believed it unless it was her saying it herself.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00120.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Rise.png"/> I was alone the entire time…<br/>
But I didn't have a problem with that. No one expected anything of me.<br/>
And then… the application my relative sent without telling me passed the first audition.<br/>
I wasn't interested in being an idol, but… I wanted the chance to change myself…<br/>
And just by chance, I won.<br/>
Haha… When it happened, I panicked, thinking maybe I should turn their offer down.<br/>
Then I thought… if I appeared on TV, I could make friends…<br/>
That was literally the only reason I went through with it…<br/>
After a while… I realized something.<br/>
The person everyone likes, the one they say "hi" to on the street? That's not the real me.<br/>
Risette is the one everyone likes… The fictional character they sold the public.<br/>
…It's the same with you, isn't it?<br/>
You don't have to deny it… I won't be mad.<br/>
You're with me right now because I'm Risette, yeah?<br/>
<br/>
<i>If Risette ever existed at all I never met her, it's Rise who I've been hanging out with.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00135.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Rise.png"/> ……<br/>
I'm sorry. That wasn't a fair question.<br/>
…But I'm happy you said so.<br/>
&gt; Rise smiles weakly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Rise.png"/> When I got back to school after my debut, no one bullies me…<br/>
I was happy at first, with people I didn't even know talking to me…<br/>
But they weren't suddenly interested in Rise Kujikawa…<br/>
They wanted to hang out with Risette.<br/>
The bullying stopped, but… I felt like none of them saw the real me.<br/>
In my heart, I've always thought… "This isn't the real me…"<br/>
Funny, huh? I was the one who wanted to change, and…<br/>
But none of that matters now! I'm done being Risette!<br/>
Now I have people who know the real me.<br/>
Plus, I have power that can help everyone… I love that!<br/>
This time, I'm going to change into a Rise that everyone can like!<br/>
Keep an eye out for her, Senpai!<br/>
&gt; Rise is smiling…<br/>
&gt; You feel that you understand Rise even more…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm still not sure Rise has decided who she really wants to be.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00154.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You walked Rise to her house and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nanako had to write a report on her favorite animal for her homework.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00158.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> I have to write a paper about my favorite animal.<br/>
Hmm… Which one should I choose…?<br/>
Oh, I know! There's a picture of it on that shirt that Dad bought…<br/>
What's it called? A platypus? I'll write about platypuses!<br/>
&gt; Nanako eagerly begins researching platypuses…<br/>
&gt; She doesn't seem to need any help… But you make sure she's on the right track.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> The platypus lays eggs.<br/>
And they have poisonous claws!<br/>
…Question!<br/>
Is it the male or female platypus that has the poison claws?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Souji.png"/> Male.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> Corrrect!<br/>
You're smart, big bro!<br/>
&gt; Nanako is impressed.<br/>
&gt; After Nanako finished her research, you put her to bed and returned to your room.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm sort of surprised she likes platypuses, but they are cool I guess.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>8/29/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I just had to get all the homework done during the day today, things are starting back way too soon for comfort. Nanako was almost done as well, though I didn't do quite as well as I'd been doing up to now.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00187.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> This is the last thing I have to do for my homework.<br/>
I just need to write a picture diary.<br/>
Umm…<br/>
"Big bro… and Dad…"<br/>
Um, let's see… August 27th…<br/>
Ah…<br/>
I don't remember the weather…<br/>
Um, big bro?<br/>
Did it rain the day that we worked on my art homework?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I was sort of preoccupied at the time.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00197.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> …Was it?<br/>
Mmm…<br/>
&gt; Nanako seems puzzled…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Nanako.png"/> ……<br/>
"Big bro… and his friends… helped me… a lot… with my homework…<br/>
"They were so nice… I like them so much…"<br/>
…No! Don't look!<br/>
&gt; Nanako has finished all of her summer homework…<br/>
&gt; After putting Nanako to bed, you went to your room.<br/>
<br/>
<i>School's starting back up soon. At least this semester will be a lot more sane.</i>
