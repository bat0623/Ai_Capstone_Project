	<h3><strong>Part 46:</strong> 8/2/11-8/5/11</h3>
			<b>8/2/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>Nothing much happening right now, still no news on what's going on down at the PD. It was a nice day and Yukiko wasn't busy at the inn so we went for a walk by the river.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>8/3/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Got an unexpected call today.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Ai.png"/> I wanna go somewhere. You'll come, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> Sure.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Ai.png"/> Cool. Don't be late.<br/>
&gt; You decided to go out with Ai.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We headed down to Okina.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Ai.png"/> I'm getting kinda tired of this place… There's nothing left to do here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> I agree.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Ai.png"/> Hey, you're not allowed to get bored!<br/>
I chose you to come here with me, so you better enjoy it!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Rise had also come down to Okina I guess.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Rise.png"/> ……<br/>
I didn't think you'd have time to be making small talk with other girls…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Ai.png"/> Shut up.<br/>
I believe Souji was talking to me. It's rude to interrupt.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Rise.png"/> …What's wrong with you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Ai.png"/> …Don't you dare talk to other girls when you're with me!<br/>
&gt; You've had an exciting day…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Much more excitement than I needed in a day. Facing down Shadows was less scary than that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>8/4/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Um. I might have said or done something dumb today. I went back to the shrine with Yukiko, she wanted to leave a wish.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Yukiko brought you here, saying she wanted to pay her respects.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Yukiko.png"/> Are you going to wish for something, Souji-kun?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> For everyone…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Yukiko.png"/> …I see. That's so like you.<br/>
&gt; Yukiko looks happy.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Yukiko.png"/> I'm wishing for everyone's health.<br/>
For Chie, for you, for the others… And everyone at the inn, too.<br/>
And…<br/>
I'm wishing to become a woman worthy of you… Souji-kun.<br/>
Finally, I wish for everyone to be able to smile together…<br/>
…Let's begin our prayer.<br/>
<br/>
<i>As I had thought, Yukiko didn't really want to leave.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Yukiko.png"/> I never really objected to being the inn's manager per se…<br/>
I just didn't like the fact that it wasn't up to me… I felt that my life was on rails.<br/>
And I thought running away was the only choice for me…<br/>
But no longer. I want to protect the family inn.<br/>
After all, it's near to my heart…<br/>
…Thank you, Souji-kun. I think it's because of you that I realized this.<br/>
Because you were always by my side…<br/>
&gt; Yukiko is smiling gently…<br/>
&gt; Yukiko's determination makes her look more mature…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean what are friends for if not to help each other out?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Yukiko.png"/> U-Umm, I wanted to ask you this before…<br/>
……<br/>
Wh-Why…<br/>
Why are you always with me…?<br/>
I-Is it okay… for me to ask…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>So yeah I think I'm really bad at reading signals or something because after I said this she got really flustered and ran off.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Yukiko.png"/> I see…<br/>
……<br/>
Y-Yes, precisely!<br/>
Oh, I just remembered… I have an errand to run! I'll be going now…<br/>
&gt; Yukiko ran off…<br/>
&gt; You decided to go home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>This just goes to show that you can ace your exams and still make incredibly dumb choices you may never live down.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>8/5/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>I tried to find Yukiko to apologize for yesterday, but I think she must've been busy. I ran into Rise while I was looking, and headed down to Okina with her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Rise took you here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Rise.png"/> Whew, that was a long trip…<br/>
It'll take time to get back, so let's walk around quick!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Souji.png"/> You come here often?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Rise.png"/> Yeah. You know there's not much of a selection where we live, right?<br/>
Since I've got a mule with me today, I think it's time for a shopping spree!<br/>
&gt; Rise looks like she's having fun…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Rise.png"/> Oh, come to think of it, where does Kanji buy his clothes?<br/>
You can't find pointy stuff like those at Junes, can you?<br/>
Does he buy them online…?<br/>
……<br/>
Maybe he makes them…?<br/>
<b>Suspicious Guy:</b> U-Umm…<br/>
A-Aren't you Risette?<br/>
I, I-I-I-I…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Rise.png"/> No… I'm not.<br/>
Let's go, Senpai.<br/>
&gt; Rise dragged you away…<br/>
&gt; Many people approached Rise over the course of the day…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I would really hate to have people recognizing me everywhere I go.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00086.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Rise.png"/> *sigh * But I told them!<br/>
I told them today, Senpai!<br/>
"No, I'm not." "You're mistaken." "I'm not Risette!"<br/>
And it's true… I'm no longer "Risette"…<br/>
I'm just an ordinary girl…<br/>
*giggle * Which is fine with me!<br/>
I never thought I'd be out in public like this.<br/>
I love Inaba, Senpai…<br/>
You see the same faces every day, rumors spread fast, and there are times when it gets on my last nerve…<br/>
And sometimes I feel I might be better off if I was in a big city full of strangers…<br/>
But even then, I love that town.<br/>
You're there, Grandma's there…<br/>
And above all, there's something I can do there.<br/>
Let's keep at it, Senpai!<br/>
&gt; You can sense Rise's passion…<br/>
&gt; You feel that you understand Rise even better…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still, I'm glad she's happy now.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00103.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh, and Rise said something about her Persona feeling more powerful.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00106.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; She is now able to use the skill Treasure Radar!<br/>
&gt; You can now see the location of all the treasures on the dungeon map!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Rise.png"/> I didn't see any one-pieces that clicked with me, so I guess we should go home.<br/>
Let's go, Senpai.<br/>
&gt; You walked Rise to her house and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Why is all this supernatural stuff still going on, though? I mean we caught the killer… right?</i>
