<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> That's him all right… It's definitely the guy on the Midnight Channel!<br/>
It's settled, then. He is the killer… and he's in here now!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> This guy came to our shop before…<br/>
Was he… spying on me…?<br/>
Oh my God… I really was being targeted…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> Dammit! Frickin' punk!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Hey, I've seen him before too… Hmm…<br/>
Oh, now I remember!<br/>
Yukiko, it's that one guy!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> That one guy…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Back in April, remember!? He suddenly came and started hitting on you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Oh, him! The dude who got served by Yukiko in front of the school!<br/>
Man, Chie, how'd you remember something like that!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Well, that was the first time he talked to her, but I remember he was always following her around.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> Um… Sorry, who are we talking about?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> The dude who came right up to you at the school gates and called you Yuki!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> Ohhhh…<br/>
Uhh… Really?<br/>
<br/>
<i>That guy really did get served pretty hard there.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> Um… I didn't really reject him…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> He came up to me while I was busy working and asked, "Don't the biker gangs bother you?"<br/>
Just going on and on about how biker gangs can't do anything unless they're in a pack and stuff…<br/>
He seemed to be the type who just keeps talking, whether you like it or not… if that make sense…<br/>
I usually treat those people politely so they don't get offended, but I was so tired that I kinda ignored him.<br/>
Was that why I was kidnapped…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> Huh…? Wait, I'm not a biker!<br/>
Ugh… That damn special report… So that's why I got dragged into this.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> You know, I heard he'd been saying stuff about that announcer's affair, too.<br/>
Lots of muttering about how women who cheat on their husbands should be executed.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Sounds like it's all coming together…<br/>
Well, it's time for a showdown!<br/>
Can you tell where this Mitsuo guy's at?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> I'll give it a try. Just a sec…<br/>
…Yeah, I found him!<br/>
He's that way.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Alright, let's go!<br/>
We're so close to the killer… We can't lose him now!<br/>
<br/>
<i>When we reached our destination, we found the strangest place yet.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Well, he did taunt us, saying "Try and catch me"… I guess he thinks of all this as a game.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Ohhh, this pisses me off! I hereby sentence him to a hundred kicks to the face!<br/>
Let's go!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Souji.png"/> Man, this is old school.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Gotta admit… All guys love games.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Teddie.png"/> And all girls love Teddie!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Anyway we entered the creepy video game castle. It's quite hard to describe.</i><br/>

<i>The floor was just as disjointed. In certain areas, the floor would turn around if we tried to advance.

<b>Boss Battle: Killing Hand</b><br/>
This mini-boss is a total joke. He starts out by summoning an Almighty Hand. He'll also use multi-target physicals like Deathbound, but probably not much because he's got such a small amount of health that you should be able to drag him down in record time. What I'd suggest is to use multi-target attacks whenever an Almighty Hand is up to ensure that it goes down quickly as well, because it's actually probably more dangerous than the Killing Hand. When the Killing Hand dies any remaining hands will likely run away, as they do in the video.<br/>

<b>Boss Battle: Momentary Child</b><br/>
Momentary Child is a pretty simple bonus boss compared to the ones in the castle or sauna. He's weak against ice, so if you bring Chie, Teddie, and an ice persona of your own he'll go down in a heartbeat. He mostly uses physical attacks, and he'll sometimes lose a turn being 'indignant' with no effect. <br/>
<br/>
<i>We got some valuable confidence and Teddie found a really nasty looking claw that he started swinging around in a worrying fashion. With our task complete we returned to Void Quest.</i><br/>

<br/>
<b>Boss Battle: Shadow Mitsuo</b><br/>
Okay, this guy can be a real asshole if you're not prepared. We start out by fighting Mitsuo the Hero, a giant 8-bit warrior. He takes two actions every time his turn comes up, either an Attack on someone or a Bomb that does damage and causes the Exhaust status. This form is largely unthreatening as long as we use items or Teddie's Energy Shower to keep Exhaust off of our party and keep people healed. When we kill Mitsuo the Hero, Shadow Mitsuo is exposed and is Downed, giving us an All-Out Attack. Now the fight gets interesting and we face the first boss with a  really random and arbitrary way of fighting that can hose us if we have the wrong party. Shadow Mitsuo also gets two actions each time its turn comes up, and he'll spend one of the first two casting a Wall spell. He'll then use an action on each of the next three turns he gets casting a group attack spell of that same element. If he knocks someone down with that he'll use Megidola and wreck the party. Then, he'll have a vocal taunt and things will get much worse.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-P4-00205.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Shadow_Mitsuo.png"/> There's no need to be scared. It'll be quick.<br/>
<br/>
In this phase, Shadow Mitsuo will start by using Stagnant Air to greatly increase the chances of you being hit by status effects. He will then start using Evil Touch on people to fear them, and if anyone is feared at the start of his turn he'll use Ghastly Wail to instantly kill them. After a bit he'll use the skill Whisper to start regenerating Mitsuo the Hero.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00209.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> The shell takes time to finish forming…<br/>
Destroy it before that happens!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Shadow_Mitsuo.png"/> Why…? Don't you want to be at ease?<br/>
<br/>
If we can do enough damage to him before he regenerates the shell fully, it'll break and he'll be Downed, giving us another All-Out Attack. At that point he'll focus entirely on regenerating his shell, which is pretty much impossible to stop. He'll use Chant and then Prayer, at which point Mitsuo the Hero is back.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00215.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That ominous message tells us that Mitsuo the Hero is stronger now, which he is indeed. He does more damage with his Attack and Bomb, and now he can use his Spell, Gigadyne. Gigadyne does large amounts of Almighty damage to the party, and he'll use it for sure as his first action. Once again you want to burn Mitsuo the Hero down as fast as possible while keeping Exhaust off of people. Once it dies, Shadow Mitsuo returns. It works exactly the same way, with another random element chosen at the start. You want to go at Shadow Mitsuo as hard as possible now to ensure he dies before he can regenerate his shell again, because Mitsuo the Hero is very powerful if he gets to return again.<br/>
<br/>
The party I used for this is Chie, Yukiko, and Teddie. Teddie gives us the ability to cure Exhaust and both he and Yukiko are brutally powerful on this boss. The last slot is actually sort of a toss-up because Yosuke, Chie, and Kanji are all pretty similar on this boss. I'd suggest not using Yosuke because he has the same weakness as Teddie personally. I'd also suggest you get to about level 43 so that Yukiko gets Mediarama and Teddie Matarukaja. Black Frost is incredible on this fight but really any decent Persona will do, just watch for his magical attacks in the Shadow phase because if he gets a Megidola off you're likely to lose.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Somehow we triumphed over the freakish thing.</i><br/>

<i>I don't know, I was and still am skeptical about all of this for some reason.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-P4-00254.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Mitsuou.png"/> Get off my back… I already told you… I did it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> Why…? How could you do such a thing?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Three people are dead because of you…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Mitsuou.png"/> Ha… ha… haha…<br/>
Hahahahahaha!<br/>
Everyone's talking about it, right?<br/>
It's a huge deal… and I did it! All of it! All by myself…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> You just wanted the attention…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> Then why did you target me and the others? How did you kidnap us?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Mitsuou.png"/> *gasp * *gasp *<br/>
Whoa… Look who it is… Haha, hey Yuki…<br/>
After all this time… now you wanna talk to me? Haha… What bullshit.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> Answer me! If you held a grudge against me, that's fine…<br/>
But why the others!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Mitsuou.png"/> Ha… Haha, what a joke… You're so desperate it hurts…<br/>
I didn't care who I attacked… Everyone pisses me off…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> You what…?<br/>
…gotta be… kidding me…!<br/>
You killed Senpai over nothing!? …You son of a bitch!!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kanji had heard enough meanwhile.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-P4-00274.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Mitsuou.png"/> *chuckle * What, you gonna kill me?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> Kanji-kun!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> Kill you…? It ain't gonna be that easy, you piece of shit. What you did can never be taken back.<br/>
No, you're gonna own up to your crimes and pay for what you did.<br/>
You ain't gonna be allowed to kick the bucket until you understand exactly what it is you've done!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Mitsuou.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Why, dammit…? Why did she have to die because of this bastard…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Mitsuou.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> Dude… The cops.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> What're you waiting for!? Call the damn police!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Y-Yeah… You're right…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Yosuke…<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Well, I guess this means our work is done…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> He did it all to draw attention… I can't get my head around that. It's just wrong.<br/>
I mean, not that it would've been okay if he had a better reason…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I know… Don't worry.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> It's all over… Let's leave the rest to the police.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Teddie2.png"/> My world will be peaceful again now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> Yeah. I'm happy for you.<br/>
We really went through a lot…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Teddie2.png"/> Like scoring with guys!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> Oh, come on…! Will you ever let it go?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> What…? Scoring with guys!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> Y-You don't need to know the details.<br/>
I'm sure you'd like us to forget the sauna incident too… right, Kanji-kun?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> Urgh… W-Well…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> That's not fair… I wanted to see everyone else's too!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> That's right. We three are the only ones who saw everyone's secret.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Hey, so what was Yosuke's like? C'mon, it's about time you told us.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It wasn't really special, kind of boring compared to some of the others really.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-P4-00306.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> C-C'mon, let's leave it at that!<br/>
Speaking of which, nothing really happened in your case, huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> Really… Wait, really? Is there something special about Senpai after all?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Teddie2.png"/> Sensei is da man!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> But now that the case is solved, we won't be calling you "Leader" anymore, will we…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Oh yeah… It's kinda sad.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> Hey, why don't we have a celebration?<br/>
We always have a wrap party after we're done shooting. It's fun, and it'll help give us some closure.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Oooh, a party! That sounds great! Let's go all out!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Teddie2.png"/> Ooh, ooh! I wanna go to Yuki-chan's house!<br/>
Gorgeous dinner, hot springs, table tennis, yukata! Geisha, Fujiyama, full wootness!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> You're right, Yukiko-senpai's family runs a hot springs inn…<br/>
A-A hot spring that… Yukiko-senpai bathes in too…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, keep it to yourself… You're sounding like a creep.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's a shame this couldn't have happened during school, though, with the summer in full gear the Amagi Inn was booked solid.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-P4-00321.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Yeah, it's summer vacation. All the rooms must be occupied.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Teddie2.png"/> We can't do a sleepover…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> Maybe next time. I promise.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, why don't we hit your place instead?<br/>
Oh, but will your uncle get suspicious? Like, "Why are you all celebrating?"<br/>
<br/>
<i>Of course this is Dojima we're talking about, so while yes he would get suspicious, he'd have to be there to do it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-P4-00328.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Then it's settled. Nanako-chan can join in, too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Oh yeah, if your uncle's a detective, he might not come home tonight…<br/>
Nanako-chan might be getting hungry.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> Hey, then why don't we make dinner together?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> Wow… Are you good at cooking, Senpai?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> W-Well… sort of?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> What are you saying…?<br/>
Did you already forget the tragedy of the school campout!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> W-We already told you that was an accident!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> She's right! We just got a couple of the ingredients wrong!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Guys, please don't do this, I'm begging you… I don't need another trauma to deal with…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> Hey, I'm a good cook too!<br/>
I'll make something for you, Senpai.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Teddie2.png"/> Tadaaaah! Teddie has a great idea!<br/>
Let's have a cooking battle! The winner will be crowned Iron Cook Inaba!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> A cooking battle? Now I'm even more worried…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> S-Sure, that sounds like fun.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> Aww, but I'll win hands-down. You sure you want to make it that easy?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke wisely tagged me in for this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-P4-00347.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Help us, Souji Seta! You're our only hope…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Then you can represent the guys' team. Nanako-chan will be our judge!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> I can be a taster too!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Teddie2.png"/> Teddie can be a tester too!<br/>
At the end, you're supposed to say, "That was delicious!" right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Woo! I'm getting all fired up!<br/>
Alright! Let us advance forth into the grocery section downstairs! Chaaaarge!<br/>
<br/>
<i>First we had to call Nanako and see what she wanted.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-P4-00357.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Nanako.png"/> Yeah, he said he's gonna be late today.<br/>
Huh…? Dinner? You're all going to cook?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Ask Nanako-chan what she wants for dinner!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Nanako.png"/> What do I want…?<br/>
Um… Anything's fine.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> She's just being modest! Ask her again.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Nanako.png"/> Well, umm…<br/>
An omelette.<br/>
I wanna eat omelette with fried rice.<br/>
Okay, I'll be waiting!<br/>
&gt; You ended the phone call.<br/>
&gt; Nanako seems to be looking forward to it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Fried rice omelette… An excellent choice, Nanako-chan.<br/>
With a dish that simple, I doubt we'll get a second helping of Mystery Food X.<br/>
…Huh? What's wrong?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> …N-Nothing. Alright, let's go get our ingredients.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Uh… If they're all making the same thing, why are they splitting up to different parts of the market…?<br/>
Looks like you'll need all the help I can give you…<br/>
Hey, what kind of omelette are you making? I'll go get the ingredients for ya.<br/>
&gt; What kind of omelette should you make…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I decided not to go too terribly far afield, I mean it's for Nanako and all.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-P4-00378.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You gave Yosuke a list of the ingredients you'll need…<br/>
&gt; Everyone brought their basic ingredients to the cart.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Foie gras!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> Quite an eye you got there, Senpai.<br/>
It's a must-have for my special omelette!<br/>
Don't worry, I'll let you have a taste. Ooh, or maybe I could spoon feed you. *chuckle *<br/>
I heard last time you choked down something so awful that words couldn't describe it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> It was horrible…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> You poor dears… Who would do such a horrible thing…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> R-R-Rise-san? This is gonna be the only chance you get to gloat, is that clear?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> …I'll crush you with one strike.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> Whoa… You guys look like you're ready to enter the Ultimate Frying Championship.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> Kanji-kun! That's alcohol!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> Huh…? Oh, uh… Hahaha…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> By the way, where's Teddie?<br/>
<br/>
<i>By the way, that question is never one you want to hear, because the answer will always horrify you.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-P4-00394.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Sample Tray Lady:</b> Of course you can, dear. Eat as much as you like!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Teddie2.png"/> You're such a nice lady. Is this one cooked already?<br/>
<b>Sample Tray Lady:</b> *giggle * This one's ready too.<br/>
Oh my, are you hungry for more? Here… I'll open this one too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Teddie2.png"/> You're so beautiful…<br/>
<b>Sample Tray Lady:</b> Oh my, no! No, I mustn't! I've got a husband and a son!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Teddie2.png"/> But I really want this meat… And I want you to cook it, Miss.<br/>
<b>Sample Tray Lady:</b> Ohhh, I couldn't possibly. The manager would get so upset.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> I'm gonna knock the stuffing outta that bear…<br/>
<br/>
<i>We dragged Teddie out and all headed back to my place, where the cooking began in earnest.</i><br/>

……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Nanako.png"/> Wow! It's really Rise-chan!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Teddie2.png"/> I should go back over there soon…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Nanako.png"/> Are you going somewhere?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Teddie2.png"/> Yep… The guys kept their promise.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Nanako.png"/> A promise, huh…<br/>
What if you made a promise with me? Could you stay then?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Teddie2.png"/> A promise… with Nana-chan?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Nanako.png"/> Um… A promise that you'll play with me. How about that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Teddie2.png"/> Sensei… You kept your promise with me…<br/>
So I should go back over there…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I couldn't send Teddie back to that crazy world all alone.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Souji.png"/> You promised Nanako…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Teddie2.png"/> S-Sensei…<br/>
My promise with Nana-chan… I made a promise to play with her…<br/>
Can I really stay here…?<br/>
It wasn't just my promise. Nana-chan made it with me…<br/>
I'm really… really happy…<br/>
Thank you…!<br/>
&gt; Teddie's eyes are watering…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yosuke had something to say about it too.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Teddie2.png"/> Yosuke… I have a new promise to keep…<br/>
S-So, I wanna stay here a little longer! Is that okay with you, Sir!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Huh? What're you talking about? You're not going anywhere.<br/>
You can't just quit your job like that. In any case, if you left-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> It's reeeeeaaaaadyyyy! Incoming food! Out of the way, Senpai!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Whoa! Ow!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We sat down for the judging of our ultimate competition.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-P4-00437.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> W-Well, wait a sec.<br/>
Asking Nanako-chan to jump in and try these for us is kinda… unethical.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> D-Don't look at us like that!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> Ohhh… So it's our job to taste it first, to make sure we can keep it down.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> Hey! That's mean!<br/>
Then try mine first, Yosuke-senpai. It's guaranteed delicious!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> You don't mind me going first? Actually, I've been looking forward to yours.<br/>
I mean, Risette cookted it herself. Can you imagine how many guys would kill me if they found out?<br/>
Well then, chow time!<br/>
Urgh…<br/>
I-I… can't give this to Nanako-chan…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> Ooh! It's so delicious that you won't let anyone else have a bite!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Have you ever been to a circus and seen guys eat torches? Yeah.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-P4-00450.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; …It's spicy!<br/>
&gt; The spiciness and heat are like lava in your mouth…!<br/>
&gt; You can't taste or feel the foie gras at all…<br/>
&gt; It's starting to taste like iron… For some reason, you sense a dull pain in your mouth as well…<br/>
&gt; You can't give this to Nanako…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> Here, try mine next.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> I'll take this one.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> K-Kanji… That's a lot…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> H-Hey, say something.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> Well… Uh… How do I put this…?<br/>
I tastes really, um… boneless…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> What!? That's not a word you use to describe taste!<br/>
Does it taste good or not!? Tell me!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I will say this: It was a huge improvement on Mystery Food X.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-P4-00464.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; But you don't sense any flavors in particular…<br/>
&gt; In fact… you don't taste anything at all! You can't even taste the ingredients…<br/>
&gt; How could this be…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> Not good, that's for sure. It tastes like… Like I'm eating plain oatmeal…<br/>
It's pretty impressive that you put so many ingredients into a dish and it came out tasting like nothing.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> Y-Your palate just isn't refined enough!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Nanako.png"/> …I think it tastes good.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> Nanako-chan…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> O-Okay… Try mine next.<br/>
Urgh… I dunno about this… But I think it'll taste good! This time for sure!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Teddie2.png"/> I'll give it a whirl.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> H-How is it…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Teddie2.png"/> Wow, this tastes awful!<br/>
You have to try this, Yosuke.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Dude, not after you say that…<br/>
Ahhh… I see…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And seriously Chie is terrible.</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-P4-00481.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Well, um… It's a huge improvement over the curry…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Yeah, thanks for the consolation… I feel soooo much better…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Nanako.png"/> I think this tastes good too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Nanako-chan…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> Oh yeah, they're right…<br/>
They're totally right! It tastes awful! Ahahahaha!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Then try Rise-chan's I bet you anything mine tastes better than hers!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Yukiko.png"/> U-Urhg…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> S-Senpai!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> Sure enough… One strike.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> Well, Yukiko and Chie's didn't taste good either… But at least theirs didn't cause any casualties… Haha…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> I-It's a taste too subtle for kids! It's a mature flavor!<br/>
You guys are just kids… I, I…<br/>
*sniff * Waaaaaaah…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Nanako.png"/> Ngh…!<br/>
It's spicy, but it's still good.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> Nanako-chan…!<br/>
I knew it! Nanako-chan's the most mature person in this room!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> C-Crocodile tears!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Of course, there was at least one edible omelette.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Nanako.png"/> You did!? Ooh…<br/>
This is really good!<br/>
I've never had an omelette with fried rice this good! It's amazing!<br/>
&gt; The omelette seems to be a big success. She's eating it extremely cheerfully!<br/>
&gt; Nanako finished your omelette…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> Are you full, Nanako-chan?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> We're still starving…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chie.png"/> If you're so hungry, then help yourself to an awful-tasting omelette! Hmph!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> U-Uh, I have a suggestion…<br/>
You guys know about the festival they're holding in the shopping district, right? Why don't we all go?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Rise.png"/> Oh, that sounds good!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Teddie2.png"/> Whoa! Does that mean the girls will be wearing yukata!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Nanako.png"/> A festival…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> We'll bring Nanako-chan along too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Nanako.png"/> I can come?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Wouldn't dream of going to a festival without bringing her along of course.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-P4-00519.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Nanako.png"/> Really!? Yay!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Yosuke.png"/> That settles it, then.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kanji.png"/> Festival food always tastes great for some reason, even if it ain't anything fancy.<br/>
Whew… We'll finally be able to get some edible food for once.<br/>
&gt; You promised the others you'd go to the festival at the shopping district.<br/>
&gt; The culprit has finally been caught. The rest is up to the police inquiry…<br/>
&gt; The festival is on August 20th. You made sure not to forget this date.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't know, even though we caught the guy it doesn't feel like we've got any real closure. What the hell's even been going on? Why did the Midnight Channel appear? What the hell is this power of Persona? Will we ever know?</i>
