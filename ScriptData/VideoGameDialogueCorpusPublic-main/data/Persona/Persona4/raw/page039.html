<i>I keep trying to make myself forget that exams are right around the corner, but everyone won't stop talking about them.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Depressed Girl:</b> Finals start next week. *siiiiiiiiiiiiigh *<br/>
<b>Easygoing Boy:</b> Senpai, you look pretty down.<br/>
That's not good for you, y'know? Once they're over, summer vacation isn't far behind, right?<br/>
<b>Depressed Girl:</b> Shut it, puny underclassman! I have to study for my college entrance exams!<br/>
Once you're a third-year student, you'll get a taste of what it's like to take tests all year.<br/>
*sigh *<br/>
<br/>
<i>Also I never thought I'd say this but I really miss Morooka.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kashiwagi.png"/> Well, don't worry about that for now. …The hot and humid days just keep on coming.<br/>
It's the perfect time to have eel. I just loooove that slimy texture.<br/>
By the way… Does anyone know why eels are slimy?<br/>
They have a protein called mucin that, due to agglutination, can precipitate the small particles.<br/>
I learned all that on TV. And they say it makes your skin smoother!<br/>
I'd recommend that channel. I'm sure one day you'll all look back and thank me for this precious information.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I wanted to hit the Velvet Room so I headed down to the shopping district. That gas station attendant noticed me passing and we had a chat.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Attendant:</b> Country life has gotten a lot more convenient than it used to be, but…<br/>
Convenience isn't the only good thing in life, is it?<br/>
Or something like that, ahaha… I've been here for a while, so I think like that sometimes.<br/>
…But compared to the city, I bet it's still pretty inconvenient here.<br/>
<br/>
<i>When I finished up I headed back to school. Chie's been stressing out about the exams so I decided to help her out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Ugh…<br/>
…Souji-kun, you free today? Maybe you could tutor me… Or not…<br/>
Alright! Let's head for the library!<br/>
<br/>
<i>We got a lot done, I was pretty happy with it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chie.png"/> Got it! Thanks for helping me, Souji-kun!<br/>
&gt; You were able to get more studying done by teaming up with Chie.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We had some ingredients around, so I decided to delve again into the land of dessert.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You have the ingredients to make crème caramel.<br/>
&gt; You decided to make crème caramel.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You made the base with egg, milk, sugar, and other ingredients…<br/>
&gt; How should you give it some scent…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean we only had one thing a civilized person would consider using.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It's done to perfection.<br/>
&gt; Obtained Smooth Crème Caramel.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm pretty happy with how it turned out, and it's not going to be terrible tomorrow so I'll even get to enjoy it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>7/13/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>No point having a delicious dessert if you're not going to share it with someone. Yumi's been really down about her father, so I decided to try and cheer her up.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Yumi.png"/> I think I like men who know how to cook. Do you think you could make me something for next time, too?<br/>
…Thanks a bunch!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Mr. Kondo was still pretty shaken up about Morooka dying I think.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Kondo:</b> …I still can't believe Mr. Morooka was taken from us. The faculty office is still in shock too…<br/>
But we can't sob about it all day! Today we're gonna put the "physical" back in education!<br/>
We're gonna play rugby! And don't even think about getting lazy because it's hot!<br/>
I know some of you probably don't know how to play, but don't worry! Rome wasn't built in a day!<br/>
Don't space out, Souji! I've got a question for you!<br/>
What does "Rome wasn't built in a day" mean!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean this one is so old I can't believe anyone doesn't know it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Kondo:</b> Excellent!<br/>
Of course, "keep trying" would have been close! You can't give up before you build your empire! Keep at it!<br/>
By the way, that proverb was originally written in French! Mr. Hosoi told me that.<br/>
What a great proverb! I just might put that on the test! Don't forget it!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think I found the person who made that last wish, but I'm not quite sure how to handle this one.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Female Student:</b> Wh-What, don't just walk up to me and talk to me all of a sudden! Don't you know that's rude!?<br/>
Oh…<br/>
Umm…<br/>
S-Sorry for blowing up like that. It's fine. I'm not in a hurry to go anywhere or anything.<br/>
So…<br/>
&gt; The female student is mumbling and obviously flustered.<br/>
&gt; Perhaps she's the one who wrote the ema request the fox showed you.<br/>
&gt; She wants to improve her conversational abilities.<br/>
<b>Awkward Girl:</b> What do you want? S-Stop staring at my face!<br/>
&gt; Her word are harsh…<br/>
&gt; You don't have enough Understanding to continue the conversation.<br/>
&gt; Maybe if your Understanding was Generous you would be able to talk to her.<br/>
&gt; The awkward girl raw away.<br/>
&gt; Maybe you should talk to her again next time you see her…<br/>
<br/>
<i>That Namatame guy was by the river, poor guy seems really bent out of shape over something.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00084.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Namatame.png"/> Mayumi…<br/>

<i>Yukiko was going to pick up some things at the grocery so I went along to consult.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00091.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Yukiko brought you here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> I wrote down everything I need, so this shouldn't take that long.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Souji.png"/> Gotten any better yet?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> That's… I hope so.<br/>
&gt; Yukiko is smiling sheepishly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> I'm studying the basics of the basics.<br/>
But it's not turning out quite like it does in the book, even though I'm following the directions.<br/>
<br/>
<i>She clearly wants to learn this for herself, this goes beyond just being about cooking.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Yes. Practice makes perfect.<br/>
&gt; Yukiko nods…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> I think there's no point unless I do it alone…<br/>
Our cooks help me out all the time.<br/>
At first they just give me advice, but eventually they take the knife from me.<br/>
So even if the meal turns out wonderfully, it doesn't mean anything that way…<br/>
I told them to leave me alone, but they still stay and watch.<br/>
Are they that worried about my cooking…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think Yukiko doesn't realize how much the people who work at the inn care about her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00108.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> They care about… me?<br/>
Do… Do you really think so?<br/>
&gt; Yukiko looks surprised, but happy…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Last time, the head chef took the knife from me, shouting, "I can't stand to watch anymore!" and made the rest.<br/>
The waitress saw it and said to the head chef, "Yuki-chan wants to make it herself, even if it's awful…"<br/>
Before I knew it, I was "studying how to cook for a boy I like"…<br/>
My parents got involved and it exploded from there… *giggle * Funny, isn't it?<br/>
But… maybe it wasn't all a lie.<br/>
……<br/>
T-Taste my food again, okay…?<br/>
&gt; Yukiko is blushing…<br/>
&gt; You felt a faint hint of love from Yukiko…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukiko's a real kidder.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00121.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yukiko.png"/> Ummm… Oh yeah, shopping!<br/>
&gt; You helped Yukiko with her shopping and walked home partway together.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dojima and I had a talk about a few things, nothing major.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>7/14/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>So today we learned the dire truth behind at least one major mystery.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00128.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Hosoi:</b> Well, to be honest, us teachers are kind of afraid ourselves. The culprit is still on the loose.<br/>
But there's no sense wasting time moaning about it. The bright, warm sun is shining on us. Let's get to work.<br/>
…Open your textbooks and find the excerpts from… The Pillow Book.<br/>
In fact, I just remembered. There're a few passages about sunlight here, like one called "In Spring it is the Dawn."<br/>
Interestingly, the term "dawn" has many meanings. For example, there's both civil and nautical dawn. Souji-chan!<br/>
Here's a question for you. Nautical dawn or civil dawn, which one's brighter?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Clearly it's civil dawn. I shouldn't have to explain why.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00135.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Hosoi:</b> Yep, civil dawn is brighter! I'm surprised you knew. There really isn't that much difference, really.<br/>
Nautical dawn is when you can barely see the sunlight, and civil dawn is when it's bright enough to distinguish objects.<br/>
I'm gonna put this on next week's test! Make sure you memorize that, mmmkay?<br/>
By the way, my wife made this doll for me by hand. Don't you think she did a great job making it look like me?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kanji wanted to get some food so we went to Aiya.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00146.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You came here at Kanji's request…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Kanji.png"/> Man, I'm starving for some Chinese!<br/>
But if I eat and then go home, I can't finish Mom's food… She serves so much, you'd think I have five brothers.<br/>
She's tryin' to make my stomach burst.<br/>
<b>Middle-Aged Man:</b> Aren't you Kanji Tatsumi? What are you doing here?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Kanji.png"/> Can't you tell?<br/>
Hey, you're a cop. What do you mean, what am I doing?<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> Just what I said. There's been quite a commotion around here lately.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Kanji.png"/> Well maybe if you did your job, thing's get quieter, huh?<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> Y-You need to fix that attitude…<br/>
…Oh well. Just don't pull anything, got it?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Kanji.png"/> I didn't…<br/>
<b>Police Officer:</b> *sigh * I'm gonna eat somewhere else.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Kanji.png"/> Asshole.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I guess this happens to Kanji a lot.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00162.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Kanji.png"/> Meh, I'm used to it…<br/>
……<br/>
Sorry for getting' you mixed up in this, Senpai…<br/>
I really am just a troublemaker. For you… and for Mom.<br/>
She's always apologizing for me. She's been sprouting more and more white hairs…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean if he's really concerned about it he should tell her that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-P4-00168.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Kanji.png"/> I-I know, but… It's just kinda awkward…<br/>
&gt; Kanji looks troubled…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Kanji.png"/> Filial piety, right? I don't really know what to do…<br/>
…Or so I thought.<br/>
I'm gonna use this power I got to make this town peaceful!<br/>
I've been causing nothing but trouble, but now I can finally return the favor!<br/>
So let's get to it, Senpai!<br/>
&gt; You can feel Kanji's enthusiasm…<br/>
You feel you understand Kanji even more…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Little by little it seems Kanji is trying to change.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-P4-00178.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Kanji.png"/> …Hey Chief, the food ready yet?<br/>
<b>Aiya Owner:</b> Huh? You ordered something, Kan-chan?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Kanji.png"/> I told you not to call me Kan-chan! And I did order: liver-leek stir fry and pot stickers!<br/>
Tch! I'm gonna tear your store apart so fast you won't have time to file for insurance!<br/>
Oh, uh, well…<br/>
I'm gonna tear it apart and rebuild it twice as good! I-I'm gonna RENOVATE your ass!<br/>
<b>Aiya Owner:</b> …Sounds good to me.<br/>
&gt; You went home after eating at Aiya.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I watched some TV with Nanako, something was bothering her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-P4-00191.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; It's a documentary about a young man searching for his real father…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; Nanako is staring into the TV.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Nanako.png"/> Real… father…<br/>
What do they mean by "real"?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Souji.png"/> A person you love a lot.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Nanako.png"/> Oh, okay… Then you're my real big brother.<br/>
&gt; Nanako looks really happy…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Nanako.png"/> And Dad's my real father!<br/>
……<br/>
But I don't think Dad really loves me…<br/>
Maybe…<br/>
……<br/>
Maybe I'm not "real" to him?<br/>
Daddy doesn't come home because I'm not his "real" daughter?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm certain that's not it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-P4-00207.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Nanako.png"/> …No.<br/>
&gt; It looks like Nanako has stopped worrying…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Nanako.png"/> Mom…<br/>
Why'd she leave me?<br/>
…When Mom was still here, we all went out together…<br/>
We picked flowers at Samegawa…<br/>
&gt; Nanako talked a bit about her memories…<br/>
You understood Nanako's true feelings a little better.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Poor Nanako. I wish I could spend every night with her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-P4-00216.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Nanako.png"/> Hey… Big bro…<br/>
&gt; It's about Nanako's bedtime…<br/>
&gt; What should you do…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>We stayed up talking a bit past her normal bedtime.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-P4-00222.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Nanako.png"/> Yay!<br/>
Ummmm… Ummmm… Then, let's play the word game!<br/>
&gt; Nanako looks happy.<br/>
Then we'll start with... "w" from "word!" W… W… Worm!<br/>
&gt; You played a word game with Nanako.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We can't do anything for now, just have to wait things out.</i>
