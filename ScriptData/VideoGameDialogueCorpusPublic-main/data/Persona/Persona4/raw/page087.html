<i>This damn fog is still covering the town, and everyone's getting freaked out.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Guy With A Backpack:</b> The weather's really been weird lately. What's up with all this fog?<br/>
This fog looks like it's going to say here forever.<br/>
<b>Lazy Student:</b> But I heard it's noooothing to worry about. That's what some great guy on TV said.<br/>
Oh, I also heard it's poisonous. Veeeeery toxic! And nobody even knows why it's toxic!<br/>
…Maaaan, just thinking about how toxic it is makes me feel ill.<br/>
I should probably say home for a while. *cough *<br/>
<b>Guy With A Backpack:</b> You're just too lazy to take the finals beginning next week, aren't you?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't know if I'm more or less worried knowing what I do.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>Mr. Yamada:</b> Luckily, we've got an inn right here in town. Now only that, but the manager there is young and beautiful! Yeah?<br/>
Unfortunately, my family is more interested in a ski trip than going to an inn…<br/>
What's the point of going somewhere so cold? Are they that desperate to see the snow?<br/>
I said to them, if you wanna see snow, why not go to the glacier in South America?<br/>
Hmm? I see doubt written all over your faces.<br/>
You've never heard of it? Hmm, why don't I turn this into a question… Souji-kun!<br/>
What's the name of the glacier in South America?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm an expert in South American geography.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Yamada:</b> Wow, you're a smart fella. And yes, it's a rather special glacier between Chile and Argentina.<br/>
Of course, I was just joking about going there. The weather is so harsh, very few people ever go…<br/>
But I don't think my wife gets it. She's been picking up brochures about South America…<br/>
She's really too gullible. How could she not be at least a tiny bit guarded about going to a glacier…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>None of us really felt like studying.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> *sigh * I don't feel like taking tests…<br/>
How, whatcha doing today?<br/>
If you're going to check up on Nanako-chan, I'll tag along.<br/>
Alright! Then let's go.<br/>
<br/>
<i>We all headed down to the hospital.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Nanako.png"/> ……<br/>
&gt; Nanako seems to have noticed your presence and woke up…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Souji.png"/> We came to see you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Nanako.png"/> Thank… you…<br/>
&gt; Nanako is smiling weakly…<br/>
&gt; Nanako's condition doesn't seem like it's getting any better…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Yosuke.png"/> Nanako-chan…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie2.png"/> ……<br/>
&gt; Your friends are as worried about her as they would be about themselves…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I headed out to tutor Shu after we got back from the hospital.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Shu.png"/> …This forms a circle here, with a radius equal to the base of the triangle… and the height is… uh…<br/>
&gt; You began to explain the problem to him in an easily-understood manner.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Shu.png"/> Um…<br/>
What do you think of your school?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Souji.png"/> It's boring.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Shu.png"/> …I guess schools are like that everywhere…<br/>
&gt; Shu nods to himself.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Shu.png"/> Moving on to the other matters…<br/>
There's a transfer student in my class.<br/>
He looks down on everything here and says we're all a bunch of hicks living in the boonies. Everyone ignores him.<br/>
……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Souji.png"/> Well, it is the countryside.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Shu.png"/> You're right…<br/>
&gt; Shu laughs…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Shu.png"/> I guess being out here is like being the proverbial "frog in the well."<br/>
Oh, uh… That's what he said. That he was the frog because he, uh…<br/>
That he's from the city, and out here is the country, and, uh…<br/>
…...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Despite how easy it is for him, Shu clearly has a hard time at school.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Shu.png"/> All my classmates are stupid, and the lessons they try to teach are absolutely pointless.<br/>
…Your lessons are a lot easier to understand.<br/>
&gt; It seems Shu is slowly opening up to you…<br/>
&gt; You feel that your relationship with Shu has deepened.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean it can't have anything to do with how much of a prick he can be. No sir.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Shu.png"/> Oh, time's up. This is a good spot to finish, actually, so let's just end it for today.<br/>
<br/>
<b>11/23/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>We had the day off today, somewhat spoiled by this damn fog. I saw Hisano, so I decided to bring her those letters.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Hisano.png"/> Souji-chan, those…<br/>
&gt; Hisano is surprised about something.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Hisano.png"/> …Yes, I would like to talk.<br/>
&gt; Hisano seems to have regained her composure…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Hisano.png"/> Those are letters I sent to my husband…<br/>
&gt; You told her that you had found these at Daidara as well.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Hisano.png"/> So, he'd been keeing my letters in the storehouse as well…<br/>
Haha… We thought alike.<br/>
I need to throw these away as well.<br/>
…But first, can you let me read them?<br/>
&gt; Hisano began reading a letter…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Hisano.png"/> "We compared our hair; / now it reaches my shoulders. / If not you, then who / will tie it up for me when / it becomes necessary?<br/>
"The path you left on this has long been buried by fallen leaves.<br/>
"Will I be able to meet you again when the cherry blossoms bloom and the cicadas buzz?<br/>
"Each day grows brighter. I can feel you coming closer, step by step."<br/>
……<br/>
<br/>
<i>Hisano is still convinced that she's Death.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hisano began reading the next letter…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Hisano.png"/> "That poem you sent me was from the Ise, wasn't it? It's fitting, as I'm waiting here for you.<br/>
"But I wish I could just spring away from here and run to your arms.<br/>
"It would be an adventure to search for the 'Cowrie of the Swallows' in order to win your heart.<br/>
"If I could transform my heart into the wind and make it rush to your side, would you take it into your hand?"<br/>
……<br/>
…I loved him this much…<br/>
And because I loved him, it saddened me that he forgot my love.<br/>
I was miserable and jealous…<br/>
I was a fool…<br/>
I was left behind because I was such a fool…<br/>
He… He was all that I had…<br/>
Now, he's gone…<br/>
I must accept that…<br/>
<br/>
<i>But as long as you're alive, you have to keep living.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00104.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Hisano.png"/> You're right… But can I do it…?<br/>
&gt; Hisano smiles through her tears.<br/>
&gt; You feel that you've touched Hisano's heart…<br/>
<br/>
<i>There's always time, no matter how late it is.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00108.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Hisano.png"/> Thank you…<br/>
If it's okay with you… I'd like to see you again.<br/>
&gt; You left Hisano and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<b>11/24/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>If this fog goes on much longer there could start to be some serious problems.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00112.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Chatty Girl:</b> I can't even see the sky with all this fog… I really don't like this weather.<br/>
<b>Braided Girl:</b> Huh, why? I'm fine with it.<br/>
Some people say the fog is poisonous, but I don't feel bad at all. You're worrying too much.<br/>
Just imagine that the town was supposed to be like this form the very beginning. Pretend that this is natural!<br/>
<b>Chatty Girl:</b> If you say so…<br/>
…More students are calling in sick lately, but I guess it's nothing really unusual.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's even spreading to some of the teachers.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00119.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mrs. Nakayama:</b> The fog doesn't seem to be lifting, either… Don't you feel drained on foggy days?<br/>
The bad news is that I can't go home yet, though. That's the crushing reality of a full-time employee.<br/>
So, back to the lecture… Math and civilization evolved simultaneously, which allowed us to solve problems…<br/>
Although, there are some math problems that have yet to be solved. They're called "millennium prize problems."<br/>
In the year 2000, they announced seven unsolved problems. If you solved one, you were awarded with 1,000,000 dollars.<br/>
Hmm, Seta-kun.<br/>
How many millennium prize problems do you think remain unsolved?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I remembered a big to-do when one of these got solved.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00127.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mrs. Nakayama:</b> Ahh, I'm surprised you knew. But yes, one of them has been solved.<br/>
I envy whoever solved it… He walked away with the money. And so you know, he solved the Poincare conjecture.<br/>
They even tried to award him the Fields Medal, which is kinda like the Nobel Prize, but he declined it.<br/>
I guess geniuses don't think along the same lines as us normal people. *sigh *<br/>
…Sorry that I'm getting off topic, but my husband is acting weird lately.<br/>
Not that we've been fighting… But he's been going on about how the fog is poisonous…<br/>
Ugh, I'm so depressed. Let's just continue the lecture…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Rise was worried about Nanako, so we got the gang together to head to the hospital again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00135.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Rise.png"/> We saved Nanako-chan… right…?<br/>
…Oh, I'm sorry. Umm… Are you going to visit her today?<br/>
Okay! I'm sure Nanako-chan'll be happy!<br/>
<br/>
<i>I kind of feel bad that we're waking her up, though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Nanako.png"/> ……<br/>
&gt; Nanako seems to have noticed your presence and woke up…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Souji.png"/> You can go back to sleep.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Nanako.png"/> Mm…<br/>
&gt; Nanako is smiling weakly…<br/>
&gt; Nanako's condition doesn't seem like it's getting any better…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Rise.png"/> Nanako-chan…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Teddie2.png"/> ……<br/>
&gt; Your friends are as worried about her as they would be about themselves…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Nanako, and this damn fog… It seems like we've got more to worry about after catching Namatame, not less.</i>
