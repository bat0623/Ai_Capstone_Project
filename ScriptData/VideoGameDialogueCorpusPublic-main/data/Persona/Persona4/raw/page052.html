<i>I trained with Chie a bit today, not much happened. Things got much more… eventful when I got home.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Nanako.png"/> Oh, welcome back!<br/>
Um, Dad…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Dojima.png"/> Later, Nanako…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Nanako.png"/> B-But, this paper…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Dojima.png"/> "Scheduling of Parent-Teacher Interviews"?<br/>
A survey, huh…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Nanako.png"/> ……<br/>
Fine.<br/>
It's fine…<br/>
It's fine already!<br/>
You don't have to write anything! You don't have to come!<br/>
It's just another case to you, right? It's more work, isn't it?<br/>
Bad people and everyone else are more important to you than me, huh!?<br/>
You're not "real"…<br/>
You're not my "real" Dad!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Neither of us could even move as Nanako ran out the door.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Dojima.png"/> What's gotten into her…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Souji.png"/> Let's go look for her.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Dojima.png"/> Yeah… Yeah, you're right. Now's not the time to stand around asking questions.<br/>
&gt; Dojima nods strongly.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Dojima.png"/> I'll go check Junes. Souji, you look around the shopping district!<br/>
I'm counting on you!<br/>
&gt; You need to find Nanako…<br/>
<br/>
<i>The shopping district was empty, of course.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You didn't see Nanako…<br/>
<b>Man's Voice:</b> Hey, Souji!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> I ran into Dojima-san at Junes, and he told me what happened.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> You coulda just asked!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yukiko.png"/> We got a call from Yosuke-kun.<br/>
I'm sure if we all look, we'll find her.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Hey, do you know what kinda places she might've gone?<br/>
&gt; A place where Nanako would go…<br/>
&gt; You recall that Nanako said her family used to go to the Samegawa River when her mother was still alive…<br/>
&gt; You told your friends about that…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> The river, huh…?<br/>
Alright, Souji, you head straight there. That's our best bet.<br/>
The rest of us'll split up and look around. If anyone finds anything, give the others a ring, okay?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dojima had the same thought it turned out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Dojima.png"/> Dammit… Where is she…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>She was sitting alone on a bench.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Dojima.png"/> ……<br/>
Could you… talk to her?<br/>
I'm not her "real father," huh…?<br/>
Souji… You should go pick her up.<br/>
She'll listen to you…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Souji.png"/> Okay.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Dojima.png"/> …Sorry about this.<br/>
As long as Nanako is okay… I'm fine.<br/>
…Please.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think he was afraid she'd run again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Souji.png"/> Let's go home.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Nanako.png"/> …Yeah.<br/>
&gt; Nanako looks like she's about to cry.<br/>
&gt; You told Nanako that her father was the one who found her…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Nanako.png"/> ……<br/>
He was looking for me…?<br/>
Did Dad say anything about the river?<br/>
Did he forget about Mom…?<br/>
He never talks about her…<br/>
I wanna see Mom…<br/>
&gt; Nanako is struggling not to cry…<br/>
&gt; Through Nanako's fierce resolve, you feel that your relationship with her has grown deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't think that's Dojima's problem, though…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Nanako.png"/> Dad must've forgotten Mom.<br/>
There aren't any pictures of her at home. He probably threw them all away…<br/>
Is he going to throw me away, too…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Souji.png"/> He hasn't forgotten.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Nanako.png"/> …I'm going home.<br/>
Let's go home together.<br/>
&gt; You called your friends and told them that Nanako was safe…<br/>
&gt; You returned home with Nanako.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Ughh. Tomorrow is the last day of break. Almost back to school.</i><br/>

<br/>
<i>Dojima had the perfect way to end the summer.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Nanako.png"/> Um, I got a call from Dad… He said someone gave him a watermelon.<br/>
It's too big for us to eat, so he said you should call your friends over.<br/>
Do you think Teddie and your other friends can come?<br/>
&gt; Nanako seems to want everyone to come…<br/>
&gt; You decide to give them a call.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Watermelon?<br/>
Whoa, definitely! I haven't had any yet this year.<br/>
I'm gonna call up the others, so you better not smack it open before we get there!<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's almost hard to cram everyone in here.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00095.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Nanako may well have been a factor in their decision as well…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Nanako.png"/> Um, Dad got a watermelon from someone, so he said we should call everyone.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Kanji.png"/> Man, a watermelon!<br/>
'Cause of all the stuff that's gone down this summer, I completely missed out.<br/>
So where is it? The fridge?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Rise.png"/> Gee, Kanji. They invited us over… At least show some manners.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> We gotta smack it open first.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> Huh? Are we seriously gonna do that? We can't eat it if it gets all crushed.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yukiko.png"/> But, but, doesn't it sound like fun?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Nanako.png"/> I wanna do it too!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Teddie2.png"/> I'll swing at it with everything I've got!<br/>
The splattering fruit juice! Bursts of joy! One night of live… The bitter sweetness of those days is the essence of youth!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> That makes no sense at all…<br/>
And dude, will you cut out those commercial lines of yours!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Nanako.png"/> That's the essence of youth!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Dojima.png"/> I'm home-whoa, that's a lot of shoes. How many people are here?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Nanako.png"/> Welcome home!<br/>
Um, let's split the watermelon open!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Dojima.png"/> Say what!? …Uh, well, you see…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Turns out Dojima had already cut the watermelon so he could share it with the neighbors.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00116.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Dojima.png"/> …I'm really sorry.<br/>
It never occurred to me that you'd want to do that…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> Hey, Nanako-chan. Let's do it again sometime.<br/>
Next time, we'll do it right-at the beach!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Rise.png"/> Seconded!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Yosuke.png"/> Whoa… Does that mean we get to see you guys in swimsuits!?<br/>
Oh… but there probably aren't enough days left. We'll have to do it next year…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Nanako.png"/> Next year…<br/>
Will you play with me next year too?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> Of course we will!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Kanji.png"/> You betcha!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Yukiko.png"/> You betcha!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Dojima.png"/> Did you hear that, Nanako?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Nanako.png"/> Yep! Thank you!<br/>
&gt; The fun time slowly passes by…<br/>
&gt; Eventually, everyone went home.<br/>
&gt; Nanako must have gotten tired too. She already seems to be asleep in her room…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Dojima had something to say I think, but he couldn't get it out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00134.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Dojima.png"/> It's been a while since I last saw Nanako in high spirits like that.<br/>
……<br/>
The case is finally solved… Now for all the-<br/>
……<br/>
Eh, never mind. Save it for some other time.<br/>
You know… you really made some great friends.<br/>
&gt; The sun set peacefully…<br/>
<br/>
<i>School starts tomorrow. It's going to be a boring term without the murders hanging over everything.</i>
