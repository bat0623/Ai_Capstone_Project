<i>Kanji came over today, he had some kind of plan.</i><br/>

<br/>
&gt; You brought Kanji here at his insistence…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> Sorry for bargin' in like this… I thought it'd be a good place…<br/>
Oh, first though…<br/>
There's one more thing I figured out.<br/>
Rise stopped by our store the other day…<br/>
She said the dolls were cute, so I told her I made 'em.<br/>
Then she said that was creepy…<br/>
It kinda stung, but I kept on showing her the other stuff I made…<br/>
And in the end, she said, "Maybe you're an amazing guy after all."<br/>
It pissed me off the way she said it, but that aside…<br/>
I get it now… This is what he was talking about…<br/>
I've just been throwin' in the towel all this time.<br/>
Of course no one could understand me… I been keepin' my distance outta fear.<br/>
So I decided that I'd do things my way, no matter how tough, but…<br/>
It ain't just hanging out with guys who understand you and telling the rest to get bent…<br/>
You gotta make an effort if you want people to understand you. I wasn't even trying.<br/>
Not just about my hobby. But like, when the police suspected me…<br/>
It didn't even cross my mind to try to tell 'em my story. I let 'em think whatever they want.<br/>
And because of that, you, Ma, and that kid all got dragged into it.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kanji finally I think gets what his problems really were.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> It's easier for me to act tough…<br/>
&gt; Kanji is smiling wryly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> So from now on I got two rules: Rule one! Be myself. Rule two! Get people to understand me.<br/>
I want you to have this, Senpai.<br/>
&gt; You obtained Cute Strap.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> This thing's me being me.<br/>
Now I can say it straight out… That "other me" is me.<br/>
<br/>
<i>And just like Yosuke, Yukiko, and Chie, Kanji gained new strength from this.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-P4-00031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Now his persona is some flaming moustache demon or something. Don't ask me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Take-Mikazuchi has transfigured into Rokuten Maoh!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> This… For reals…!?<br/>
I get it… So I've become a little "stronger," huh…?<br/>
You're my hero, dude… And my best bud!<br/>
&gt; You can sense Kanji's straightforward feelings…<br/>
&gt; You feel a tight bond between you and Kanji…<br/>
<br/>
<i>But it does seem like he's happy now.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>And of course vast supernatural power or something.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Kanji.png"/> So, as far as getting' other people to understand me…<br/>
Today I'm holding the "Oven Mitt Puppets 101" class, right here!<br/>
Don't worry, even you can do it! It'll be reeeal cute!<br/>
Believe me!<br/>
&gt; You spent more time than you planned with Kanji…<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; It has gotten dark, so you said goodbye to Kanji…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I don't know what I'm going to do with all these oven mitt puppets, I guess if I get bored I can practice my ventriloquism or something.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>It looks like it's going to start raining tomorrow.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Lazy Student:</b> Wow, look at those clouds.<br/>
I heard the weather's going to get worse starting tomorrow.<br/>
<b>Depressed Girl:</b> Don't tell me the fog's going to come back… Gimme a break…<br/>
One of these days, I'm going to get hurt in the dark on my way home from cram school!<br/>
<b>Lazy Student:</b> Why don't I start walking you home tomorrow, Senpai?<br/>
<br/>
<i>And I think it's always raining for Mrs. Nakayama.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mrs. Nakayama:</b> Soon as you discover something's wrong, the sorrow's just gonna stick with you. …Really, don't rush into marriage…<br/>
Not that young people like you would understand until after you've made the mistake…<br/>
Hey, Hanamura-kun! Are you mocking me!?<br/>
Marriage is a big chunk out of your life! In the old days, people used to have to put deposits on it!<br/>
So, tell me, Hanamura-kun! What's the origin of the word "wedding"!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yosuke.png"/> Whoa, relax… Students have it pretty hard too…<br/>
…Wait. What did she just ask me? The origin of the word "wedding"…?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I only knew this because I'd thumbed through Nakayama's copy of Bitter Wives Quarterly when she was out once.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mrs. Nakayama:</b> That's right. A gamble. Did you hear me? It's a GAMBLE!!<br/>
If only I'd known… I wouldn't be in this mess now. Don't make the same mistake I did, people!<br/>
…I'll put it on the test so it gets hammered into your heads, okay?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Yosuke.png"/> Man, she's on another one of her rants… Thanks for bailing me out, Souji.<br/>
…And sorry for not paying attention.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Naoto came by at lunch.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Naoto.png"/> Um… Can you spare some time for me later today?<br/>
&gt; Naoto seems rather embarrassed.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Naoto.png"/> *chuckle * I'm glad to hear that.<br/>
……<br/>
Umm, I want to go to your room.<br/>
G-Goodbye!<br/>
&gt; Naoto will be coming to your house after school…<br/>
<br/>
<i>The only girl that's ever been in here up to now has been Nanako.</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Naoto.png"/> I see… So this is where you live.<br/>
I can see furnishings here and there that don't match your tastes…<br/>
…These are temporary lodgings, of course.<br/>
Judging by the position of your TV, you regularly watch the Midnight Channel from…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Souji.png"/> Is it that interesting?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Naoto.png"/> Well, of course. This is your room.<br/>
Oh, e-err… well…<br/>
&gt; Naoto is blushing…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Naoto.png"/> Er, anyway… I'm sorry for intruding like this…<br/>
I-I… wanted to give you something…<br/>
I… err, made this.<br/>
Please accept it.<br/>
&gt; You obtained Detective Badge.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Naoto makes some really great stuff.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00096.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Naoto.png"/> If I went back to the estate, I could have added a camera and transceiver…<br/>
Oh, but it flashes! I made myself one to match.<br/>
……<br/>
Don't laugh… or say it's stupid or childish… okay?<br/>
The title of "detective" became a burden to me…<br/>
I thought I had no other aspects apart from my detective self.<br/>
But you gave me a reason to be, as neither adult nor man…<br/>
Souji-san… Being with you…<br/>
I felt I was glad to be a detective…<br/>
And…<br/>
……<br/>
D-Do you find the pitch of my voice strange?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I kind of like it when she stops trying to make her voice deeper, honestly.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00109.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Naoto.png"/> I-I see…<br/>
Umm… I-I'll try…<br/>
How's this…?<br/>
…Hmhm, it's rather embarrassing.<br/>
But I never thought I'd get used to sounding like that. People change, I suppose…<br/>
I think I'll grow to like myself…<br/>
&gt; Naoto is smiling gently…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Anyway Naoto also found a new power inside herself.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00118.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I actually do know this one, Yamato Takeru is a famous prince.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00119.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Sukuna-Hikona has transfigured into Yamato Takeru!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Naoto.png"/> This potential… was still dormant within me…<br/>
I wasn't considering the things that I should have. The people who care about me, as well as my own self…<br/>
The detective, the child, the woman… The "me" who existed before them…<br/>
I am… simply myself.<br/>
I'm glad to have met you…<br/>
&gt; You can sense Naoto's passionate love…<br/>
&gt; You feel a tight bond between you and Naoto…<br/>
<br/>
<i>You know I need to figure out where this mysterious voice is coming from.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00128.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Because it's really sort of intrusive sometimes.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00129.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>And I wasn't overmuch caring about crazy supernatural powers or whatever.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00135.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Naoto.png"/> ……<br/>
Ummm…<br/>
I'm not sure how to put it…<br/>
The puzzle of my emotions has been solved already, but…<br/>
……<br/>
I love you.<br/>
……<br/>
&gt; You passed a long while with Naoto.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; It has gotten dark, so you walked Naoto to her house…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Oh, um, changing the subject I went out tutoring again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00149.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Shu's Mother:</b> I bought it from an online shop that's all the rage these days. It's been the top-ranked store for 15 weeks straight.<br/>
Just like Shu-chan! First place in everything!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Shu.png"/> …Stop it!<br/>
<b>Shu's Mother:</b> But you're my pride and joy…<br/>
So, Souji-kun, about Shu…<br/>
Do you think he could make it into Tokyo University?<br/>
I don't have him to ever have to have any hardship. Once he's in a good college, he's "set," right?<br/>
Everyone has a natural talent. Shu-chan's just happens to be how smart he is!<br/>
I just want him to go to a good college so he can get a good job, then buy a good house and find a good-<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Shu.png"/> Mom!<br/>
Don't worry about me, Mom.<br/>
I'm always on top. I am right now, and I always will be.<br/>
<b>Shu's Mother:</b> That's right! He really is the perfect child…<br/>
&gt; Shu's mother continues to lavish praise on her son…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Shu.png"/> ……<br/>
…If I get into a good college… Am I really "set"?<br/>
<br/>
<i>His mother had left the room by then, so I decided to give my honest opinion on the subject.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00166.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Shu.png"/> …How would you know? You're not even in college yet!<br/>
&gt; Shu sneers at you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Shu.png"/> I don't really need to be "set" just yet. I don't really know what that's supposed to mean, anyway.<br/>
…Well, I need to study. There's no point asking about college unless I'm really smart.<br/>
……<br/>
&gt; Shu is looking down…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Shu.png"/> "Raison d'etre."<br/>
…Do you know what that means?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Mr. Morooka would be cursing me from the afterlife if I messed this up.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00176.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Shu.png"/> …I'm surprised. Well, it makes sense, since you're three grades above me.<br/>
&gt; Shu nods.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Shu.png"/> …It's irrelevant.<br/>
……<br/>
I only have Mom, and the guys at school are all kids…<br/>
……<br/>
&gt; It seems that Shu has opened his heart to you, if only a little…<br/>
&gt; You feel that your relationship with Shu has deepened slightly.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I think Shu is going to be disappointed at how little it matters that he's very smart in a lot of situations.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-P4-00185.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Shu.png"/> Huh… Time's already up. We were still in the middle of that last question…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Souji.png"/> Wait until next time.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Shu.png"/> …I see. Well, until then.<br/>
&gt; You finished your tutoring job and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Hopefully he figures it out in time.</i><br/>
