			<b>9/3/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>I ran into that weird girl who wrote the ema request the fox gave me before the summer break started on the roof again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Her words are harsh…<br/>
&gt; But you dealt with the cold response well, due to your Understanding!<br/>
<b>Awkward Girl:</b> Wh-What…?<br/>
Normal people would have left by now, yelling something at me.<br/>
…You're weird.<br/>
……<br/>
Wh-What are you standing there for? Say something to me, you got that!?<br/>
&gt; The awkward girl ran away.<br/>
<br/>
<i>If she's going to keep running off like that I'm not sure how this is going to work. Anyway, I decided to help out at the daycare center.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Man:</b> Akio, we're going home!<br/>
<b>Yuuta:</b> …When is he coming back?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Eri.png"/> Hmm? You mean your father…?<br/>
Hmmmm… I don't know yet.<br/>
<b>Yuuta:</b> …I'm going home with Ryu-kun.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Eri.png"/> *sigh *<br/>
I guess he wants to see his father.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> I don't know.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Eri.png"/> He hasn't said anything to you about it?<br/>
I'm just a stranger who barged into his life six months ago, so… I feel a bit sorry for him.<br/>
&gt; Eri is smiling wryly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Eri.png"/> My husband kind of set me up…<br/>
He only told me he had a child right before we got married…<br/>
…But I thought he was the one for me, so I figured the three of us would be able to work it all out.<br/>
Then, right after we got married, he was sent to China on business.<br/>
He keeps in contact with me, but… It doesn't change the fact that he's not here.<br/>
*sigh * He's so inconsiderate…<br/>
<br/>
<i>That has to be a really hard situation.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-P4-00038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Eri.png"/> Huh…? I don't know…<br/>
When I married him, I thought he was the one… But I'm not so sure anymore.<br/>
Even so… That's no reason to get a divorce, right…?<br/>
&gt; Eri sounds pretty emotionally detached from the situation…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Eri.png"/> Maybe I rushed into marriage too quickly…<br/>
When he told me I wouldn't have to work, I thought it'd be a good idea, but…<br/>
Oh! Don't tell my husband, okay?<br/>
&gt; Eri is smiling… But you can't tell if it's genuine.<br/>
&gt; You feel like you understand Eri a bit more…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I really don't get her at all though.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Eri.png"/> I wonder if Yuuta's home by now… I'd better be going now, too.<br/>
&gt; You finished your job and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Not much else to say.</i><br/>
<br/>
<b>9/4/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie and I trained a bit today, then stopped by at Aiya.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You finished today's training and decided to stop by with Chie…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> Today is steak bowl day! Just you wait!<br/>
<b>Kid's Voice:</b> I-I don't have any more…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> D-Don't tell me they're at it again!?<br/>
Let's go, Souji-kun!<br/>
<br/>
<i>This time the punks were picking on a little kid.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Punk:</b> Huh? Aw, not her again.<br/>
<b>Punk Leader:</b> Heheh, I know how to handle this bitch.<br/>
<b>Punk:</b> Huhuhuh! You look like you got something planned!<br/>
<b>Crying Kid:</b> H-Help…<br/>
<b>Punk Leader:</b> Hear that, "Chie-chan"? He wants help.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> How do you know my name…?<br/>
<b>Punk Leader:</b> We ran into the guy you saved last time… Had a friendly conversation.<br/>
He told us all kinda stuff. Like where you live, and about that precious "Yukiko-san" of yours.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Takeshi better not even dream of entering my sight again, that's for DAMN sure.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Punk Leader:</b> Oh, I'm just gonna have a little chat with this kid. Stay put, okay?<br/>
'Cause who knows what'll happen to "Yukiko-san" if you get in our way…?<br/>
<b>Punk:</b> Huhuhuh! Man, that's nasty!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> Why, you…!!<br/>
<b>Crying Kid:</b> *sniff *<br/>
&gt; Things aren't looking good…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Hell with these punks.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00077.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> Yeah… We can't let these guys get away!<br/>
&gt; Chie is spitting mad…<br/>
<b>Punk Leader:</b> You sure about that? So you don't care what happens to your best friend?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> Rrrgh… Fine, then hit me!<br/>
You're pissed at me, right!? Then why don't you just take a swing at me?<br/>
I won't fight back. Be my guest!<br/>
The face, the gut, just pick a target! As hard as you want!<br/>
C'mon!!<br/>
<b>Punk Leader:</b> …Freak.<br/>
<b>Punk:</b> What's with this bitch… She for real? Whatever, man… Let's go…<br/>
<b>Crying Kid:</b> M-Miss… Thank you…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> ……<br/>
Huh? Oh, no, don't worry about it!<br/>
&gt; The child ran off…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie was amazing, I have to say.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-P4-00092.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> …Was that stupid of me?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> You protected that kid.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> …Thanks.<br/>
&gt; It seems Chie is embarrassed…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> It might've been stupid, but I wanted to save them…<br/>
That kid, Yukiko…<br/>
I know that feeling wasn't fake. I really wanted to protect them…<br/>
&gt; Chie is smiling gently…<br/>
&gt; You feel you relationship with Chie has grown yet deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>And she's trying her hardest.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00102.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> ……<br/>
Um, well…<br/>
I also want to protect you…<br/>
I might be a little flaky… And maybe you don't even need protecting…<br/>
But… I…<br/>
I want to protect you…<br/>
……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> I'm counting on you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> …Yep. You can depend on me!<br/>
So, let's get some steak!<br/>
&gt; You ate with Chie and went home together.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Steak does taste better after victory I have to say. Oh, and Nanako went shopping earlier.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00123.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You have the ingredients to make carrot and burdock root kinpira.<br/>
&gt; You decided to make kinpira.<br/>
&gt; ……<br/>
&gt; You finished stir-frying the roots and carrots…<br/>
&gt; How should you give it a flavor?<br/>
<br/>
<i>This one was a real no-brainer.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-P4-00129.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You smell an aromatic scent from it.<br/>
&gt; Obtained Appetizing Kinpira.<br/>
<br/>
<b>9/5/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>We're not the only people still thinking about the murders.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-P4-00133.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Dark-Haired Girl:</b> You know, I don't really see the police in town anymore.<br/>
I've seen on the news that there are still some loose ends to this case, but the police are ready to end everything.<br/>
<b>Athletic Girl:</b> The what…? You mean those murders? Why're you still thinking about stuff from that far back?<br/>
Ignore that! The school trip starts on Thursday. Both the first and second years are going!<br/>
I might end up in the same group as Risette!<br/>
I'm so looking forward to it!<br/>
<b>Dark-Haired Girl:</b> Sheesh, you never even cared about idols until now…<br/>
<br/>
<i>The people of Inaba seem kind of freaked out by all the strangeness.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Hosoi:</b> After the murder incidents, an idol comes to town, and then a detective shows up too…?<br/>
This town used to be so carefree. Every year was more of the same until this year came along…<br/>
Anyway, I'm supposed to cover haiku today. Get out your textbooks.<br/>
Haiku, unlike senryu, contain "kigo," which are words or phrases that can be associated with a particular season.<br/>
Alright, why don't I test the waters with a kigo-related question. Souji-chan!<br/>
Which of the following isn't a kigo for spring?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Even if I didn't know this it's logical.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00148.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Hosoi:</b> Wow, I'm impressed, Souji-chan! You're correct!<br/>
"Sardine" is a kigo for autumn. You're all familiar with what it is, right? You know, like anchovies?<br/>
But we use sardines for fish oil, animal feed, and fertilizer too. It's a very versatile fish.<br/>
Oops, I got off-topic. Let's continue the lecture.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie eats so much steak, I figured she should eat something else for once.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00157.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You ate lunch with Chie.<br/>
&gt; You ate Appetizing Kinpira together.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> It's delicious! I've never eaten anything that tastes this good before!<br/>
I want more, but… I don't wanna finish it all!<br/>
What a dilemma…!<br/>
Umm… Did you make this for me?<br/>
Th-Thank you…<br/>
&gt; Chie enjoyed your lunch!<br/>
<br/>
<i>That girl from the request was back once again, and looked sort of apologetic.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00166.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Awkward Girl:</b> W-Well? I'm busy, so wh-what's on your mind!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> Do you need help speaking?<br/>
<b>Awkward Girl:</b> Wha…! Wh-Where'd you hear that!?<br/>
…Oh.<br/>
I-It's not like I'm worried about it! L-Leave me alone!<br/>
&gt; She's quite worried about her speech and defensive about it, as well…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I figured I'd offer to help her out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00173.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You offer to teach her.<br/>
<b>Awkward Girl:</b> C-Conversation lessons!?<br/>
I-I don't need them! Leave me alone!<br/>
……<br/>
But if you really want to teach someone, then maybe I'll listen to you for a while, just to be nice.<br/>
&gt; You gave her some tips on how to converse with other people.<br/>
<b>Awkward Girl:</b> Y-You should've told me this earlier!<br/>
Oh… um… That's not right.<br/>
"It would have been most desirable if you would have imparted this wisdom at a much earlier occasion."<br/>
…Like that?<br/>
Um…<br/>
Th-Thank you.<br/>
……<br/>
I hope… you can teach me again sometime.<br/>
B-Bye!<br/>
&gt; The awkward girl ran away.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I ran into Chie, she seemed like she had something to tell me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00192.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You trained with Chie like always.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> Okay! I think that's enough for today!<br/>
&gt; Chie seems more enthusiastic than usual today.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> Yeah… I feel like I haven't been that on-form in a while!<br/>
Hey, uh… there's something I want to tell you. Something I've been thinking about all this time.<br/>
…I still don't have a clue what my good points are.<br/>
But… I thought I could just keep on searching.<br/>
I'm going to fight alongside you 'til the very end.<br/>
I mean… we'll always be friends!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Souji.png"/> Of course.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> Yeah!<br/>
&gt; Chie is smiling gently.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> From me to you.<br/>
&gt; You obtained Wristbands.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> Oh, and it's new, so it's clean!<br/>
It makes a matching pair with mine. Hahaha…<br/>
…I think this "power" of mine is what I wanted all along.<br/>
The power to protect everyone…<br/>
I understand now. I'm not supposed to use it to become more self-reliant…<br/>
I'm supposed to use this power to protect people… Yukiko, my friends, my family, this town… and you.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chie's Persona changed like Yosuke's and Yukiko's.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-P4-00213.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>It became Suzuka Gongen, who is some kind of guardian entity. Damn thing was terrifying, I'll give it that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-P4-00214.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Tomoe has transfigured into Suzuka Gongen!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> My… new power…<br/>
…I have you to thank for this.<br/>
No matter how far apart we may be in the future, we'll be okay.<br/>
This feeling won't ever change…<br/>
&gt; You can sense Chie's strong resolve.<br/>
&gt; You feel a tight bond between you and Chie…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I've gotten quite a lot of these 'finished' now. I guess that means I'm making some real friends.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-P4-00222.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>I also got the ability to create someone called Futsunushi, a spirit of swords.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-P4-00223.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chie.png"/> Alright then, my body and mind are all worn out! Let's go get some meat, and I mean the good stuff!<br/>
&gt; You went on a meat-eater's tour of Inaba with Chie…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Even now I'm not sure I can move from all that steak. I'm not sure how Chie does it.</i>
