			<b>11/25/11</b><br/><br/>
<i>Only a few days until exams start, and this damned fog seems like it's here to stay at this rate.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-P4-00001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Hosoi:</b> Anyway, what is wrong with this weather? The whole town looks like a polluted factory exploded.<br/>
But don't even think about calling in sick or skipping your studies. I'll be able to tell if you were really sick.<br/>
And that goes double for anyone who failed the last exams!<br/>
The eleventh hour is upon you, people. The next test determines whether or not you can go to the next grade.<br/>
…Hm, Souji-chan. I've got a question for you.<br/>
What does it mean when you're in the "eleventh hour"?<br/>
<br/>
<i>This one was easy as cake, and other clichés.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-P4-00008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Hosoi:</b> Wow! Right, right! It's your last chance!<br/>
I'm gonna put this question on next week's test.<br/>
I wish you all luck on moving on to the next grade! Study hard!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Rise wanted to talk to me about something, so we headed up to the hill that overlooks town.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-P4-00014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Fog has enveloped the area…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Rise.png"/> Senpai… I thought about it.<br/>
Why my mind just went blank when I heard about Kanami…<br/>
I mean, I ran away form showbiz because I was tired of being an idol…<br/>
So I shouldn't have any problems…<br/>
And yet… I felt so angry about it… Why do you think that is…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Souji.png"/> 'Risette' is Rise, too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Rise.png"/> Yeah… You knew all along, huh…?<br/>
Haha, but really… that's how it was.<br/>
Risette's name in lights… Idolized by the masses…<br/>
That was "me," too…<br/>
I didn't want to lose that "me"…<br/>
&gt; Rise is smiling sheepishly…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Rise.png"/> There's no way to become someone else…<br/>
I ran away from my plain, gloomy self… Then I ran away from my idol self…<br/>
Right now I'm the homicide detective self, I guess?<br/>
I would've run away from that as well, if I didn't realize…<br/>
I've been trying to become how I wanted to be.<br/>
I pick a role… When I'm through with it, I continue chasing the "real me" by picking another role…<br/>
…When in fact those roles are all "me."<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's funny how hard it can be to realize such a simple thing.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-P4-00035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Rise.png"/> I'm gonna hang in there… as the complete me.<br/>
&gt; Rise spoke her mind, looking straight at you…<br/>
&gt; You feel your relationship with Rise has grown deeper…<br/>
<br/>
<i>But it's the simplest things that can elude us sometimes.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-P4-00039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Rise.png"/> I'm glad I came to this town.<br/>
I'm glad to have met you, and the others too!<br/>
*giggle * Let's go home, Senpai!<br/>
&gt; You walked Rise to her house and went home.<br/>
<br/>
<b>11/26/11</b><br/>
<br/>
<i>The town's really starting to go crazy, I don't know how  much longer this damn fog can last before someone gets hurt.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-P4-00044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Dark-Haired Girl:</b> Hey… Don't you think that there are more and more people getting weird because of the fog?<br/>
I even see people wearing these huge gas masks around town…<br/>
<b>Athletic Girl:</b> Yeah, and people are getting sick, too. Haven't there been people saying a lot of weird stuff lately?<br/>
Like that the world is ending, and that global warming is because of Original Sin, nutty stuff like that…<br/>
<b>Dark-Haired Girl:</b> H-Hey…<br/>
What do you think's going to happen if you think someone's sick, but you don't do anything about it…?<br/>
I mean… To be honest… Yesterday, my dad…<br/>
<br/>
<i>At least Mr. Kondo isn't letting himself get freaked out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-P4-00052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Kondo:</b> Are you exhausted from studying for the test around the corner? I hope you're not forgetting something…<br/>
Christmas is coming up in a month! Have you found your dates yet?<br/>
Hahaha, I've got mine already! Tell ya what! I'll give you guys a Christmas question!<br/>
Get it straight, and you'll get a date! Get it wrong… and it'll be a blue Christmas for you! Souji!<br/>
Which of the following is considered an incorrect way to spell "Christmas"!?<br/>
<br/>
<i>I mean I don't need to rely on Mr. Kondo's grim prophecy for a date thank god.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-P4-00058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Kondo:</b> Wow, excellent! Souji, looks like you'll be decking the halls with a lady this Christmas!<br/>
He's right, the apostrophe isn't necessary for abbreviating Christmas. It's right there in the dictionary.<br/>
But, this is a very common misspelling among Japanese people, so remember this!<br/>
*chuckle * Nothing beats eating cake with a loved one on Christmas! Mmm, mmm, mmm! De-LISH!<br/>
Hahah! I hope you all get a "taste" of what that's like!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Rise suggested that we could go down to Okina for the day and get out of this horrible fog, which was a damned good idea really. I managed to stumble through the fog to Shu's house later.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-P4-00068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Shu.png"/> …Oh, I see. The word "that" was omitted… So it's really saying…<br/>
&gt; You began to explain the sentence to him in an easily-understood manner.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Shu.png"/> …To tell you the truth, I'm not that good with the English language.<br/>
I can memorize what's in the textbook and get good grades on tests, but I don't really understand it…<br/>
But the teacher doesn't comprehend the difference between reading from the textbook and speaking to people.<br/>
Teaching must be a great job. Even idiots can be arrogant when they know more than you do.<br/>
…They don't get what it means to learn at all.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Souji.png"/> That's just how it is.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Shu.png"/> A student's value is equal to how well he scores on tests… Well, at least THAT'S easy to understand.<br/>
&gt; Shu nods.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Shu.png"/> …About the transfer student I told you about before…<br/>
His grades are pretty good… But he can't beat me.<br/>
So then, the rest of the class and the teacher make this face like "the transfer student is no good after all…"<br/>
…Looking down on him…<br/>
And yet, he acts all big, so everyone hates him. Lately, no one even talks to him…<br/>
…It's all so stupid.<br/>
……<br/>
Why do I have to go to school when it's so obviously dumb?<br/>
That place…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kid needs to put himself in the other guy's shoes more often I think.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-P4-00089.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; You scolded Shu.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Shu.png"/> Oh… I see. Everyone goes to school against their will…<br/>
&gt; Shu thinks deeply…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Shu.png"/> …Yasogami High looks fun. At least, I get that feeling when I see you.<br/>
Oh… but by the time I'm a first-year, you'll already have graduated…<br/>
Then there's no point, huh?<br/>
&gt; It seems that Shu is slowly opening up to you…<br/>
&gt; You feel that your relationship with Shu has deepened.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Still, he's not so much of an ass as I'd initially thought.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-P4-00098.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Shu.png"/> Oh, time's up… Be careful going home.<br/>
&gt; You finished your tutoring job and went home.<br/>

<i>It's pretty low to take advantage of people like that. Anyway, Rise wanted to talk to me about something so I met up with her at the hill that overlooks town.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-P4-00123.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Rise.png"/> And the tofu shop is… Oh, there it is. Haha, it's so small…<br/>
I need to remember this scenery…<br/>
Senpai… You're leaving in the spring, right?<br/>
I've made up my mind about something.<br/>
You see…<br/>
……<br/>
I'm thinking of going back into showbiz this spring.<br/>
I am Risette, after all…<br/>
And when I consider it that way, I think I can have more fun working.<br/>
I know how hard it is for a star to make a comeback after an entire year's absence…<br/>
But even then, I want to start over from the beginning.<br/>
Do you remember the fan who gave me that letter? And my old manager, Inoue-san…<br/>
For my family, everyone, you… And for myself.<br/>
&gt; Rise's eyes are shining…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Rise.png"/> Senpai, this…<br/>
I want you to have it, Senpai.<br/>
&gt; You obtained Signed Photo.<br/>
<br/>
<i>It's odd to have such an ordinary picture signed this way, but I like it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-P4-00141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Rise.png"/> But even then, I signed it Risette.<br/>
A Risette without a fake smile…<br/>
Senpai… I won't make the same mistake.<br/>
I won't run away… I won't try to be someone I'm not.<br/>
The many Rise's inside of me… I want to cherish them.<br/>
I quit thinking about such stupid things!<br/>
I mean, in reality, there's no such thing as a real me or a fake me.<br/>
As long as you know what you really want to do, no matter how hard it is, you'll be okay.<br/>
…I can do it!<br/>
<br/>
<i>And Rise's resolve was made manifest.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-P4-00151.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Her Persona became Kanzeon, who represents mercy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-P4-00152.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Himiko has transfigured into Kanzeon!<br/>
&gt; She can now use the skill Affinity Search!<br/>
&gt; During battle, she'll tell you one of the enemy's weak points!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Rise.png"/> This means… my powers have changed…?<br/>
I see… I've become a little stronger.<br/>
Thanks to you… being with me…<br/>
I want to find lots of different "me"s<br/>
And I want to get stronger so instead of running away from them, I'll welcome them with open arms.<br/>
I was relying on you, but… I want to be able to stand on my own two feet.<br/>
Thank you, Senpai!<br/>
I love you!<br/>
&gt; You can sense Rise's pure affection…<br/>
&gt; You feel a tight bond between you and Rise…<br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm just glad she's happy with who she is. All of them.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-P4-00166.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ishtar's a pretty big name goddess of love if I recall my mythology.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-P4-00167.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Rise.png"/> Now that I got that out, I'm hungry!<br/>
Let's go eat somewhere!<br/>
After all, come spring… I won't be able to do that anymore.<br/>
Let's go, Senpai!<br/>
&gt; You dominated the shopping district with Rise and made it to your house…<br/>
<br/>
<i>Ughh, exams start tomorrow. With this fog, and Nanako in the hospital, exams are really the last thing I need.</i><br/>
