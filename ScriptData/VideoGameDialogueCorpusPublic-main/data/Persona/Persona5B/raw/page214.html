	<b>Addendum VI: Downloadable Christfigures</b><br/><br/>
I wanted to get something out today, but I couldn’t figure out exactly what I could post with what I had recorded at the moment.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
So I went and paid 20 Real US Dollars for some bullshit I’ll never use! Let’s show off these DLC Personas! I shouldn’t be allowed to have money!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Let’s head to the Velvet Room and take care of that. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
But first, let’s sit on the toilet and think for a while.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We can get rudimentary explanations of some basic concepts we already understand pretty well. Whatever.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Let’s take a nap while we’re here.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-013.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Five more minutes, Mooooom<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-LavenzaHidden.png"/> ...are…final…leave… If…voice…reached… ...am most…no… Even…must…relay… Please…remember… ...that… by your…own… ...reverse…repel… ...Chosen… ...cruel…save…world…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-ProtagNoGlasses.png"/> <i>I feel like I can hear a voice coming from somewhere…</i><br/>
<br/>
If you lay on the bed, Lavenza will try to send you a message, but it’s all scrambled and useless. It’s fun foreshadowing, though.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Now, let’s get to the meat of this: these DLC Personas. They’re all specially marked, and can each be summoned once for free. All of them also have a unique skill. Downloading these Personas will also make them available via fusion, which is kind of annoying because it’ll mess with the recipes, meaning the Strength Confidant special fusions are trickier to make work. It’s for this reason I didn’t download any (other than Izanagi, which I got for free) until NG+.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Izanagi is the Persona of the Persona 4 protagonist. He is a major creation deity who made many of the islands and deities of Japan along with Izanami. <br/>
<br/>
Izanagi’s unique skill is Cross Slash, which deals Heavy Physical damage 1-2x with high accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
In addition to the default colors, there are also “Picaro” versions of each Persona, which are recolors with better stats and slightly different skills in some cases.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Orpheus is the Persona of the Persona 3 protagonist. Well, the male one. The female protagonist also gets Orpheus, but a female one, somehow. Orpheus was a master lyre player who convinced Hades and Persephone to let him bring back his deceased wife Eurydice, but failed to follow their instructions out of anxiety and lost her forever. <br/>
<br/>
Orpheus’ unique skill is Cadenza, which restores 50% of the party’s HP and increases their evasion rate.<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ariadne is the Persona of Labrys from Persona 4 Arena. I like Labrys a lot, she has an adorable Jersey accent. Anyway, Ariadne was the daughter of King Minos of Crete. She fell in love with Theseus, and gave him the tools to defeat the minotaur within her father’s labyrinth.<br/>
<br/>
Ariadne’s unique skill is Beast Weaver, which deals Colossal Physical damage to a single foe, but causes the user to have their Attack reduced.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-026.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Asterius is the Persona of Shadow Labrys from Persona 4 Arena. It is the minotaur from Minos’ labyrinth, born from Pasiphae due to a curse.<br/>
<br/>
Asterius’ unique skill is Titanomachia, which deals Severe Fire damage to all foes with a high chance of Fear. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-035.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-037.jpg"/><br/>
Thanatos is the <i>other</i> Persona of the Persona 3 protagonist, which developed from having the avatar of Nyx sealed within them. It is the Greek personification of death and mortality, who brings mortals peaceful ends. <br/>
<br/>
Thanatos’ unique skill is Door of Hades, which deals Heavy Almighty to all foes with a medium chance of insta-death.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-040.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Magatsu-Izanagi is the Persona of Tohru Adachi from Persona 4. It is the dark mirror of the protagonist’s Persona. <br/>
<br/>
Magatsu-Izanagi’s unique skill is Magatsu Mandala, which deals Heavy Curse damage to all foes, with a medium chance of Confuse/Fear/Despair.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-044.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Tsukiyomi is the Persona of Sho Minazuki from Persona 4 Arena Uitimax. It is the Shinto god of the moon, born of Izanagi’s right eye. <br/>
<br/>
Tsukiyomi’s unique skill is Abyssal Wings, which deals Severe Curse damage to all foes.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-048.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Kaguya is technically Marie’s Persona, but she doesn’t use it in her debut game, Persona 4 Golden. It has a unique Persona design and is heavily associated with her in that game, being the final Persona of her Arcana. She does eventually use it in her appearance in Persona 4 Arena Ultimax. Marie is a pretty controversial character, but this is honestly one of my very favorite Persona designs, I think it’s cool as hell. Kaguya is a divine, celestial being from a people who lived on the moon. She was found inside a bamboo shoot, and became renowned for her beauty, rejecting all who proposed to her.<br/>
<br/>
Kaguya’s unique skill is Shining Arrows, which deals Light Bless damage to all foes 4-8x.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-052.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Messiah is the ultimate Persona of the Persona 3 protagonist, who is really goddamn overrepresented here, I think. He’s the motherfucking messiah, maybe you’ve heard of him.<br/>
<br/>
Messiah’s unique skill is Oratorio, which fully restores the party’s HP and negates all debuffs.<br/>
<br/>
And that’s all the DLC Personas! I spent like twenty bucks on this update, so you better have enjoyed it!
