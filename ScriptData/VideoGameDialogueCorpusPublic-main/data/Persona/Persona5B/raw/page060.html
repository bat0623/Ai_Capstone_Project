	<b>Part 59: 6/25: Math Is Power</b><br/><br/>
Next on our agenda is navigating this massive repository of vaults. This should also be the last update with interference from Ari, thankfully.<br/>
<br/>
...I also fixed the portraits.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-RyujiGlitch.gif"/> PIN…? So is this gonna open one of the vaults?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> Hm, there’s something written above the number pad on here. “RICH”… This is disgusting. How obsessed can one man be with his money?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-AnnGlitch.gif"/> Wait, there might be something more than that! Do you think this is connected to that journal…?<br/>
<br/>
You know what? This is fine. This is just my life now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-AnnGlitch.gif"/> See? It has all of the letters in the word “RICH”!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> Huh. That might be worth a try. Can you do it, Joker?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-YusukeGlitch.gif"/> We will leave it to you. The Treasure may be beyond here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> If you get confused, just take a look at Kaneshiro’s <b>journal.</b> It’s among our belongings.<br/>
<br/>
This just means “go check your Key Items in case you forget the clue.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> This may be worth trying out. Joker, can you do it?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-006.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
R=C=0, I=1, and H=2, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-008.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Simple. Ari seems to have gotten this remarkably quickly, even if it’s not terribly complex. Good for him, though he didn’t seem to write any commentary about it. ...Weird.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-010.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The vault rotates, placing a gap in front of us.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> So my deduction may be correct...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-KaneshiroShadow2.jpg"/> As long as I’m rich, anything will be possible...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-AnnGlitch.gif"/> That voice… It’s Kaneshiro! Is he watching us!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-MorganaGlitch.gif"/> That doesn’t seem to be the case. It sounds more like the voice of his heart… I guess all he really thinks about is money, after all.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-RyujiGlitch.gif"/> So he blackmails people outta their savings and that’s still not enough? What a douche…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-AnnGlitch.gif"/> More importantly, the message in the journal was the PIN code!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-YusukeGlitch.gif"/> Yes, it seems so… but I doubt it will be that easy from this point forward. The rest of the pages were torn out of the journal. Who knows what clues they may hold...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-MorganaGlitch.gif"/> Well, let’s not get pessimistic. We should look around and try to find some other clues. Time to head further in and find those PINs!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-014.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The only option now is to head further into the vault.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This is Rakshasa. It’s weak to Physical and Bless and loves knocking the shit out of you with Physical strikes.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Along the way, Ryuji gains Bad Beat, a Medium Physical skill that strikes all enemies with a low chance of inflicting Despair. It’s pretty good, because Despair is fucking broken.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Inside this pig, we find a torn page. Sadly, this will not send us to Winnie the Pooh land, but it’s useful nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> Hm? There’s a note here… It says “P=I.”<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-RyujiGlitch.gif"/> ...The hell’s that supposed to mean?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> Wait, the edge of it is torn. Maybe it came from Kaneshiro’s journal?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-MorganaGlitch.gif"/> Oh, so it’s the continuation of the code we found in there! This should be useful!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Further in, we find another one.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> Hm? There’s a note here… It says “E=9 A=3.”<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-YusukeGlitch.gif"/> It seems to be the same as the one we found earlier. The edge here is frayed as well.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-MorganaGlitch.gif"/> Perfect! The more hints we find, the closer we get to solving the code. Come on, let’s hurry over to the input machine!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And here’s the next panel.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-AnnGlitch.gif"/> Reap? Isn’t that like, to harvest? Why would he have that as a password…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-MorganaGlitch.gif"/> That man sees people as walking ATMs… He must think of collecting money from them as a harvest.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-YusukeGlitch.gif"/> Kaneshiro is truly rotten to the core...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-AnnGlitch.gif"/> If this is the same kind of thing as before, the hints should help us find the password, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> We’ll see about that. Why don’t we check the information we have on hand?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-AnnGlitch.gif"/> So we just have to make “REAP” into numbers like before, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> Yes, if we can decode the hints.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
REAP is only slightly more complicated.. We already know R is 0. Adding on top of that, we know E and A are 9 and 3, respectively. Finally, P is equal to I, which was 1. Together, that gives us 0931.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ari solves another one, in no time at all. And he’s still silent. Great!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-025.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-RyujiGlitch.gif"/> All right, it worked!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-KaneshiroShadow2.jpg"/> Don’t gimme your excuses. Just go reap every last penny!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-YusukeGlitch.gif"/> This voice again...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-KaneshiroShadow2.jpg"/> I’ll make you understand if you don’t get it… People who can’t earn money are worthless to me!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-AnnGlitch.gif"/> He’s completely distorted...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> It looks like he really believes money is more important than human life… What a pitiful man.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-RyujiGlitch.gif"/> Yeah… Let’s finish this quick. The door’s prolly opened up, so we should head back and check it out.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-AnnGlitch.gif"/> What do you think, Joker? Should we go straight over to the vault?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-028.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> This is the second one… I wonder how many more there are…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-MorganaGlitch.gif"/> I’m sure we’ll find out as we go. Let’s keep moving to our next one!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-030.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next floor of the vault is covered with impassable gates of electricity.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
To bypass them, we’re forced to climb up and around.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
From there, we can jump across the shelves to proceed.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We use our second (and last) Lockpick on this chest, which contains a new revolver for Makoto.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It’s a rather dramatic improvement.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> This is the same kind of note as before… It says “U=A.”<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-MorganaGlitch.gif"/> It’s just like the other codes we’ve been picking up. I think that’ll be a hint!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-RyujiGlitch.gif"/> Aw yeah, another note. If I’m readin’ it right, it says “G=P.”<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-AnnGlitch.gif"/> OK, we have one more hint than before. Let’s keep it up!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-AnnGlitch.gif"/> It says “HUGE,” you moron! Can you even read?<br/>
<br/>
Don’t make fun of Ryuji’s illiteracy. It’s not nice.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-MorganaGlitch.gif"/> So we’ll need to transpose this one into numbers too. I hope we can do it with the hints we have...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-RyujiGlitch.gif"/> This one’s the third PIN. Uhhh… what’s the word again?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-AnnGlitch.gif"/> Ugh, it’s “HUGE”! As in, you’re a HUGE idiot! Anyway, this can be made into a number too, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> I hope it’s not too difficult.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This one isn’t really any tougher than the last. U=A and G=P means 3 and 1, respectively. H is still 2 and E is still 9, giving us 2319.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...I’ve got a confession to make. It’s not that Ari just mysteriously stopped writing commentary. I know the reason. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I had to piece a lot of it together and ask him and my mother for the rest, but it seems that halfway through doing god-knows-what to my beautiful portraits Ari decided he would try to freak me out as payback for yelling at him. He wanted to replace one of the images with a flashing picture of a T-Rex because he heard I didn’t like Jurassic World very much (though he seems to have misinterpreted and thought I found it scary instead of just tedious). Anyway, during his Google Search he ran across this image:<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Clipboard105.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And now he’s had nightmares for the past few days. He’s just been in no mood to ruin this LP, and probably won’t be again for a good, long while. In light of this, I’ve decided to take the notebook he used to write down various notes about the rest of this update and try to transcribe his thoughts as accurately as I can.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-MorganaGlitch.gif"/> Well then, we should keep--<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>”Hitler-man is weird and pathetic.”</i><br/>
<br/>
On that, we can agree.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-RyujiGlitch.gif"/> What now?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-KaneshiroShadow2.jpg"/> I’m done having other people walk all over me… It’s my turn now…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-YusukeGlitch.gif"/> He is beyond redemption… It seems he cares not for those he tramples upon himself.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> Every step we take just keeps strengthening my resolve. Let’s push onward.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-RyujiGlitch.gif"/> Wanna go back to the vault then?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-044.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> This movement… There can be no doubt.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-YusukeGlitch.gif"/> Hm? Did you notice something?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-AnnGlitch.gif"/> Wh-What do you mean…? Can you explain that a little more…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> The cylinder is the mechanism that judges if a key is the proper shape. If you use the correct key and all the discs align, the lock opens.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-YusukeGlitch.gif"/> Now that you mention it, while the walls rotate, the path forward has remained facing the same way...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-MorganaGlitch.gif"/> So you’re saying the whole floor is just one giant lock…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> That’s right. All the smaller vaults in here aren’t important. There has to be an area further in, locked away by the room itself.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-RyujiGlitch.gif"/> And that’s where the Treasure’s gotta be! Sweet, let’s get goin’!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Up ahead, we run into another boss Shadow.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> Look, behind it!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-MorganaGlitch.gif"/> It seems like we’ll have to take it down to move on… Are you ready for this, Joker?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-050.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Shadow_4.jpg"/> Well, Mr. Kaneshiro ordered me to absolutely not let anyone past this point. Accept your death!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>”He ain’t got no arms!”</i> is what it says here. I assume it’s talking about this, anyway.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This guy is weak to Psi, and accompanied by two Oni, who we should have little trouble dealing with at this point.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-AnnGlitch.gif"/> I guess that’s why the Shadow was protecting it?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> It doesn’t seem to require any keys, but there are buttons on the left and right of the box...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-MorganaGlitch.gif"/> There must be a reason that thing was guarding it. Let’s try and figure out why.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-055.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The vault rotates, revealing… a dead end. So, that’s a bust. Let’s try the left button.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-057.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-058.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The vault rotates once more, placing the gap right next to us. Let’s see what it revealed.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Another panel, of course.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-061.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-062.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This time, the gap is where the dead end was last time.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Pushing the right button again reveals the path forward. Time to head down into yet another vault.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We don’t have a Lockpick for this chest, but we’ll make note of it for later.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We run into a normal version of the Take-Minakata from earlier, though it’s a fair bit above our level, preventing us from being able to acquire it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Morgana learns Diarama, finally catching him up to Makoto in terms of healing output. Media’s pretty much garbage in battle right now due to our much, much larger health pools, so for most tough situations we’ll want both of them.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ryuji also learns Assault Dive, a Heavy Physical strike. Not quite as good as Yusuke’s Rising Slash (especially because Yusuke currently has stat superiority) but enough to catch him up most of the way. <br/>
<br/>
<i>“I wanna be a pirate!”</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-086.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Finally, Makoto learns Energy Shower, an amazingly useful skill that cures Confuse, Fear, Rage, Despair, and Brainwash on the entire party. Considering these are some of the more debilitating status effects, it’s great to have good ways to get rid of them, especially on the entire party. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Another pig, another note.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> This note is a new one. It says “L = U + G, D=G”<br/>
<br/>
Oh… Oh no.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-AnnGlitch.gif"/> Ugh, it’s like, algebra or something! I’m getting confused…<br/>
<br/>
<i>”I don’t… algebra? What?”</i><br/>
<br/>
This is bad. Math isn’t Ari’s strongest subject, and it’s a little early to be introducing him to substituting variables. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-MorganaGlitch.gif"/> Panther… This is really just simple addition...<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, Mona’s right. I’m… I’m sure it’ll be fine.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> Hm, there’s a note here… It says “O+H=10.”<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-MorganaGlitch.gif"/> So we’re getting into calculations now… Good grief. <br/>
<br/>
I’m starting to worry that this game’s rating being Mature is actually because it contains copious amounts of math. Hopefully Ari manages to figure this out.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We have to backtrack a bit and climb up on top of the shelves to access a vent leading us to the keypad this time.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-072.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> I’d expect it’s the same pattern we’ve followed so far. We’ll need to decode that word into numbers.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-YusukeGlitch.gif"/> I believe you’re correct. I only hope we can do so with the hints we currently have on us.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-AnnGlitch.gif"/> The code this time is “GOLD.” Wanna give it a try?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Okay, so U+G = L, so L is 4 (3+1). D is just G, so that’s 1 as well. Finally, O + H = 10, which means that if we subtract H (2) from 10, we get O, which is 8.<br/>
<br/>
Simple enough. Let’s see how Ari did from his notes.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Clipboard01.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh jeez.<br/>

<br/>
The last vault moves aside and an elevator pops out of the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-078.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-YusukeGlitch.gif"/> Again?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-KaneshiroShadow2.jpg"/> This… This is the fruit of all my hard labor!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-RyujiGlitch.gif"/> He thinks robbin’ people is something to celebrate? That guy needs to get his brain checked...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-KaneshiroShadow2.jpg"/> With this much, I will be invincible! Omnipotent! I’ve changed… I’m no longer the person I used to be…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-AnnGlitch.gif"/> The person he used to be…? What could have happened to make him so distorted…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-MorganaGlitch.gif"/> I don’t know, but no matter what kind of past he had, his actions are unforgivable.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> That’s right. Now, if my deductions are accurate, that should’ve been the final mechanism.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-MorganaGlitch.gif"/> All right then. Let’s head back and check out the vault! We know where it is, so going back should be easy. What do you think, Joker?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-080.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-081.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-RyujiGlitch.gif"/> You’re like some kinda prophet, Queen...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> It’s mostly thanks to that notebook. We wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for that. More importantly, did you hear all those things Shadow Kaneshiro was saying?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-AnnGlitch.gif"/> Oh yeah, I was wondering about that! Didn’t he seem kinda… insecure or something?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> Exactly. He kept bringing up how rich and powerful he wants to be.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-RyujiGlitch.gif"/> So if he’s insecure about that shit… he thinks he’s really just some poor weakling, huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> Maybe by thinking he was going to be a strong, wealthy man, he convinced himself it was true.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-YusukeGlitch.gif"/> I wonder… Well, we will discover the truth for ourselves when we change his heart. Let us hurry, Joker.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-082.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-083.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> I don’t see anything.<br/>
<br/>
Doesn’t look like anything to me.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-RyujiGlitch.gif"/> From here on we’re gonna need this callin’ card thing.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-084.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> Making the target believe that the Treasure is in danger will cause it to materialize. That’s quite a bold trick.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-AnnGlitch.gif"/> Huh? She understood?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-YusukeGlitch.gif"/> Joker, we’ll defer to you regarding its timing.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-MorganaGlitch.gif"/> OK guys, let’s get ready for the heist!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-085.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-RyujiGlitch.gif"/> In the end, that Kaneshiro only showed his stupid face once...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-MorganaGlitch.gif"/> That doesn’t matter. As long as we steal the Treasure, we’ll change his heart.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoGlitch.gif"/> Then let’s act as the Phantom Thieves should and send the calling card. It’s on you, Joker.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-YusukeGlitch.gif"/> If you wish to train or explore further before sending it, that decision is purely yours.<br/>

<br/>
Next up, we head back to the Velvet Room, because we can fuse Flauros using a Group Guillotine. It requires Andras, Eligor, and Berith, with Eligor supplying the Tarukaja we need.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-088.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-089.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Flauros.jpg"/> I shall become a fiery mask of thine, with my powers to see the past and future...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Flauros is one of the 72 demons of the Goetia, who can see the past and future (but will always lie about them) and control fire.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-091.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Justine.png"/> This presence… I see. As we requested, you have brought us a <b>Flauros</b> with the skill <b>Tarukaja</b>.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Caroline.png"/> *chuckle* Very well… Your assignment’s done.<br/>
<br/>
...Huh, guess he didn’t get back to these before seeing the cursed image. Lucky me.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-092.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Caroline.png"/> True… I guess we’ve gotta at least admit that. Your Personas are starting to get pretty damn strong too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Justine.png"/> …… Is fostering Personas… truly rehabilitation?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Caroline.png"/> What’re you saying that for?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Justine.png"/> It is… merely a thought I had. Will the inmate truly be rehabilitated if we help cultivate power within him…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Caroline.png"/> Keep it together, Justine. This is the job our master ordered us to do. Or… are you gonna try and disobey your orders?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Justine.png"/> That is not what I meant...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Caroline.png"/> Don’t worry yourself too much over one measly prisoner. All we gotta do is get the most out of his wild card thing, and make him work hard at his tasks.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-093.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Justine.png"/> The wild card...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Caroline.png"/> What is it now?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Justine.png"/> The more I consider this list, the stranger it seems. Its writer must have known that the one carrying out these tasks would possess the power of the wild card…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Caroline.png"/> You’ve gotta be kidding me. How would somebody know that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Justine.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Caroline.png"/> I mean, even our master didn’t know the inmate had that wild card thing before we met him!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-094.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-095.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Caroline.png"/> Hmph. Either way, this’ll all get resolved if you just hurry up and finish your rehabilitation already! Justine, give him his next task so he’ll quit talking back!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Justine.png"/> ...Very well. It seems that it is time for us to be serious.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-ProtagNoGlasses.png"/> <i>I feel like my bond with Caroline and Justine is growing deeper...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-096.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Justine.png"/> As previously mentioned, here is the second task you must complete before receiving your reward.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-097.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Justine.png"/> You only need speak with us once you obtain it. We will be able to tell.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Caroline.png"/> Go work up a sweat, Inmate!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="111-098.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-099.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="113-100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And just like that, Kaneshiro’s Palace is done. All that’s left is to send the calling card and steal the Treasure.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-MorganaGlitch.gif"/> We finally secured our route to the Treasure! All we need to do now is send the calling card.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-YusukeGlitch.gif"/> Indeed… We have finished the prearrangements, and now we shall face the true test. But this is no time to panic, Joker. Let us ensure we succeed after having come so far.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="114-101.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-AnnChat.png"/> I have to agree. The earlier the better in my book.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-YusukeChat.jpg"/> There is no assurance he will keep his promise, after all. What are your thoughts on the matter, Makoto?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="117-103.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I have nothing to say here, it’s just that I keep breaking down laughing at the thought of the phrase “nasty crimes.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Hm, calm as always. Well, we’ll leave it up to you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-AnnChat.png"/> We’ll be ready to go whenever you are!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="118-104.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-TV.jpg"/> No villain can withstand the power of girls’ night! Revive and fight, Phoenix Rangers! Next episode… “I want a Love So Strong, It’d Bring Me Back from the Dead!”<br/>
<br/>
I was moderately into Power Rangers in my formative years so seeing this stuff always gives me a chuckle. Anyway, I’m finally free from the diabolical clutches of my ten-year-old brother. I can’t wait for this LP to be boring again. Next time!
