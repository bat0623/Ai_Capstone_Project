It’s Sunday, and you know what that means...<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-BDL.jpg"/> Yes! YES! The power of the Sun God has opened your eyes to the truth. Madarame is a pig rolling in a trough of money! By the name of the Sun God shall he be condemned!<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Protag.png"/> &gt;I want to do a clinical trial.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Tae.png"/> In that case, my little guinea pig, there’s something I want to test out today… Well then, please head into the examination room.<br/>
<br/>
Every time she says “guinea pig” it sends a fucking chill down my spine.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Tae.png"/> If you’re feeling OK, you can go home now.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Tae.png"/> ...What? Again? That’s, well… that ship’s already sailed, so...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-012.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Tae.png"/> You remember that girl from the other day? The Chief of Staff Oyamada’s patient? Her dad’s been bringing her here to be treated, even though I referred them to another hospital. I even told them about the medical error I made...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Tae.png"/> I’m just a quack though… The medical error was well documented. Everyone in my field knows about it. I led the development of a new drug for an incurable illness called “Crawford-Ende’s disease.” Although I wasn’t the one who administered the medicine, it was the cause of the error.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Tae.png"/> With Crawford-Ende’s, certain cells indiscriminately attack other cells throughout the body. When it reaches the muscles, the patient slowly begins to die… There hasn’t been much progress made on it-- partly because there haven’t been many cases of it. I worked with a pharmaceutical company that had reached the final stage of production, but… One day, I was suddenly removed from my position. That Chief of Staff Oyamada, my superior at the time, took over the entire operation.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Tae.png"/> He made careless mistakes and rushed completion so he could use it on a patient named Miwa. Miwa-chan had a reaction and lapsed into critical condition. The chief panicked and laid the blame on me. Miwa-chan and her family resented me… ...No matter what I said, I couldn’t change how they felt about me.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Tae.png"/> Well, that doesn’t matter… The development of the medicine was suspended, so I had no reason to stay at that hospital. At least now I can keep working as a general practitioner, on my own terms… with my guinea pig.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Tae.png"/> That’s the new medicine I’ve been trying out on you. This version is in the final stage of testing. It searches for those cells that take the offensive and destroys them upon detection. That’s why it’s harmless for people who don’t have the disease… probably.<br/>
<br/>
Wait, then how do you even know if it works?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Maaku’s kind of a dope.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I’m telling you, <i>chills.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Tae.png"/> You’d better not flake on me this late in the game. I’m inching closer to the finish line, but I need your help to reach it. In exchange, I can offer you medicine at a special price. I’m counting on you, guinea pig.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Protag.png"/> <i>It feels like my bond with Takemi is growing even deeper...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Now Takemi has new support items for sale. We’ll see what these do in a few updates, but they’re… I want to say “useful,” but I actually mean “mandatory.” Again, we’ll get to that in time.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Tae.png"/> Now, what should I do about that girl and her dad? Being mean and scaring them hasn’t worked. It’s been a while since I’ve had to deal with this kind of nuisance. It’s stressing me out. Oh, sorry, that’s all I wanted to talk to you about. You can go home now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Protag.png"/> <i>I feel like cooperating in that shady clinical trial has increased my <b>Guts</b>...</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Chatter.jpg"/> You can get as many wounds as you want if you have these!<br/>
<br/>
That’s a weird way to sell bandaids, lady. HURT YOURSELF AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-TV.jpg"/> This is a limited item! Today’s the one and only day it’ll be available! And it can be yours… For the incredibly low price of 1980 yen! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Morgana.png"/> <b>Adhesive Bandage</b>, huh? You wanna get fifty of them? They’re just 1980 yen.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This is an absurd deal. Fuck yeah, I want those bandages.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Souse.jpg"/> OK! And now it’sh time for the pop quiz ques… question! What’sh the painting… That made me, who is Madarame, so famoush?<br/>

Sadly, picking “Yukari” does not result in a Persona 3 reference.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Rocker.jpg"/> Shalalaaa, your smile…/Shalalala, during the rice season… No, no, that’s no good! Ah can’t let m’country side show any! I need to write a soul-shaking rock song… I need the gods of rock to speak through me!<br/>
<br/>
Looks like our resident rocker is actually a little bit country.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Foreign_Barker.jpg"/> Er, what I mean is, the food’s real good—I’m not calling you a dope or anything!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Cat.jpg"/> *confused meow*<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Foreign_Barker.jpg"/> Damn, I gotta get better at Japanese…<br/>
<br/>
Foreign Barker is one of my favorite characters.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
...And on the other end of that spectrum, here’s Mishima!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-MishimaGreen.png"/> I had pretty high hopes for them, but they turned out to be posers… The Phantom Thieves are true heroes though! I wanna help out however I can!<br/>
<br/>
He also nags us about that request he sent us, but we’re busy right now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
While we’re out, we buy the latest books. The other two are a spotlight on local parks and a fashion magazine “girls with unique tastes.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
You don’t know me, cat.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Oh hey, it’s that lady we saw by Madarame’s.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Ohya.png"/> I guess the editor-in-chief has been nagging me about covering the Phantom Thieves though… I guess I’ll just wait and see what happens. Time for me to go get a drink.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Tora.png"/> There are less physically abusive teachers nowadays, but the truth of it all is still a mystery. I’m giving a speech again today. Do you think you can lend me a hand with it?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Protag.png"/> &gt;Help him out<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Tora.png"/> Then let’s get to it. Can you please hold the placard?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Tora.png"/> ...Is not right! It will take time to solve this problem. However, we must start by making small changes!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Tora.png"/> Regardless of the audience’s size, you must convey your thoughts as if you’re talking one-on-one. By the way, I forgot to ask you last time we spoke. Why do you want to become a politician?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Tora.png"/> Ambitious, indeed, if a little ambiguous… Well, I’m sure you’ll iron out the details as you go along. May I ask you one more question? What kind of politician do you want to be?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-038.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It’s worth noting that Sun is one of two Confidants (along with Moon, though that one has other requirements as well) that do not require points and will rank up every time you visit them. The notes are just for flavor.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Tora.png"/> ...Allow me to give you some advice. If you aspire to get into politics, you must possess a central philosophy. What is it that you want to accomplish…? That is the foundation of a great speech. You’d do well to remember that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-040.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-041.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Tora.png"/> To get your message across, be tenacious in conveying your thoughts to the audience. Have a firm point of view, and communicate it clearly—that’s the first rule of negotiating. Haha! You have me reliving the fighting spirit I had when I first became a politician.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Protag.png"/> <i>Yoshida explained the basics of speech-giving. I feel like my bond with him is growing deeper...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Diplomacy lets you ask for more money or items after succeeding once, and is a great way to get tons of money from enemies by just asking over and over until they reject you and then knocking them back down and doing it again. Unfortunately, later upgrades to Sun make this impossible, to the point where I’ve seen people suggest keeping Sun at Rank 2. We won’t be doing that, because there’s other ways to get money, and it’s not all that scarce to begin with. Besides, not doing the best Confidant in the game because it’s sub-optimal isn’t my style.<br/>

<br/>
Poor Tora.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Tora.png"/> Ah, my apologies. We’re done for today.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Protag.png"/> <i>I feel like learning about the basics of negotiation has served to increase my <b>Charm</b>...</i><br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Charm +3</b>. Yes, really, +3 from a single Confidant rank. Tora owns.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Tora.png"/> Thank you for all your hard work. I’ll see you next time.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Yusuke.png"/> Madarame was talking to a lawyer. I suppose he’s serious about suing. I think we should advance our plans. Why won’t we go to the Palace today?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Eh, why not?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Yusuke.png"/> Great. I want to stop that man as soon as possible. In that case, let’s assemble after school. I’ll be over shortly.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Chouno.png"/> Artists with that good of an eye are rare in Japan. I wonder if he has synesthesia. Yes, regarding synesthesia… One of many English terms that comes from Greek root words. Haven’t you heard of it? It’s a condition where your senses can cross over each other, like seeing music as color. Mr. Hamiru. You were staring off into space, weren’t you? Well, your number’s up. The root words of synesthesia are “syn” and “aisthesis.” What do they mean?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Child’s play.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Chouno.png"/> Good! You’ve been studying! Unfortunately, synesthesia’s something you have to be born with… You can’t learn it. Some of the geniuses over the course of history have had synesthesia. The composer Franz Liszt instructed his orchestra to play the color purple.<br/>
<br/>
Must’ve been hard teaching them all to act! ...I’m sorry.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Chouno.png"/> The poet Arthur Rimbaud was also said to see colors in letters.<br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Knowledge +1</b>, and is <i>still</i> at Rank 1, fucking hell.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Chouno.png"/> Seeing colors in sounds and letters, and feeling shapes in flavors and numbers… Geniuses and common people see the world differently. Were you able to understand that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Morgana.png"/> Synesthesia, huh… That’s fascinating. Although, the reason Madarame sees the world differently is because of his distorted desires.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Morgana.png"/> OK, let’s head there now!<br/>
<br/>
<b>Music:</b> <a href="https://clyp.it/xgygzltf?token=453ba8f05314d2b84945c0acae73d4f5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Suspicion</a><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Ann.png"/> Oh, you mean about the Metaverse and the Nav. Yeah, I guess that stuff is pretty important.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Yusuke.png"/> Please elaborate.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Morgana.png"/> OK, let’s start from the beginning. First, the Metaverse spots where we act as the Phantom Thieves are called Palaces. Palaces are worlds that take form from someone’s cognition… A materialization of their reality.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Yusuke.png"/> So do we each hold Palaces within ourselves as well?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Morgana.png"/> No, not just anyone will have one. It’s primarily those with strong distorted desires…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Ryuji.png"/> They basically gotta be criminals. Real bastards like Kamoshida or Madarame.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Morgana.png"/> On the other hand, Palaces can’t exist within Persona-users. It’s just impossible for them to form. Basically, your Persona is the true feelings of your heart, which arise from conquering your inner Shadow. Then since you have full control of your emotions, there’s no way your desires can get distorted.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Ann.png"/> S-So that’s how it works...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Ryuji.png"/> O-Obviously I knew that…! Oh, and we use the Metaverse Nav app on our phones to get into that world!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Ann.png"/> It’s actually pretty simple. Just say a person’s name, location, and distortion, then you’re in.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Yusuke.png"/> Location…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Ann.png"/> Uhhh, so like Madarame’s would be “shack,” then his distortion is that he thinks it’s a “museum.”<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Yusuke.png"/> How do you know what their Palace is going to look like if you have never set foot in it before…?<br/>
<br/>
We fucking guess, Yusuke. It absolutely kills the narrative momentum.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Ryuji.png"/> That part’s kinda like a quiz or something. It’ll prolly get pretty tricky from here on out too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Yusuke.png"/> Hm, I feel as though I have a good grasp on the basic concepts. If anything arises which I fail to understand, I’ll rely on those more experienced than myself.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Ryuji.png"/> Yeah! I gotcha covered, newbie!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Ann.png"/> Uh… You should probably ask Morgana if you need anything.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Morgana.png"/> Thinking back to Madarame though… I can’t believe he’d consider pressing charges.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Yusuke.png"/> Yes, I’ve never seen him show such anger before. He is most likely quite serious about that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Ann.png"/> What should we do…? There’s no way we’ll be able to win if that happens.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Yusuke.png"/> He likely won’t act on that threat until the final day of the exhibit: <b>June 5th</b>. Simply put, I doubt he would be so foolish as to taint his name with a trial during his exhibition.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Ryuji.png"/> All right, so we just gotta steal Madarame’s heart by then. There’s no way we’re gonna let him press charges… We’ll show people who he really is!<br/>
<br/>

And after all that, we’re finally ready to head back into Madarame’s Palace.
