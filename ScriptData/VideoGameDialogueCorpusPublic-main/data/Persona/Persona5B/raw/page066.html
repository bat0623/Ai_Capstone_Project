<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> Of course I am. Palaces, changing hearts… It’s hard to tell what’s reality anymore… Still, the only thing I can do now is believe.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kawakami.png"/> Not like that means I’ll put up bamboo decorations and write my wish on a piece of paper though. I’m not feeling it this year. Oh, but there’s a traditional food associated with Tanabata, just as chocolate is to Valentine’s Day. OK, Hamiru-kun! What’s the traditional food of Tanabata?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Obviously.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kawakami.png"/> Right. Wow. I’m kind of surprised. You actually care about seasonal holidays and stuff? Originally, in China they ate a baked good that we call sakubei in Japanese to appease demons. Over time, that pronunciation went from sakubei, to sakumen, to soumen—a wholly different food.<br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Knowledge +1</b>.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kawakami.png"/> Going with the theme of calming demons, soumen on Tanabata is sometimes called “demon guts.”<br/>
<br/>
Alright, I’m way more interested now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kawakami.png"/> Go restore your strength with some seasonal food and get ready for your exams.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> Oh yeah, it’s almost finals time… They start on the 13th, right? There’s less than a week left. Are you gonna be ready?<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> The truth is… recently I’ve started questioning the entire point of my education. What do I stand to gain from getting good grades and living up to the high expectations my sister has set for me? I spoke to Eiko about this matter as well, but the answer hasn’t become any clearer...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> You don’t remember? Eiko Takao. We asked her about the job she has at the “salon” in Shinjuku.<br/>
<br/>
That was like three days ago. Are you okay, Maaku? You feeling all right?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> Anyway, we’ve been calling each other every so often since we exchanged contact information. Because of those calls, we’ve actually grown somewhat close. When I voiced my concerns to her, she asked me how I would benefit from going to a top university. But… I couldn’t come up with a good answer. As for Eiko, her grades are… not the best, but she claims she doesn’t even think about that stuff. Apparently her parents can use their connections to find her a job… But isn’t that a little irresponsible? It’s nice she can rely on her parents, but this is her life, not theirs. ...I guess that’s just a different way of approaching things. Even at that, her vision of the future is still clearer than mine.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> ...I used to think doing what others expected of me was the best way forward. I was going to major in law, just like my sister did. And after that, I would simply have headed down whatever path society had made for me...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> I’ve realized now there are more important things in life than being a prim and proper honor student. Honestly, I would have looked down on Eiko’s line of thinking in the past… but I know better now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-013.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> Lately, Eiko’s been telling me whenever she buys makeup or finds a cute new outfit. That reminds me, she asked me the other day what hand cream I use. I sent her a picture… and it’s apparently the same brand they use in the nurse’s office at school.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-015.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> My father used to use it all the time. ...Did I ever tell you he was a police officer? He detested the corruption in our society, and worked tirelessly to bring it to justice… But despite the rough exterior, he was extremely gentle deep down. When I was little, I told him I wanted to grow up to be a police officer, just like he was.<br/>
<br/>
Are we gonna have a <i>problem</i>, Makoto?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> He was glad to hear me say that, but quick to point out that he didn’t want me doing something so dangerous. I had completely forgotten that dream, to be honest...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
…if you’re a fuckin’ snitch. Jesus christ, a whole family of pigs. I shoulda known better!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> Either way, after everything that happened… I have no intention of working with the police.<br/>
<br/>
Good. Let’s keep it that way.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> Besides, they’re trying to stop the Phantom Thieves. What am I supposed to do, arrest myself? Hm… I think I need to reexamine what my goals for the future are, outside of just plain studying. You know, it feels like I remembered something important today thanks to you. I guess you could say my viewpoint has been broadened yet again.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Protag.png"/> <i>I can sense a quiet resolve from Makoto...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-019.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> I only just learned recently that a chemise is now called a camisole, and a button-down sweater is a cardigan...<br/>
<br/>
That’s a little esoteric, but whatever.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> Why does the same thing have to have multiple names…? I guess in the end, I’m just becoming more aware of how little I really know. So… please, help me keep fighting back against that ignorance. Thank you again for today. See you later.<br/>

Time to reacquaint ourselves with our second favorite alcoholic.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Ohya.png"/> But I guess that doesn’t have anything to do with you… Have you heard any good gossip? My deadline’s coming up, and I’m all out of material. Sit down. I’ll treat ya.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Protag.png"/> &gt;Hang out with her<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Ohya.png"/> For real? From the look of it, you must have good info, huh? Give me the details about the Kamoshida incident.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Ohya.png"/> So the calling card they used for Kamoshida was different… Now that’s a scoop. That kind of information usually doesn’t see the light of day. ...You have any photos or videos of it?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Sorry, Mishima!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Ohya.png"/> *chuckle* But seriously, the “Phantom Thieves of Hearts”? They sound like kids on a playground, not valiant fighters for society… I mean, they act all high and mighty, but I’m not sure they’re really worth very much in the end.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Ohya.png"/> Hah, that’s hilarious! You think they’re actually virtuous? In my line of work, there’s no clearer sign of deception than goodwill. You know, like the shady actions of a charitable organization, or the actual criteria of a peace prize. Same goes for the Phantom Thieves. You just have to learn to take some things with a grain of salt.<br/>
<br/>
Man, Ohya, you’re really kind of a drag.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> C’mon, don’t be such a downer...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Ohya.png"/> Why? It’s the truth.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> There you go again… You used to be so positive.<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> We’re all out. ...Hey, why don’t you go back to covering politics?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Ohya.png"/> No can do. I’ve been permanently reassigned to the culture and entertainment department.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> *sigh* What a crappy company… I mean, it’s already been over a year since the incident.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> Oh, by the incident, I mean--<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Ohya.png"/> Don’t say another word. That has nothing to do with my source.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> Right, sorry...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Ohya.png"/> Urgh, dammit! I’m already sobering up. Gimme a refill, Lala-chan!<br/>

<br/>
This is a little fuckin’ morbid for a high school science class.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Hiruta.png"/> Speaking of ice, shaved ice is one of the symbols of summer.<br/>
<br/>
That was certainly a segue.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Hiruta.png"/> Usually sold at festivals, they come in many varieties such as melon and strawberry. Hamiru-kun. Let me ask you a question. What is a common trait of almost all shaved-ice syrups on the market?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Hiruta.png"/> Correct. The truth is, almost all kinds of syrup have the same flavor. The ingredients used are corn syrup, fragrance, food coloring… it’s essentially sugar water. Try closing your eyes, plugging your nose, and tasting shaved ice with just your tongue. You’ll likely be unable to tell what flavor it is. That cold, sweet strawberry flavor is just a deception of summer produced by color and smell…<br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Knowledge +1</b>.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Hiruta.png"/> But before you can enjoy the sweet illusions of summer, you have very real exams waiting for you. They start next week on the 13th. Well, good luck.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> Less than a week, huh? Have you been studying?<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Flower_Shop.jpg"/> Oh right, I didn’t explain things to you last time. We’ll occasionally get orders for bouquets, in which case I’d like you to pick out the flowers. I’ll vary your pay based on how pleased the customers are with what you chose… Oh, and if you get stuck, I suggest you study up with the Flowerpedia. You can do it!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-049.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Flower_Shop.jpg"/> The customer is looking for <b>large, brightly-colored flowers</b>. Pick three that fit the description.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Music:</b> <a href="https://clyp.it/1tygxglo?token=af77ade79dbeca408077e7247ff31d2d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Everyday Days</a><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> This request is for <b>large, brightly-colored flowers</b>. I bet light colors or white would even work too. Which flower will you pick first?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Every other time you go to work at the flower shop, you’ll be asked to make a bouquet. This is why we read the Flowerpedia earlier, even if we technically didn’t need to. The Flowerpedia, for the record, shows us additional details about the flowers, like what they represent and their aromas. I don’t think the first request requires it, asking you to pick from easily identifiable traits of the flowers. If we succeed, we get a considerable pay boost and an extra point of Kindness, so we definitely want to get this right.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so Morgana says that you can pick light colors or white to fulfill this request. This is technically accurate, in that you can make that compromise once. Picking two that aren’t bright colors (like, say, light pink and white) will give you a “satisfactory” result and you won’t get the extra pay or Kindness boost.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> OK, pick the second flower now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> On to the third and final flower.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
There are other flowers that would have worked, but these three are fine.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> The order was for <b>large, brightly-colored flowers</b>. Is this OK?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> I hope the customer likes it...<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-MakotoChat.jpg"/> True, there does seem to be some movement. Sis actually sent me a message saying she won’t be home tonight. There’s a chance that the police have found their breakthrough.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-RyujiChat.png"/> Ooooh, does that mean it happened!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-AnnChat.png"/> The timing is perfect. I guess let’s just hope for the best?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-RyujiChat.png"/> I’m gonna stay up all night watching the news to find out!<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> I guess that means we’re the only ones who can fight back against someone like Kaneshiro.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Ohya.png"/> Seriously, where do you get this stuff from? True believers are scary… Hey, you want a drink?<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Ohya.png"/> I didn’t know it was so popular with high school kids. I haven’t been paying much attention to it. But if it’s newsworthy, I guess I should keep tabs on it. The Phantom Thieves must be really bored if they’re going after small-time criminals now. I have a theory that they’re all minors, and their leader is some simpleton dying from boredom...<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Ohya.png"/> Plus if it only takes a second to change a person’s heart, they totally wouldn’t be bored. Well, I’m not really interested in writing entertainment articles about whatever fad’s caught on.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> But they do really well, right? Some journalists who were in here seemed frustrated about that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Ohya.png"/> Journalists…? Oh, you mean Nakao and the others?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Ohya.png"/> Hey, I wasn’t looking for some kid to butt in! Entertainment articles are all about selling copies… The truth doesn’t even matter. Nobody wants to read real news...<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> But at this rate, you...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Ohya.png"/> If I quit now, it’d be the same as declaring my partner guilty.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Ohya.png"/> That’s why I can’t quit… and why I’ll never give up.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Ohya.png"/> ...I mean, never mind! Hahaha! But… thanks to you, I’ve had more time to focus on my own investigation. I’m going to write an article that you’ll really enjoy! Think of it as a sign of my appreciation! I can see it now! “Exclusive: Behind the Incredible Phantom Thieves! Dial 911 for justice!” ...How’s that sound? Haha, don’t worry! I’ll take it seriously. After all… that’s what I promised you.<br/>
