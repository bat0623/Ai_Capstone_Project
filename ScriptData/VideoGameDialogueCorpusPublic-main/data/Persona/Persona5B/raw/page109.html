<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MorganaAngry.png"/> If Haru’s sold off, our failure will sully the Phantom Thieves name.<br/>
<br/>
“Sold off”? That’s a really weird way of phrasing that, man.<br/>

All right! New mission! Time to fuck around, ignore every single one of our friends and responsibilities, talk to every NPC in the game again, and blitz through the Palace in a single day, putting tremendous strain on myself as well as you, the viewing audience!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Old_Man.jpg"/> It’s the government’s fault. Why do they pick on people on the National Pension like us? Young people are pathetic, too. They’re so quick to complain and claim they’re getting exploited. <br/>
<br/>
Surely this can’t be because they’re <i>actually getting exploited, you fucking raisin?</i> No, it must be those whiny children who are wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Old_Woman.jpg"/> You think so? I think they work just as hard as we did, don’t they? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Old_Man_2.jpg"/> No! They’re weak, I’m telling you!<br/>
<br/>
Not quite sure what that was about...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Boom_Box.jpg"/> We’ve been gathering stories about the corrupt bosses that people have worked for. We’ve gotten tons of responses so far. People have been sending stories of such terrible things… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Old_Man_3.jpg"/> They’re blowing things out of proportion. Young people today are just too soft.<br/>
<br/>
Kill all the old people, it’s the only way to be sure.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
One thing we’re going to try to do at least a few times for the rest of the game is buy more materials and transmutable weapons wherever and whenever we can. I have no idea if I’ll end up using any of this, but it’s worth a shot.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh no! The dog is sick!<br/>
<br/>
Also, I guess we really are using the “sold off” terminology. That’s pretty uncomfortable, not gonna lie.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Dog-loving_Girl.jpg"/> Huh? Kotaro seems kinda tired though… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Missile.png"/> *whine*…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Mother.jpg"/> This summer was really hot, so he’s a little worn out… Let’s leave the bad guys to the Phantom Thieves and let him rest. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Reporter.jpg"/> Stirring up the popularity of the Phantom Thieves was a success. Now we’ll focus on Okumura Foods! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Young_Cameraman.jpg"/> We shouldn’t go too far… Okumura’s a major sponsor of ours, you know. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Reporter.jpg"/> I told you, don’t get cold feet! Our viewers can’t get enough of the Phantom Thieves’ craze! We’ll get to bash both the police and the politicians. It’ll be double the fun. *snicker*<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-BDL.jpg"/> That is the fate of an economic supremacist, contaminated by the surge of darkness! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Protestor.jpg"/> Stand up, Phantom Thieves! Apostles of the Sun! Go and fulfill the will of the Sun God! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-BDL.jpg"/> Please remember this: The Phantom Thieves only exist thanks to the Sun God! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Woman_7.jpg"/> Thinking about what happened with Okumura Foods made me realize that… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Woman_6.jpg"/> I’m not sure that’s a good comparison… Anyway, how old did you tell your boyfriend you were?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Woman_7.jpg"/> ...I told him I was 15 years younger than I really am. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, I don’t mean to alarm anyone, but between her description as “Young-looking Woman,” her previous obsession with Akechi, and her rather extreme predilection for dating men massively younger than her, I think this woman might be an actual pedophile. <br/>

Kishi? That dude we did a change of heart for like two weeks ago? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Office_Worker.jpg"/> A...All right. Thank you! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Kishi_2.jpg"/> Knock it out of the park and the drinks are on me! Just be ready for an all-night rager! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Office_Worker.jpg"/> No, no, nooo—I can’t. My wife would kill me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Morgana.png"/> Looks like the change of heart worked. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Woman_8.jpg"/> It’s all lies! Everyone’s out to get Okumura Foods because they’re jealous of its success! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Woman_9.jpg"/> Are you sure? My husband, he never receives any overtime pay, so… I wonder if they’ll pin this on the CEO. He should probably just admit the truth. Ohoho… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Man_7.jpg"/> The girls love lines like that. It’s all thanks to the Phantom Thieves! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Man_5.jpg"/> Hoho, you’re starting to get the hang of it. Hit a homerun with that Love Thief line, did you? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Man_7.jpg"/> Actually, the “Love Thief” line didn’t work out so well. I always hear it’s lame and hard to get...<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Fishy_Hawker.jpg"/> Oh, got you interested, huh? Well, if that’s the case, you ought to see our new product! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Fishy_Hawker.jpg"/> Don’t be so full of yourself, kid. I’m no Phantom Thief, but I can make you beg for forgiveness, too. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Lawyer.jpg"/> Who knows? It’s not as flashy a target as Medjed though. Companies all over the country exploit their workers. Will taking down one of them change anything? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Winger.jpg"/> I’m sure it will affect public opinion. I guess we’ll sit back and watch what they do. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Maid.jpg"/> Ugh, don’t tell me what to do, you annoying jerk. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Office_Worker.jpg"/> Whoa, it’s true! She’s a real-life tsundere maid! Yeah, harsh on the outside, and shy on the inside.<br/>
<br/>
In case you’ve never watched a bad anime and thus don’t know what “tsundere” means, it’s basically what this dude just described, summed up in the oft-used phrase, “it’s not like I like you or anything.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Maid.jpg"/> Gross… Gross, gross gross! Don’t come near me!<br/>
<br/>
A fair response. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Nerd.jpg"/> Must be a leak from the opposition party. I read about that on a news blog. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Man_3.jpg"/> Really!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Nerd.jpg"/> See for yourself. Just search for “Okumura Foods” in the archives and you’ll find a lot of articles. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Busy_Young_Man.jpg"/> Don’t worry! I cut my losses! If I want to rule the market, I should know when to back out! I’m gonna live as a trader. No, I was born to be a trader! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Woman_7.jpg"/> Huh? Wait, what about your job? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Busy_Young_Man.jpg"/> Didn’t I tell you? I quit! We’ll rrrevolutionize ourselves and live like celebrities!<br/>
<br/>
This game has so many pure, wonderful idiots.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Man_5.jpg"/> Oh, I’ve heard about him. He’s just a little guy, huh? Must still be in grade school… He’s dual-wielding…?<br/>
<br/>
…! No… It can’t be...<br/>
<br/>
*ahem* Sorry, I’m terminally incapable of hearing the words “dual-wielding” and not freaking out after the copious amounts of SAO I’ve consumed.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Office_Worker.jpg"/> Yeah, he’s playing two opponents all by himself. And it’s still too easy for him. <br/>

<br/>
Ohshit<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Shinya.png"/> So, you’re saying you wanna beat the cheater? You seem like a nice guy… but just let it go. The Phantom Thieves are really cool, aren’t they!? Are you a fan, too? Have you ever met them? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-036.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh god, I just noticed that his jacket says “NOOB” in addition to the “GET SMOKED” cap, this is amazing.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Shinya.png"/> But, um… Teaching you how to play Gun About won’t be easy… And I won’t get anything out of it… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Shinya.png"/> Geez, you’re really persistent. I’m just a grade schooler, y’know. How about this… I wanna get to know the Phantom Thieves.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Shinya.png"/> ...It’s probably impossible, but if you can help me do that, then I’ll teach you how to play. Well, whaddaya say? Is it a deal? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It’s a big ask, kid, but I like your moxie. Let’s do this! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Shinya.png"/> ...Wait, what? You’re not gonna say no!? Well, if you really want to THAT much, then… I thought for sure you were gonna give up… Wow, I didn’t see this coming. But the Phantom Thieves hide their true identities, right? Are you sure I can get to know them? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Shinya.png"/> Huh? You’re gonna tell them my name? …… My name’s Shinya Oda. Tell the Phantom Thieves my name, and have them post it somewhere only they’d be able to access. That’ll be good enough as an autograph, and proof that they know my name. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Morgana.png"/> We need something credible for this kid to believe us. Didn’t Futaba say she hacked into Gun About’s server or something? Let’s bring this up with her. Might lead us to some good ideas. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Music:</b> <a href="https://clyp.it/p22gxmxz?token=665445b6f0814169fca591db1828cdde" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tokyo Emergency</a><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Futaba isn’t actually available to hang out today, but “activating” this stage of the Shinya sidequest “summoned” her. However, we still can’t hang out with her, because the game will make us go back to Shinya instead once we’re done here. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-FutabaTankTop.png"/> So, did he tell you how to take down that cheater? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Morgana.png"/> He’s going to, on one condition: he wants us to introduce him to the Phantom Thieves. We can’t just give ourselves away though. That’s where you come in. Maybe you could hack into the Gun About server and do something? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-FutabaTankTop.png"/> But we won’t be able to get in touch with him that way… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Morgana.png"/> A calling card…? What are we going to steal? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-FutabaTankTop.png"/> Oh, how about the home page? I already hacked into it, so it’s as good as stolen!<br/>
<br/>
After you already used the home page once to send a message to that cheater, you’d think they’d have closed that glaring vulnerability. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Morgana.png"/> Hm, OK. I’ll write a calling card saying that we’re going to steal the Gun About home page. After that, you’ll need to leave evidence that the Phantom Thieves hacked into it. The King will have no choice but to believe it was really us. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-FutabaTankTop.png"/> Oooh, this sounds like fun. I’ll put our logo smack dab at the top of the front page. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Morgana.png"/> Perfect. We’ll go see the King. Oh, and we’ll let you know before we talk to him, so wait for our word to start the hacking. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-FutabaTankTop.png"/> All right, you can count on me. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Morgana.png"/> Should we ask Futaba about the hacking? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-047.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-FutabaChat.jpg"/> It’ll be fine! Leave it to me! OK, I’m hacking in now. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
So, uh… Shinya. Oh sweet, innocent Shinya.<br/>
<br/>
So, Shinya is voiced by Barbara Goodson, probably best known as Laharl from Disgaea (and <i>fucking Rita Repulsa, how could I possibly forget</i>)… and it’s really just a <i>hell</i> of a performance. <a href="http://polsy.org.uk/play/yt/?vurl=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FleN66jt61Tc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Here’s the entire event,</a> just so you can hear it, but… click wisely.<br/>

This is a promise to you from the Phantom Thieves: We’re going to post a secret message, just for you, on the game’s official website.” …… Is… Is this for real? I mean, you can probably just buy one of these cards at the store… <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Shinya.png"/> That’s so cool… So they want to remain anonymous… Wow, I can’t believe they sent me a message… I wasn’t expecting much from you, Hamiru-san, but you’re actually pretty cool. I wish I was able to talk with them—or something—though… But you fulfilled your part of the deal, so I’ll teach you how to shoot. <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Shoot.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Shinya.png"/> ...C’mon, you gotta aim. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Shinya.png"/> ...No, no, no. You’re just stopping their movement by doing that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Shinya.png"/> Are you taking this seriously!? You gotta focus on your second shot! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Protag.png"/> <i>He’s almost like a different person when he gets mad. His instructions are precise, but also spartan-like...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...No he’s not?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Office_Worker.jpg"/> That’s what happens when he teams up with another player. And why everyone also watches him from a distance…<br/>
<br/>
The second line there is delivered really strangely. The actor was clearly going for “sardonic” but it comes out as “rushed to meet non-existent lip flaps.”<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Shinya.png"/> But I think you have a lot of potential. More than most people! If you want… I can teach you a few other moves too! I have the ultimate trump card. So tell me more about the Phantom Thieves! <br/>

So, Tower is an interesting arcana, symbolizing destruction, revelation, and sudden change. When reversed, it represents avoidance of disaster and fear of change. It’s probably the most universally “negative” card in the deck.<br/>
<br/>
Down Shot lets us spend all the ammunition in our clip to down a single enemy. This is pretty much only worth it on Treasure Demons and enemies without weaknesses due to the exorbitant ammunition cost, but it’s still handy occasionally. It should also go without saying that it’s fucking worthless on bosses, just like every other interesting part of combat in this game.<br/>

We’re just going to buy literally everything we can: the Nirvana Ring, the Black Rock, the Five-inch Nail, and three Condenser Lenses. The Nirvana Ring gives high resistance to Bless damage. The Black Rock lets us transmute a Persona into an accessory. The Five-inch Nail deals 50 Curse damage to a foe, which is useful if you don’t have that on a Persona yet but not that useful because you can’t buy them in bulk. The Condenser Lenses are just crafting materials. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="153-Sojiro.png"/> Yeah? And what have YOU done to care for her? <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="153-Sojiro.png"/> Don’t be ridiculous. Futaba had a terrible life living with you… Plus, I already gave you most of the inheritance for custody! Is that still not enough for you!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="162-Un.jpg"/> We could always find out in court. I wonder who’d win between a blood relative and a mere legal guardian… <br/>

It’s actually not that surprising. He alluded multiple times to being related to Futaba.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="153-Sojiro.png"/> After Wakaba died, Futaba was passed around all her relatives… His place was the last. He treated her like garbage. He never fed her, and forced her to sleep on the floor like an animal. He didn’t even let her bathe… Once I learned that, I knew I had to step in.<br/>
<br/>
My god, this dude is a fucking cartoon supervillain. This is the plot of the unproduced third Rescuers film, isn’t it?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="153-Sojiro.png"/> I couldn’t stand for that kind of horrible treatment, so I decided to take Futaba under my care. Even back then, he was whining about all the damn expenses. I threw some cash his way, thinking that would put the issue to bed… but now he’s back for more. I don’t even know how he managed to find me here… Maybe paying him was a mistake.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="174-115.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="153-Sojiro.png"/> Either way though, it’s my fault Futaba didn’t leave her room. I just didn’t know how to help her through it… I’d make curry, leave it by her door, and go. If not for you, I’d probably still be waiting for her to come out. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="176-117.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="153-Sojiro.png"/> They say blood’s thicker than water, right? I wonder what’d be the best for Futaba… <br/>
<br/>
Not that fucking dude! Holy shit, are you really considering this!?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="153-Sojiro.png"/> Haha… Look at me, spilling my heart out to a punk like you. Though… it’s kinda weird. For some reason, I just feel like telling you this stuff. It’s like you’re peering into my heart… Heh, I guess there really is something special about you. <br/>

There’s really no reason to be making coffee at this point in the game, especially once you unlock Affinity Reading, so I’ve never made use of Coffee Mastery. From what I hear, though, it upgrades coffee’s SP restoration from 30 to 100. Not bad.<br/>
