<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-YusukeNoMask.png"/> I learned much from you, Madarame. In order to see authenticity… one must be dispassionately realistic. <br/>

Yusuke’s cut-in is… pretty intense.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Somehow, Yusuke also has a goddamn rifle with him, which we won’t think too much about.<br/>

<br/>
These guys go down eventually, and we happen to get Yusuke’s finisher while we’re at it.<br/>

Yusuke approaches Madarame, but collapses.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-MadarameShadow.png"/> Yusuke, you’ve just thrown your bright future down the drain.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-YusukeFox.png"/> What a disgrace I am…!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-YusukeFox.png"/> I’m no fool. Strange people have been coming by for years, and the plagiarism was an everyday affair. But… who would want to admit that the man they owned their life to was doing such terrible things?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-AnnPanther.png"/> Why didn’t you leave, Kitagawa-kun?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-YusukeFox.png"/> Well, he is the one who painted the “Sayuri.” On top of that, I owe him a great debt.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-RyujiSkull.png"/> You mean ‘cause he raised you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-YusukeFox.png"/> I… never knew my father. I was told my mother raised me by herself, but she died in an accident when I was three. That’s when Sensei took me in. I heard he helped my mother while she was still alive.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-AnnPanther.png"/> Heard…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-YusukeFox.png"/> To be honest, I don’t remember much about my mother either. I did everything I could for Sensei. I thought of him as a father… but he changed.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-RyujiSkull.png"/> ...A lot’s happened to you, huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-YusukeFox.png"/> When you had mentioned plagiarism… deep down I knew you were right. That’s why I so vehemently denied you… I was simply running from the truth. I’m sorry.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-YusukeFox.png"/> I’m grateful for the chance to face what I have been denying all this time.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-RyujiSkull.png"/> That’s why you’re always gettin’ stuck in your own head. Look at me! I just go with the flow.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-AnnPanther.png"/> For real.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Morgana.png"/> What are you going to do now?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-YusukeFox.png"/> I don’t know...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-RyujiSkull.png"/> We can’t help the fact that Madarame’s gone and changed. But… we can change his heart. We’ll make him pay for his crimes.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-YusukeFox.png"/> That reminds me, you mentioned something about that “change of heart” earlier...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-RyujiSkull.png"/> Have you heard the rumors? The ones about the Phantom Thieves that steal hearts?<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Yusuke.png"/> And because of that, this PE teacher’s had a change of heart… The Phantom Thieves who steal hearts… To think they truly exist.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Yusuke.png"/> No, I believe you… There’s no need for common sense to blind me after seeing a world like that. So your plan with Madarame-sensei—with Madarame is to force a change of heart, correct? Let me join… as a member of the Phantom Thieves.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Yusuke.png"/> Had I faced reality sooner, this may have been avoided. I must put an end to this for the sake of the others whose futures as artists were robbed, as well. That… is the most civil thing I can do for the man who was… in some manner, my father.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> ...Civil, huh.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Ryuji.png"/> Sounds fine to me. We’re gonna deal with Madarame anyways.<br/> 
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Morgana.png"/> ...Remember how we mentioned this on our way here?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Yusuke.png"/> Madarame is a man who has the art world under his thumb. He has connections to many organizations. If someone like me raises my voice, it’ll only be snubbed out. ...We have no option but this.<br/>
<br/>
“Just FYI, he might die.” “Fuck it, already said yes.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> Kitagawa-kun...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-025.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> I hope we get along, Yusuke!<br/>
<br/>
You’re awful quick to forget the blackmail.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Ryuji.png"/> You better not slow us down.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Yusuke.png"/> I’ll do my best.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
As funny as I’m sure the nude paintings line is I’m eager to put all that behind us. Also, “don’t betray us” seems hilariously on-the-nose.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Yusuke.png"/> Thank you. I ask that you coach me well.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> Oh, that reminds me… I wonder what’s going on with the real Madarame. Yusuke and I were in a pretty tight situation… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Yusuke.png"/> Actually, I contacted him before we came here. He believes that I continued pursuing Takamaki-san. And, just as you all explained, it appears he knows nothing about his Shadow.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> What did he say…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Yusuke.png"/> He was complaining to the security company how they couldn’t even catch one high school girl. However, he’s still furious about it, and said that he’s going to take legal action against everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Ryuji.png"/> Talk about bein’ completely on guard...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> Legal action… He’s acting way too desperate. Maybe he still has more secrets.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Yusuke.png"/> If he were to act, it’d be after the exhibit is over. Any scandal during the show would be his loss.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> Right when I think the talk about being a nude model is over, this happens…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Morgana.png"/> We’ll have to force a change of heart before then, if we’re to dodge this “legal action” thing. Looks like our plan must be accomplished while the exhibit is still open!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Ryuji.png"/> Why not?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> He’s just on a different wavelength than other people.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Morgana.png"/> Do you wish to draw me? You better bring out the best of me in that case.<br/>

Draw me like one of your dated references.<br/>

Yusuke presses the call bell, which I guess is a thing in Japanese diners.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Yusuke.png"/> I was thinking of ordering some black-bean jelly.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Ryuji.png"/> I bet he got that idea from a “black cat”...<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-RyujiChat.png"/> If the police hear about this, they’ll totally get in touch with the school. We’ll get expelled for sure this time.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-AnnChat.png"/> School would be the least of our worries… We’d end up arrested. Unlawful entry, defamation...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-RyujiChat.png"/> Guess that means we really can’t afford to eff it up this time.<br/>
<br/>
I can’t believe they’re so committed to not letting Ryuji say “fuck” they’d even have him type out the word “eff.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-AnnChat.png"/> Yeah, from here on out is what really matters. Let’s do it!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Morgana.png"/> We just need to change his heart before he presses charges. Try to focus on that problem for now.<br/>

Many of his pieces—from when he first started, all the way to the present—are on display. Praised by critics, the exhibition also shows the evolution of the master’s style through the years.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Usami.png"/> The golden ratio used in the Mona Lisa and the Parthenon is a famous example. But a different ratio has been used in Japanese art and architecture since ancient times. Do you know what it is? Now then, Hamiru-san. Take a look at this.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-042.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-043.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Usami.png"/> One theory says it’s because Asians have rounder faces than Westerners, so they prefer a similar shape. This ratio was used in things like ukiyo-e paintings and the pagodas at Horyuji Temple. One you should all be familiar with is B4-size paper. Those proportions are the silver ratio.<br/>

Maaku gains <b>Knowledge +1</b>.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Usami.png"/> Oh yeah, I hear that mascots that are seen as cute have faces that are close to this ratio. In other words, if you use this ratio, you can make cute things.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Morgana.png"/> It is true that mascots tend to have round-ish faces… Huh? Why’re you looking at me like that?<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Justine.png"/> In order to promote that process, we would like to offer you the use of a new facility.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Justine.png"/> As wardens, we simply feel satisfaction in seeing your rehabilitation progress. ...That is the extent of it. I find it upsetting that you would see such a matter as a source of amusement.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Caroline.png"/> It’s like you forget where you are, Inmate. You’ve got some real guts though! With that spirit, you should have no trouble making progress!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Justine.png"/> Very well then… If you have the will to continue your penal labor, we can grant you greater freedom within this prison. It is a deal between us, the wardens, and you, the inmate.<br/>

No Sae flashforward this time. Strength is the arcana of inner strength and determination, as well as physical strength, though it’s not the focus, unlike the Chariot. It represents concepts like patience, but when reversed signals weakness and self-doubt.<br/>

The Triangle Spread, which let you fuse three Personas in 3 and 4, is curiously absent from Persona 5. Instead, you’ll do almost all your fusing from two Personas and select few special Personas are only attainable through the Group Guillotine, which takes its place. The Group Guillotine requires you to place specific fodder Personas into preset “recipes” to work, unlike the open system of regular fusion.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Justine.png"/> Please talk to us again once you have it.<br/>

Next, we fuse a Kushi Mitama from Succubus and Hua Po.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Kushi_Mitama.jpg"/> I’ll bring some vigor back to your body. Come on, let’s check out the mysterious nature of this world!<br/>
<br/>
Kushi Mitama is another Mitama, this one representing the “wondrous soul,” having the power to cause transformations and cure illnesses according to Shinto belief.<br/>

While we’re out, I also think to check out the gym Ryuji showed us.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-058.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
HP and SP, huh? Sounds decent (but we’ll still never do it).<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Now that Yusuke’s joined the party, a new book has become available from the library. We check it out.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Protag.png"/> &gt;Let’s hang out.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> Are you sure about that? We still haven’t found the Treasure...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> I guess there’s no point in worrying if you’re so sure… Oh yeah! I started training, so you should totally help me out if you have the time.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Protag.png"/> &gt;Hang out with her<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> All right, let’s go. Hm, the best way to get to Inokashira Park is by train, right?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We found a new spot!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> So, remember how I said before that I want to strengthen my heart? Well, I came up with a way to do it!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> I think having a strong heart means you don’t let anything get under your skin. So basically, I want you to say stuff to me, and I’ll try not to get fazed by it!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-066.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-067.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Protag.png"/> <i>I guess I should say something to Ann...</i><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> C’mon, hit me with your best shot!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> Yeah, yeah, yeah! And?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> Uh-huh, uh-huh. What else?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Maaku’s really not feeling this.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-072.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> Wait… is this how the game is supposed to go?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> Oh well. On to round two!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-074.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> …… You know… I kinda feel like this won’t make our Personas stronger.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-076.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> Huh, something’s not right...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-077.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> Oh, sorry. I just got an email from my agency. The next shoot is… really far. Wait, what’s this at the end? It’s a notice saying to pay extra attention to the time and place they tell you. Apparently some models haven’t been showing up at all lately. Then when asked why they didn’t come, the models all say they heard there was a change in schedule. It sounds like shoots have been real hectic with all the scrambling they’ve had to do for substitutes.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-078.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> It probably really confuses the staff to see a sub showing up too. Hopefully it doesn’t happen to me… Though actually, my first modeling gig was as a sub. That was back when I was still in Finland. My parents didn’t have enough models for their event.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> Oh, haven’t I told you? My parents are both fashion designers who put on some seriously extravagant shows.<br/>
<br/>
My perception of this character is flying into fucking orbit. This is somehow even less relatable than Rise or Naoto from 4.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> They jump from country to country, so I only really see them for half of the year. ...Maybe less these days.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a Persona protagonist in the making!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-081.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-082.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> Plus it would probably be tough being a phantom thief with my parents around, don’t you think? It was rough when I was little though… It was just me and our live-in caretaker. I didn’t really have any friends… Wow, that got dark fast…! Ahaha… Honestly, when I’m modeling… it almost feels like I’m connecting with my parents somehow. It’s a nice hobby to have… but I don’t think I’d want to make a living out of it. After all, that’s where Kamoshida first spotted me… and that’s how our class started those rumors...<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah, my parents are fashion designers, and I’m a model in high school… but it’s just, like, a hobby. Also I’m so preternaturally beautiful I’m constantly being victimized by the people around me.”<br/>
<br/>
And there’s kind of my issue with Ann. I just don’t feel like all this random shit they pile on in these scenes adds up to a whole character, something her Confidant is incredibly guilty of, which is why it’s one of the weaker ones overall.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> Besides, the Phantom Thieves are more important to me right now. Nobody can be my substitute there...<br/>
<br/>
(in forty-to-sixty updates in the future voice) I wouldn’t be so sure about that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> That’s why I need to get stronger!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Protag.png"/> <i>I sense a heightened motivation from Ann...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-083.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Ann.png"/> When I was little, I used to watch this anime where the main villain was this female thief. She’d lose to the hero every time, but I always thought she was cool. She wasn’t really a “good” person per se… But she was beautiful, strong, sincere, and even sexy. She always said whatever she wanted, did whatever she wanted… She knew what justice was for her. I… wanted to grow up to be just like her someday. I hope I’m getting closer now, if only just a little bit. Well, see you later.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-TV.jpg"/> People are out and about in the city, enjoying the early summer breeze. In the city, people can still escape and enjoy nature by visiting Inokashira Park...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Morgana.png"/> Hey, that park looks really nice. It might be a good idea to take a break and relax there.<br/>
