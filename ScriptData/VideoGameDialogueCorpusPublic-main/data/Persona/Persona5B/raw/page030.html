<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> I just can’t forgive Madarame, but what Ann said made me think… To Yusuke, are we just a bunch of thugs?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> I knew it… It ain’t like he thinks it is! Pisses me off just thinkin’ about it! Good people have to put up with so much crap while shitty adults do whatever they want. Makes me sick. I’m not wrong… am I?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Aww yeah! Don’t tell Ann I called you, by the way. Seriously. Well, see you tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Ryuji seems pumped. Good to know.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-AnnChat.png"/> Can you at least try to take this seriously?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-RyujiChat.png"/> Look, you don’t gotta go all out for this. You’re only doing it so you can get dirt on Madarame, remember?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-AnnChat.png"/> That is true. It sounds like Kitagawa-kun wants this to be a private picture of his though… Well, I guess I’ll let you guys know when he contacts me again.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Perfect. He prolly changed his plans immediately just so he could get you over there.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> We need to find out from Kitagawa-kun if what we saw in the Palace was true...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> Hey, quiet down. It’s that student council president.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Yikes… She got hold of Mishima today? It’d suck if she noticed us. C’mon, let’s split up.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> OK, see you later.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> C’mon, let’s get some dirt on Madarame. But man… Ann’s late.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> I was thinking about some things and didn’t notice how much time had passed.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Thinkin’ about what…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> Don’t you think Kitagawa-kun has to be protecting Madarame? I mean they live together, so he’d have to be aware of Madarame’s true nature. The only reason I can think for him doing that is that Madarame has something on him…<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe he’s in on it!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Yeah, that’s weird. But that’s why we’re goin’ to check it out, right? You ready to be a model?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> Yeah, I’m prepared.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Whaddya mean prepared? Prepared for what? Something seem different about her to you?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Ooh, nice eye!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> I didn’t cut them.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> H-Huh. Well… let’s get goin’.<br/>
<br/>
And so this mystery will go forever unsolved.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> We gotta talk to Yusuke.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> Kitagawa-kun seemed really happy when I agreed to be his model. Once he finishes drawing and gets a little friendlier, we should bring up Madarame.<br/>

<br/>
It’s amusing that Yusuke keeps getting upset that we’re showing up, but he should really be realizing by now that Ann is a Power-type Stand that can’t exist more than a few meters outside of our presence, and that joke was absolutely not worth the laborious effort it took to make even for the few of you who got it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> Wouldn’t you get nervous too, if it was just the two of us?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> We’re here to keep an eye on you, so don’t try anything perverted, ‘kay?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> Stop making such odd assumptions. I have absolutely no interest in her as someone of the opposite sex.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> Is there a problem?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> ...No, not really.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> Well then, let’s get started.<br/>
<br/>
About ten seconds later...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> Kitagawa-kun?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> …...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> You hear her?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> …...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> …It’s no use.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> This isn’t what we planned! We were gonna catch him off guard and make him spill his beans, weren’t we?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> How were we supposed to know this was gonna happen…? Guess we just gotta wait ‘til he’s done… What an effin’ pain in the ass...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> Perhaps I should try going outside this room...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> Heh, who do you think you’re talking to?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-017.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> It’s weird how flashy that door is… And… is that a lock? A door with a hefty lock… What could be in there?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> It’s no good…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> ...What?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> I’m sorry… Am I the problem?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> No, not at all. It’s just… I’m having trouble staying focused today. I’m sorry, but we’ll have to resume this another time...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> I’m sorry… We had another reason for seeing you today… We needed to talk to you.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> It’s about those rumors regarding your sensei.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> That painting I saw at the exhibit… You’re the one who actually painted it, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> That’s…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> I knew it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Your sensei’s seriously messed up. He just thinks of his pupils as tools. That’s why he doesn’t give a damn whether he steals their work or physically beats them. I’ll make this clear, there’s no point in hidin’ stuff from us.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> Hahaha… I have no idea what you’re talking about...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> You couldn’t go against him, could you? I’m sure we can help you out though…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> Stop it...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-023.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Maaku’s got the “!?” going on too, but we can’t see it due to the vignetting. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> Don’t misunderstand me though. I offered my ideas to him myself. As such, it can’t be called plagiarism. Sensei is simply suffering from artist’s block right now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Dude, still…!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> Kitagawa-kun...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Then why’re you stickin’ around!? All his other pupils ran away! Aren’t you the only one left!?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> There are no victims here! Stop pushing your self-centered righteousness on me!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> ……! I’m supporting Sensei as his pupil. Where’s the wrong in that?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-028.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> Then you leave me with no choice...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> I’m reporting you to the police.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> I asked Takamaki-san to be my model today, but I don’t recall ever calling you two here!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> What the eff, man!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> Ryuji! Stop it! Calm down, OK<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Dammit…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> I won’t report you… but only under one condition.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> What’s that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> I want you to continue being my model, Takamaki-san.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> But you said that it wasn’t working out today...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> That’s because I was unconsciously being modest for your sake… However, I have nothing to worry about anymore. If you’re willing to bare everything to me...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Uh-oh! Seems like the Phantom Thieves have gotten themselves into yet another wacky situation!<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> Of course, you two won’t be allowed in, and I ask that you forget about our discussion today, as well. If I don’t submit a new piece to Sensei soon, there will be some… inconveniences.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> Because those are my terms.<br/>
<br/>
Sweet blackmail, bro.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> But that’s--<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Wait, ain’t that bad!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> <i>(to himself)</i> Sensei is out during the afternoon while the art exhibit is on, so I can use this place freely… I should buy more art supplies...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> Will you give me a second here!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> Of course, I’m willing to wait. I’ll make time according to your plans. But, please come before the exhibit ends.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> No! That’s not what I mean! Why are you not listening…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Yusuke.png"/> Sensei will be returning home soon. We’re done for today. Takamaki-san. I’ll be waiting for you to contact me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> No no no! We are not done talking here!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Hey… What should we do?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-038.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Maaku is getting a headache from this shit.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Yeah… Dammit. He got us good this time.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> Don’t give up so easily!<br/>
<br/>
So, to recap: currently, a teenage girl who has been previously sexually harrased, trying to protest against a situation that also makes her uncomfortable sexually, is being completely ignored by the (otherwise sympathetic) character putting her in this situation, as well as her friends. This scene is kind of a clusterfuck of weird, bad decisions. But uh, hey, comedy!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-040.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-041.jpg"/><br/>

Ryuji bends down to pick Morgana up.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> How dare that Yusuke…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> The way he said it, it’s not gonna be semi, but full-on nude...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> F-Fu-- F-F-Full nudity…? Lady Ann’s gonna…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> Drop it!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> You know, you won’t have to worry about that if we make Madarame confess before the exhibit ends.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> But Kitagawa-kun thinks he owes his life to him. Is there a need to make Madarame confess?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> Then, Lady Ann… you’re fine with baring it all!?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Madarame’s no different from Kamoshida. That asshole’s usin’ Yusuke, who doesn’t have parents. You’re tellin’ me we should just ignore how he’s bein’ treated horribly like the other pupils?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> No… It is frustrating to leave this along, even if Kitagawa-kun is fine with it himself...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> You can’t leave it be because you’ve endured a lot yourself, with Kamoshida.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> ...Yeah.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Anyways, we gotta go after this guy. Madarame’s the kind of target we’ve been waiting for. Let’s help Yusuke come to his senses too… before he ends up like us.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> ...Right.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> We need to look into Madarame first.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> There might be tons more stuff that hasn’t been exposed yet, too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> It may become easier for us to investigate his Palace if he’s preoccupied with his exhibit.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> Also, there’s the thing about me modeling! Kitagawa-kun said there’d be “inconveniences” unless he submits a new piece. Maybe that’s going to be announced soon as Madarame’s next work...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-044.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-045.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> We must deal with Madarame, no matter what, before his exhibit ends!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Let’s start after school tomorrow. It’ll be a pain if Miss President finds us on the rooftop again, so where to meet up… Let’s see… I guess that walkway-like place in Shibuya would work. It’s near Madarame’s place, too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> …Changing our hideout periodically, huh? That’s a plan I don’t mind backing.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And just like that, our hideout has changed.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> ...Huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Ohya.png"/> From the looks of things, you don’t seem like the ordinary, stalking fans.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> Uh…<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Ohya.png"/> Oh, sorry. I should’ve been more clear. I’m actually looking for people that know Madarame’s pupils. There’s this painting, “Sayuri,” that was supposedly stolen in the past. But there’s this rumor that it was taken by one of his pupils in retaliation for being abused. Have you heard anything about that?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> I don’t know nothing!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Ohya.png"/> I see… There’s no case unless there’s a victim, and if there’s no proof of abuse… I can’t write either. Looks like I’m back to square one. Sorry for taking your time.<br/>

<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Mishima.png"/> You’re better off talking to him in person if you want specifics. All I know is his target is a terrible person. And that it might complicate things if he posted the name online. I’ll have him wait for you at Shibuya Station after school.<br/>
<br/>
Um, Mishima, why are you referring people to meet us <i>in person?</i> You’re new to this whole discretion thing, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Mishima.png"/> The guy’s name is “Nakanohara.”<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> Nakanohara… That’s Madarame’s student.<br/>
<br/>
Nakanohara! It seems like this can only be about one thing...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Mishima.png"/> I told him to approach you. Good luck.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-AnnChat.png"/> That journalist was looking into Madarame too. It could be real.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-RyujiChat.png"/> Someone died though. No one’s talking about it… I bet it was covered up. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-AnnChat.png"/> I wonder if Kitagawa-kun has heard anything… It’d be great if he could come help us out.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-RyujiChat.png"/> Ain’t that asking a bit much? After today, he’s prolly gonna be on edge about us. Well anyway, Madarame’s still a piece of crap! Let’s meet up tomorrow. It’ll be our first time at the new hideout.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-AnnChat.png"/> It’s that passageway in Shibuya, right? Got it. See you guys tomorrow.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> If the rumor Ryuji just spoke of is true, there have to be other victims...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-TV.jpg"/> This scandal has rocked the sports world—everyone ever involved with him is being pressed for answers. The volleyball association is currently considering banning him permanently, and...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> Drummed out of the volleyball association, eh? Well, he deserves it.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> We’re about to head to the hideout too. Who’s that…?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> That’s Nakanohara. Mishima told us to meet him here in Shibuya today.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> For real…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Nakanohara.png"/> ...My name is Nakanohara. Natsuhiko Nakanohara, the one who was posted about on the Phantom Aficionado Website.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> He seems pretty nice. Doesn’t seem like the stalker type. I think the change of heart must have worked.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Nakanohara.png"/> The administrator of that website contacted me… They told me to look for someone in a Shujin uniform with a cat...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> So? Whaddya want?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Nakanohara.png"/> You may have already heard, but there’s someone I wish to trigger a change of heart in. ...An artist by the name of Madarame.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Ooh, you think this is it? Is the pupil gonna confess his master’s secrets?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> His Shadow did mention Madarame as well...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Nakanohara.png"/> I’m… one of Madarame’s former pupils. He gave me lodging at his home, where I thought only about art. I genuinely wanted to be an artist… There was another pupil as well. A very talented man, multiple years my senior. Obviously, Madarame kept tabs on him. Everything he made was claimed as a Madarame original. He wasn’t the only victim though…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> All right, we got some real proof of the plagiarism.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Nakanohara.png"/> In response to Madarame’s actions… that senior pupil committed suicide.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Nakanohara.png"/> He must have been unable to bear seeing his work praised under Madarame’s name. That was when I disobeyed Madarame’s pleas and left. ...But he quickly pressured other parts of the art world, and my life as a painter was destroyed. I tried to turn over a new leaf working at a ward office… but it was no use. My attachment to art warped my emotions. Soon I began getting attached to everything… In the end, I even turned into a stalker… Ha… Haha…<br/>
<br/>
Nice supervillain origin story you got there.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Nakanohara.png"/> ...I’d like to ask again. Please, make Madarame have a change of heart. Not only for me. It’s… to save the life of another man as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Nakanohara.png"/> Even now, there is still one young man remaining under Madarame’s tutelage. I think he’s about your age.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> That has to be Yusuke.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Nakanohara.png"/> Not only is he a talented artist, he also owes Madarame for taking him in after his mother passed… He is the perfect target.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Nakanohara.png"/> I actually spoke to him a few times back when I was still living at Madarame’s. I asked him if he found it painful to stay with Madarame… and do you know what he said? “If I could leave, I would...”<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> Kitagawa-kun...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Nakanohara.png"/> I have no right to say this given my prior cowardice, but I don’t want to see another suicide…! I’d like to find a way to save this young man. He has a bright future ahead of him… Please consider that when thinking about changing Madarame’s heart.<br/>
<br/>
Nakanohara leaves. I guess he just knows we’re the fucking Phantom Thieves now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> It sounds like we don’t have the time to deliberate whether or not to change Madarame’s heart.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, let’s save the dude who’s blackmailing us!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Hell yeah! Madarame’s just a piece of shit who preys on the weak!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> Plus, we finally got to hear how Kitagawa-kun really feels!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> Well, since we’ve reached a unanimous decision, how about we continue this at our new hideout?<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> We all saw that Palace. We’ll pay dearly if we assume it’s just going to be like the last one. And furthermore… Lady Ann’s chastity is on the line!<br/>
<br/>
You know, I came into this update not thinking much of this weird plotline except that it was really silly and dumb and not that great, but these jokes are actually pushing me over the edge and now all I can think about is the word “regrettable.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-072.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> We’ll need to do what we did with Kamoshida. First, we secure an infiltration route in the Palace. After that, we send our calling card. Once the Treasure has materialized, we steal it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Oooh, I got a question! Madarame doesn’t know that we were doin’ stuff in the Palace yet. Why are we already gettin’ treated like criminals in there?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> You’re learning, Ryuji. Well done. It must be because he doesn’t trust anyone. Any unknown person may as well be an enemy.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> Or maybe he’s just super salty from all those rumors that have been spreading about him…<br/>
<br/>
I’m super salty that I just heard the words “super salty” in this motherfucking video game.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Then his Palace bein’ so crazy had nothing to do with us…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> Either way, we should stay on our best behavior. It’ll be harder for us to steal the Treasure if we needlessly increase the security level.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> We need to be careful of Kitagawa-kun this time too. I’m sure that whatever he sees will just get passed on to Madarame.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> That’s right!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> Hey, what is Madarame’s Treasure going to look like anyway? Another crown?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> I’d doubt that. But my sixth sense will know when I see it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ryuji.png"/> Oh yeah, you go completely nuts, huh.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> Our time limit is when the exhibit ends, right? That means… June 5th. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> We’ll carry out the plan after we’ve sent out the calling card. So, our infiltration route will need to be set in stone two days prior, on June 2nd.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Ann.png"/> Now listen here. We can’t mess this up, NO MATTER WHAT! OK!?<br/>
<br/>
Time to get to work.
