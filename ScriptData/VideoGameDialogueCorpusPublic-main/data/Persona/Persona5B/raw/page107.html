<br/>
We don’t even get Beneath the Mask this morning, because we’re supposed to be ~all sad Morgana’s gone~. Peh. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chatter.jpg"/> I heard my sister’s boyfriend’s friend got a calling card! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Murmur.jpg"/> Why don’t you put a request in to the Phantom Thieves? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Livingston.jpg"/> All he does is dump overtime on me while he dashes off right at five. I wish the Phantom Thieves would work their magic on him… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Root.jpg"/> What would that be like? If they changed his heart? <br/>
<br/>
Totally unrelated, but <i>man,</i> Stephen Root does not look 66 at all (and yes, I know he's only like 47 in this picture, shut up).<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Livingston.jpg"/> Well, they say you become the opposite of how you normally are. <br/>
<br/>
It’s like they get hypnotized or something.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Livingston.jpg"/> So I guess he’d become more open-minded, communicate better, and start taking initiative. He’d basically be as awesome as the president of Okumura Foods. ...Please, Phantom Thieves! Please, make this happen! <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-FutabaTankTop.png"/> If anything, getting into the real building is impossible… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-RyujiSummer.png"/> Mona seriously went to a Palace based on somewhere like this…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-MakotoSummer.png"/> It’s definitely on a different scale than the ones we’ve dealt with previously… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-RyujiSummer.png"/> I searched Okumura online. He’s totally up to something. <i>(to Maaku)</i> Don’t you think he’s guilty too? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-RyujiSummer.png"/> I’m positive I’m right! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-FutabaTankTop.png"/> We’re here for Mona. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-RyujiSummer.png"/> I know, I know. We gotta make sure we squeeze the juice on those mental shutdown things outta him too. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-MakotoSummer.png"/> You said you found the Palace keywords, right, Futaba?<br/>
<br/>
Wait, what? We’re skipping the usual “figure out the distortion” scene? I mean, it was generally pretty pointless, but it’s weird that we’re just offscreening these now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>...What!?</i> How the fuck did you figure that out!? We’re not even going to like, examine why he sees his workplace as <i>outer freaking space?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And after a single line of mild confusion, no one ever questions Okumura’s distortion again. Hell, hilariously, I’m not even sure we’ve heard the dude’s first name spoken aloud yet, and I’m pretty certain not a one of us knows what he looks like. Not that it wouldn’t be simple enough to find out, I’m just saying we’ve never met this dude, know pretty much nothing about him, but somehow when coming up with guesses for how his fucked-up brain sees the world we immediately jump to “outer space!” Sure, why not? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-AnnSummer.png"/> Ohhh, so that’s why it’s called Big Bang Burger. Big bang is space lingo, y’know. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-MakotoSummer.png"/> Um, not necessarily… <br/>
<br/>
I was wondering what the hell Makoto meant by this because almost all the Wikipedia disambiguation results for “Big Bang” are after (and thus most likely in reference to) the adoption of the Big Bang Theory (Bazinga). Then I noticed a weird one:<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-capture_003_23032018_121917.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Big_Bang.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
There’s no goddamn way this was intentional, but it’s still pretty great.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-MakotoSummer.png"/> So the concept behind the store-branch name came from the CEO himself.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-YusukeBlue.png"/> Outer space, hm? How exciting… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-RyujiSummer.png"/> We better be able to breathe once we get in there. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-009.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-011.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Y’know, maybe doing this in a public-yet-sparsely-populated area where we’re fully visible from far away the day after the building gained news attention for being the target of vandalism was a bad idea. We probably could have gone somewhere a little more inconspicuous and just like, walked over.<br/>
<br/>
But, uh… I guess Akechi’s here now! Oh boy! <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-MakotoQueen.png"/> President Okumura must be on guard, what with everything that’s been in the news. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-RyujiSkull.png"/> That bastard! He’s just causin’ more trouble for us! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Wait, what? That’s… confusing. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-YusukeFox.png"/> It’s as though we’re in a film… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-017.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-RyujiSkull.png"/> C’mon, we gotta get lookin’ for him. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Wait, we can see outside the front doors to a normal city, so we’re clearly in the lobby of the building. When did we get inside? Ann’s first line in the last cutscene would imply they teleported directly inside when they entered the Metaverse, which is… weird, because that’s never how it’s worked before. Also, if just being near the building is enough to suck us into the orbit (heh) of this Palace, where the hell did Akechi end up? <i>Also,</i> isn’t it like, <i>really fucking weird</i> that we can enter the Metaverse from Tokyo, walk over to this building, go inside, and see <i>the entire Earth</i> from within it? Or, to rephrase that question, what the hell? <br/>
<br/>
It also probably goes without question that the building is almost certainly one of those “bigger on the inside” deals, because <i>fuck, is this place massive.</i> That I have less of a problem with than the weird, mind-bending sense of geometry required to justify being able to walk from the Earth into outer space. Unless the front door to the Palace is like, a wormhole or something. Yeah, okay, let’s go with that. It’s pretty space-y.<br/>
<br/>
Also, since Morgana is obviously not here and thus has left my active party, I decide to sub in Yusuke for the sake of filling up the team. <span class="bbc-spoiler">He will not see combat.</span><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yusuke’s big fat character portrait is completely obscuring Makoto in this image, for the record. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaOracle.png"/> Let’s see here… Looks like a lever for the elevator to me. Aaand it should be working now! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-RyujiSkull.png"/> For real? You’re amazin’, Oracle. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaOracle.png"/> Mwehehe, that was nothing.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-MakotoQueen.png"/> It’s certainly reassuring having you with us. Anyway, let’s try using the elevator. <br/>
<br/>
First off, complimenting Futaba is how we got into this dumb Morgana mess in the first place, so maybe save it for now. Second, if Futaba had to jigger the elevator for it to operate, how could Morgana have possibly gotten any further than this? Shouldn’t we just assume he’s not here? <br/>
<br/>

Oh yeah, I’m really feeling the space theme with this featureless grey hallway. Wait, that’s not fair. There’s like, a space tree or something. Not totally featureless.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
It’s really weird to me that for this dialogue option there’s no “serious” option. Both of them make you seem like a huge dumbass for not realizing what’s happening immediately. The reason it comes off so strangely is that Japan has a very real phenomenon of “occupational sudden mortality” or “overwork death,” also known as <i>karōshi.</i> Now, most of the time this is due to heart attack, but a lot of cases are just straight-up suicides, which is unfortunately not terribly surprising considering Japan’s high suicide rate. It’s also a widespread problem in South Korea and China, which probably won’t surprise you. From the Wikipedia page on the subject, one of the four “typical” cases of karōshi according to the International Labour Organization includes a nurse who died at the age of <i>twenty-two</i> after being forced to work <i>thirty-four continuous hours… five times a month.</i> It’s fucked up. <br/>
<br/>
It’s <i>also</i> worth noting that due to government “encouragement” (read: they’re barely doing shit) for companies to limit the amount of hours an employee is “allowed” to work per week in response to some of these deaths, a lot of these hours are classified as unpaid (and often unrecorded) overtime, which companies have gone even further to limit by placing a monthly cap on overtime hours. However, due to incredibly stringent quotas and overbearing workloads, even employees who work at some of these companies can’t afford to take advantage of this and end up working at home or secretly staying at the office with the lights turned off, known as “cloaked overtime.” In 2007, Mitsubishi (a banking corporation, not the car manufacturer) instituted a policy allowing employees to go home up to three hours early to care for their families, and two years later only <i>thirty-four out of seven thousand</i> workers had taken advantage of this. And all this isn’t even getting into the societal expectation that salarymen go out drinking with their coworkers constantly. Yeah, that’s a real thing, anime didn’t make that up. <br/>
<br/>
Also I thought it was a little weird that these overwork claims were being pointed at a food service company, as the immediate thought when they’re brought up is not “salarymen,” but sure enough, according to <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/japan-has-a-word-for-working-to-death" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this Daily Beast article,</a> one of the worst companies in the country, as selected by a group of journalist and labor activists for their prestigious “Most Evil Corporation of The Year Award” is Mister Donut (they didn’t actually win that award to my knowledge, but the article mentions them as a serious contender).<br/>
<br/>
So, when I say, “maybe there should be a serious option here,” it’s in full acknowledgment of just how pervasive and toxic overwork is in Japanese society. But, uh, maybe the video game industry isn’t really in a position to be throwing stones there, so I guess I understand. All this makes for a rather morbid and serious last four paragraphs, though, so here’s an adorable dog dressed as a police officer!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Crime.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Aww! Isn’t he cute? And he’s got plenty of free time to play with you after being put on paid administrative leave following that “officer-involved shooting” of a man with “no active warrants”! Looks like this Crime Dog is gonna take a bite out of… (checks notes) ...black people.<br/>
<br/>
What were we talking about?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh, right.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-MakotoQueen.png"/> True, that’s what they appear to be externally. However, this is most likely how the workers of Okumura Foods are viewed by their CEO.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-AnnPanther.png"/> So he thinks they’re his robots!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-YusukeFox.png"/> If they’re being treated like this in reality as well… then the company truly is exploiting them. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-RyujiSkull.png"/> See!? Okumura IS a piece of shit! Just like I said.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaOracle.png"/> Mona is our main objective here. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-MakotoQueen.png"/> He doesn’t seem to be anywhere nearby. Let’s search further in. <br/>

Just up ahead, we come across a new room with some weird hologram in the center. We ignore it for now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Instead, we head to the door on the far side.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-YusukeFox.png"/> The door has closed. Is there any way by which we can open it? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>

Ryuji throws himself against the reinforced metal door that doesn’t even open outwards and is protected by a force field. He also kicks it for good measure. Brilliant plan. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-RyujiSkull.png"/> The hell’s up with this!?<br/>
<br/>
Well, for starters, you’re an idiot. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-MakotoQueen.png"/> Oh, that means Mona hasn’t been able to proceed any further either. So if he’s here in the Palace, he would have to be somewhere before this door…<br/>

...What? Oh! Hey, it’s Girl With Watering Can/Well-Behaved Girl! What’re you up to, buddy? Almost didn’t recognize you because you actually have a portrait this time! Guess you got bumped up to “recurring,” huh? Good for you!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-MakotoQueen.png"/> Those clothes… Could she be…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-AnnPanther.png"/> A black mask!? Wait, is she the one Madarame and Kaneshiro were talking about…!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-RyujiSkull.png"/> So… she’s the reason for all those people goin’ brain dead…!? It was a girl this whole time!? <br/>
<br/>
Oh, I guess… we don’t realize who it is yet? For some reason? Even though it’s totally obvious even from the second you first meet Girl With Watering Can that this character is going to be Important? Actually, scratch that, ever since the fucking fireworks cutscene where we actually first saw her? The same fireworks cutscene that was immediately followed by an insinuation that Makoto knew who that girl was, which never pays off and is in fact actively contradicted by this segment of the game? Hello?<br/>
<br/>
Like, come on Ryuji, you’ve met this girl twice now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-049.jpg"/><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-YusukeFox.png"/> Are you the one who has been following us!? <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-MorganaAngry.png"/> Long time no see, Panther. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-RyujiSkull.png"/> Uh, it hasn’t been that long. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-MorganaAngry.png"/> If you came for the Treasure, you should just go home with your tail between your legs. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-YusukeFox.png"/> Actually, we were looking for you. <br/>

<br/>
That’s… well… really dumb-sounding. Like, you might call her “<b>Beautiful</b> Thief” or the “Thief <b>of Beauty</b>,” but using “Beauty” like that as a proper adjective sounds incredibly fucking awkward, to the point I’m suspecting it’s yet another direct Japanese translation the localization team was forbidden from modifying. <br/>
<br/>
Upon my search, it turns out “Beauty Thief”’s Japanese pseudonym was “Bishoujo Kaitou,” bishoujo meaning roughly “beautiful girl” and Kaitou being the Japanese word for “phantom thief.” So yeah, it’s pretty literal. I’m still not sure why they didn’t choose “Beautiful,” an actual adjective, but whatever.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-MakotoQueen.png"/> Beauty Thief…? <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-YusukeBlue.png"/> We were told that she’s a Persona-user, correct? Do you believe it’s true? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-AnnSummer.png"/> Well, she did look like one… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-FutabaTankTop.png"/> Did Mona betray us…? <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-FutabaTankTop.png"/> Yeah…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-MakotoSummer.png"/> I don’t think he’s betrayed us. If he had, it’d make more sense for him to directly threaten us, such as exposing our identities. <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, except for the fact that the only human beings who can understand him (not counting the one he somehow managed to shanghai into this) are all in this fucking room. Maybe if he meows at the police long enough they’ll listen to him.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-YusukeBlue.png"/> Is she a student of Shujin? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-MakotoSummer.png"/> I just feel like that’s the case. She did have a mask on, after all. The registry in the student council room has photos of every student. Let’s check them all tomorrow. If we can figure out the identity of the Beauty Thief, that may help us regain contact with Morgana.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Protag.png"/> *nods*<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-YusukeBlue.png"/> Futaba and I should further probe into Okumura Foods then. It’d be best if we investigate how sudden mental shutdowns are connected to them. <br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a great idea, my man. I’m sure just poking your nose around will get you more information than the prosecutor we stole all that data from was able to uncover over a period of months.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-HaruGym.png"/> Things have grown quite serious lately… That’s why I want to make amends, even though it may only be for my own satisfaction. But I wonder if this is just running from the problem...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-MakotoSummer.png"/> Where did you meet Morgana?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-HaruGym.png"/> It was pure coincidence. I found a lonely-looking cat in front of our office building. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-MakotoSummer.png"/> And that was Morgana?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-HaruGym.png"/> Mm-hm. And when I followed him, I ended up in the Metaverse… <br/>
<br/>
So let me get this straight: After leaving the group in a huff, Morgana walked all the way to the Okumura Foods corporate headquarters in Roppongi. Not only did he somehow know exactly where this building was, he managed to get on and off the subway multiple times to get there. Then, by <i>sheer magical fucking coincidence,</i> he happens to run into <i>Haru, Okumura’s daughter and the only person who can get past the door in his Palace,</i> who decides to follow him for pretty much no reason. Then, he enters the Palace, pulling Haru in with him, despite the fact that however the hell he manages to switch between the real world and the Metaverse without using the app, it has never been established that he can bring other people with him. <br/>
<br/>
Sure, sounds plausible.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-HaruGym.png"/> There’s no way for me to change my father’s company… But if I became a phantom thief, I thought I’d at least be able to change him...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-MakotoSummer.png"/> ...Isn’t there any way we can work together?<br/>
<br/>
Haru shakes her head.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="148-114.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-HaruGym.png"/> What you’re doing is unnecessarily causing a stir among the public. Besides, the Phantom Thieves, who should be helping the weak, are not helping their own teammate.<br/>
<br/>
In our defense, he’s kind of an asshole.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="149-115.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="150-116.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Maaku and Makoto share a glance. Also, where the hell are Ann and Ryuji? If they already left then they probably would have also seen Haru before I did, and if they’re still inside they’re taking forever.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="151-117.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-HaruGym.png"/> And help Mona-chan, who gave me a chance to do just that. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-MakotoSummer.png"/> But aren’t our objectives the same? It’d be better if we work--<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="155-121.jpg"/><br/>

Gah! Sweet merciful Shylock! That fucking nose, dude! Should I… should I be showing this? Is this a hate crime? Man, this is unfortunate! <br/>
<br/>
Okay, yeah, I know this isn’t actually a Jewish thing, there’s no possible way it was intentional. But come on Soejima, this is just over-the-top. He looks like Robert De Niro in Raging Bull dressed up as Vincent Vega. He looks like Bucky Barnes, the suspicious new guardian of the Baudelaire orphans. Fuck it, he looks like Steve Carell in Foxcatcher trying to impersonate <i>me,</i> awful hair included.<br/>
<br/>
Also I looked up this dude’s VA because I didn’t recognize it and he’s done some notable stuff, like Kittan from Gurren Lagann, but most importantly, he’s <i>motherfucking Spandam from One Piece.</i> <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You know, that dude whose entire character design was Mankind but a total wimp and with the serial numbers filed off? This isn’t important or relevant in any way, it’s just all I can fucking hear now! This has been this update's installment of useless voice actor trivia only I care about!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="159-Okumura.png"/> ...That’s right. Make it a priority.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="159-Okumura.png"/> Phantom Thieves? Hmph…!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="161-125.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="162-HaruSummer.png"/> No, not at all… Um, what’s this about Phantom Thieves?<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="159-Okumura.png"/> It’s jealousy of the successful. Nothing but the barks of the masses who lack the resolve to sacrifice what’s needed for their well-being. Both the young and the old are overjoyed with some foolish idols. This country has no future.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, wow, this is certainly some dialogue.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="165-Writer.jpg"/> Hashino-san, please let me go home, I need to see my family.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="166-Katsura_Hashino.jpg"/> Not until you finish writing the rest of Okumura’s lines.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="165-Writer.jpg"/> Oh god, this character is such a flat boring caricature, what the hell am I gonna do? Well, maybe if I half-ass it he’ll just fire me. *bangs out the rest in two minutes* I’m done, sir. It’s not terribly subtle, but--<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="166-Katsura_Hashino.jpg"/> I love it! You’re promoted!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="165-Writer.jpg"/> Hot dog!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="167-128.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="159-Okumura.png"/> Are you still having doubts about me?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="162-HaruSummer.png"/> No…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="159-Okumura.png"/> More importantly, I hope things are going well with that young man.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="159-Okumura.png"/> He may not seem like it, but he’s still the son of an influential politician. Be cordial with him. He’ll eventually become a necessary connection for this company—or rather, for me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="162-HaruSummer.png"/> I understand… I will do the best I can.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="159-Okumura.png"/> Good. That’s how a daughter of Okumura should be. <br/>
<br/>
Remember how one scene ago I said this game’s cutscenes were weirdly directed? Well, in this scene Okumura sits down, crosses and uncrosses his legs multiple times, and then stands back up. It doesn’t really convey anything at all and kind of just seems like they thought the scene was too “static” so they had him move around pointlessly.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, it’s actually a really accurate and understated portrayal of ADHD, and I’m going to say it was absolutely intentional. Thank you, Katsura Hashino, for being such an understanding and empathetic artist.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="166-Katsura_Hashino.jpg"/> You’re welcome. Also, the gays are hilarious.<br/>

<b>Anon: we all agree on Okumura<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="171-Whisper.jpg"/> Why are the Phantom Thieves letting him go free?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chatter.jpg"/> What’s the point of that poll!? Hurry up and take him out already!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="171-Whisper.jpg"/> I’m disappointed. What kind of heroes are they?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Murmur.jpg"/> Just hurry up and send a calling card already.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-AnnChat.png"/> They were thanking us for resolving requests that we didn’t actually complete.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-RyujiChat.png"/> It’s prolly just a prank.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-YusukeChat.jpg"/> But those requests are indeed resolved. Someone must be going into Mementos other than us.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-AnnChat.png"/> I think it’s Morgana.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-FutabaChat.jpg"/> Agreed. He’s probably taking the Beauty Thief with him too. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-MakotoChat.jpg"/> We should look into this. I was thinking of persuading Okumura-san at school, but she’s been avoiding me.<br/>
<br/>
Wait, how is that possible? We confronted her today, and then we went home. How could she avoid you at school if she only met you at the end of the current school day? What the hell?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="174-134.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-AnnChat.png"/> I’m not sure how I feel about you saying that. I mean, we’re the Phantom Thieves…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-YusukeChat.jpg"/> The method is indeed a classic one, but it is a safe bet. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-AnnChat.png"/> Yeah, I think it’s better than just looking for them randomly.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-FutabaChat.jpg"/> I’m gonna have all sorts of snacks! No teachers to stop me on this field trip! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-RyujiChat.png"/> Welp, why don’t we get this over with?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Let’s do it tomorrow.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-TV.jpg"/> Former Okumura Foods employees have begun raising their voices in protest. Their complaints include unpaid overtime and health problems caused by overwork. Some protestors started to get violent outside their headquarters in a fierce dispute with police. It’s highly suspected that this protest is related to the window vandalism incident a few days ago.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Protag.png"/> <i>It sounds like a lot of people are protesting Okumura Foods.</i><br/>
<br/>
Wait, so did Morgana not vandalize the windows? But the vandalism was the entire reason we went to Okumura’s Palace! He was just there by coincidence? That’s bad writing!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="165-Writer.jpg"/> Wait, shit, I think there’s a plot hole here… Hmm… Fuck it, I’ll just do some more coke.<br/>
