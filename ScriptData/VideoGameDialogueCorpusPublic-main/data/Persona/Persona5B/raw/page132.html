Well, exams are done, time to rela--<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Boy_5.jpg"/> Yeah, seems like it’s for real this time. Apparently one of our students is a Phantom Thief. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Boy_6.jpg"/> Seriously!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Boy_5.jpg"/> I read the same thing online. Apparently Public Security is already on the move… <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Futaba!? You’re the Phantom Thief!?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-FutabaChat.jpg"/> There’s something I want to talk to everyone about. I’ll be at the hideout… I mean, our place. <br/>
<br/>
Oh.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-HaruChat.jpg"/> There’s still some time until we meet though, so I am going to go take care of my flowers first. See you later. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> I suppose plants do need watering, after all… Ah, I know. You should go help Haru, Maaku. I’ll let the others know. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-007.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-008.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruGym.png"/> You, um… heard that, didn’t you? I’m not worried about the garden, in case you were wondering. It’s just… so much has happened to me lately. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruGym.png"/> …… Well, perhaps I could share this with you… I mean, it would be nice to have someone who is aware of my current situation in life. The source of my worries is my father’s company. Dealing with the aftermath has been… difficult… Given how unexpected the accident was, my father didn’t have a will. All of his stocks transferred to me… Which means suddenly, I’m the biggest shareholder in a company of over one thousand employees. But… I don’t know the first thing about business direction or fund management… <br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a B-tier Disney Channel sitcom. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruGym.png"/> I am. Sorry, I didn’t mean to worry you. It’s just… I know I’m the president’s daughter, but I never thoughts I’d actually end up involved in company business… Because of that, I’ve been meeting with all the various officers and lawyers my father employed lately. They’ve been giving me advice on all the things I’m not entirely sure about. Assets, stocks… *shakes head* It’s clear some people only want to get on my good side though. I don’t know who I can trust… They try to sound comforting by saying things like “don’t worry,” or “leave it to me,” but… It feels like they’re really only being nice so they can get their hands on my bank account. I… I never realized I could be this distrustful of other people… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-capture_001_07062018_111755.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruGym.png"/> Ah, I’m sorry for ranting on about this matter. I feel as though doing so has helped me calm down a bit though. The only people I’ve consulted up to this point have been employees… But I think what I really needed was someone closer to my own age… closer to my own viewpoint. …… Um… if it isn’t too much trouble, could we speak about this again some other time? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Protag.png"/> *nods*<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruGym.png"/> In return, I’ll… Hm… What can I do to help you…? I don’t have any unique talents… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-capture_002_07062018_112211.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruGym.png"/> How about this? You know, gardening. I’m actually quite skilled at it. A few years ago I even managed to grow a tropical fruit on the balcony at my house… To be honest… this is what I do when I’m alone to take my mind off of everything that’s happened… …… Oh, that’s right. I stored some vegetables in the refrigerator down in the home economics room. ...You still have some time, yes? Would you mind waiting here a moment? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruGym.png"/> There’s not much consistency to their colors or shapes, but… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruGym.png"/> *giggle* You like vegetables, Maaku-kun? That’s good to know. ...But to tell the truth, I have a favor to ask of you. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruGym.png"/> I’d like to get Sakura-san’s opinion on my vegetables.<br/>
<br/>
Have you even met Sojiro? I mean, I guess you must have talked to him once or twice on the way to the hideout, but we never saw any of that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruGym.png"/> Do you think I could bring my next harvest over to your cafe? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruGym.png"/> Thank you. I’m sure Sakura-san will give me his honest opinion. I’ll make sure this next harvest is particularly good. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Protag.png"/> *nods*<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruGym.png"/> Well then, shall we head over to the hideout?<br/>
<br/>
So, despite all that dialogue and Haru’s promise of aid, we have <i>not</i> formed a Confidant yet. A bit annoying, but whatever. Also we never actually ended up helping Haru, oops.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ryuji.png"/> *sigh* I think I’m screwed for real this time. I couldn’t concentrate at all… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-017.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The same speechgiver from the other day continues outside.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Ann.png"/> More importantly, what’s this you want to talk about? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Haru.png"/> You said that something was on your mind before, but were you able to figure out what it was? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-FutabaJacket.png"/> The Medjed that I banned… wasn’t the real one. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ryuji.png"/> Huh? Aren’t you the real one though? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-FutabaJacket.png"/> Oh, uhh… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-021.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-FutabaJacket.png"/> The code written by that guy the other day is different from any of the past Medjed. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-FutabaJacket.png"/> A code is like your fingerprints. No matter how you try to disguise it, your own quirks appear in it. The one from the other day was all cut and pasted with no consistency. No skill at all. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> But aren’t there multiple people across the world that are part of Medjed? Couldn’t it have been done by someone that joined recently? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-FutabaJacket.png"/> How do I put it…? That code was so not done by anyone interested in cracking. At all. At the very least, there’s no way it was an official Medjed member. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Yusuke.png"/> So someone used the Medjed name to provoke the Phantom Thieves…? For what purpose? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Ann.png"/> Could they have been doing it for fun…? It was around the time our group started getting popular, so maybe they wanted in on the hype… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> Wait a moment. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-025.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Haru.png"/> Hm? <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> Perhaps they used the Medjed name to make the Phantom Thieves known… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ryuji.png"/> What? That makes no sense. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-FutabaJacket.png"/> I actually thought the same as Makoto. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Ann.png"/> Why’s that? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-FutabaJacket.png"/> Know how I just said that code is like fingerprints? I found those same fingerprints somewhere completely different. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Yusuke.png"/> Where’s that?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It was Mishima! I knew it! You son of a bitch!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-FutabaJacket.png"/> There were traces of it being illegally tampered with from the outside.<br/>
<br/>
Oh.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ryuji.png"/> For real…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-FutabaJacket.png"/> Before summer vacation, the access counter was made to be much higher than the actual number. Same with the rankings. Particularly the time when President Okumura ranked first. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Haru.png"/> So then, the one who provoked the group and the one who tampered with the site are the same person? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> ...I think I’m starting to see the big picture. Both Medjed’s provocation and the tampering of the website brought attention to us as a result. On top of that, our reason for targeting Okumura was influenced by the public and the rankings… The perfect timing, and the perfect target. If both of those had been set up… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Yusuke.png"/> ...It would all make sense. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Ann.png"/> No way… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> This is all hypothetical. We lack any hard evidence… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-MorganaShocked.png"/> But if all your deductions happen to be correct… That would mean we’ve been playing right into their hand for the past two months or so… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ryuji.png"/> W-We gotta be overthinkin’ things. I mean, we’re talkin’ both the rankings AND Medjed…! Everyone made a big deal about it! If this was all set up… Then… what kind of guy did we make an enemy of…? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The group takes a moment to ruminate on this.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Yusuke.png"/> ...There’s no point in getting anxious over speculation. Regardless, we’ll be falsely charged at this rate, and with murder. We must overcome this. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Haru.png"/> But, we don’t even know who we’re up against… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ryuji.png"/> Hey… you think we’re fallin’ into another trap, even at this very moment? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> Yeah. This doesn’t mean that we’ve lost yet. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> Even if this is the actions of a meticulous enemy, we’ll just have to get back at them. We need to find clues… No matter what. <br/>
<br/>
The group nods.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sae.png"/> I was told you recommended this reassignment yourself, sir. Why would you choose someone as inexperienced as myself…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-SIU_Director.png"/> When the case of the Shujin principal was ruled a suicide, you thought to reopen it… And you proved its connection to the Phantom Thieves. This is based primarily on that achievement. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sae.png"/> ...I’m honored, sir. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-SIU_Director.png"/> The Phantom Thieves issue is now a national crisis. Expectations are exceedingly high for us public prosecutors, as we are the executors of justice. Personnel and planning will be up to you on this case. You will also have the police under your command. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-capture_003_07062018_124442.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-SIU_Director.png"/> I’d like you to oversee this operation. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sae.png"/> <i>(in disbelief)</i> …….<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-SIU_Director.png"/> You’ve yet to give an answer… Will you accept the task of eradicating the Phantom Thieves? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sae.png"/> I will give it everything I have. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-SIU_Director.png"/> We’ll have to prepare a higher position for you as well in the event that you succeed. I don’t wish to apply extra pressure on you… But I assume your odds of success are high. Naturally, failure to accomplish this task is unacceptable… Do you understand? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sae.png"/> Of course! I will live up to your expectations, no matter what it takes! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-SIU_Director.png"/> That is all then. I expect good results from you. <br/>
<br/>
Welp, we’re boned, the SIU is after us. ...Wait, what is the SIU and what exactly do they do? It’s not really clear, game.<br/>
<br/>
According to a quick Google, the “Special Investigation Teams” (SIT) are groups of specialized detectives armed with cutting-edge technology and tactics to capture criminals in serious and often lethal cases such as bombings, aircraft hijackings, and kidnappings. So uh, a bunch of supercops with all the gear, weapons, and training they need to find us and kick our shit in. Great. The SIU in P5 is, I guess, a fictionalized version of this, though they don’t seem to actually <i>do anything</i> as of yet and their director is not just hopelessly corrupt but an active member of a political conspiracy. So just like real life! I also have no idea why Sae, a public prosecutor, seems to answer directly to this chucklefuck, but whatever. <br/>
<br/>
I also just learned that Japanese prosecutors have the ability to direct police for investigation purposes and conduct investigations themselves, Ace Attorney-style. I guess that series was even more accurate than I give it credit for.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> Should I warm up dinner for you? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sae.png"/> No, it’s OK. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sae.png"/> No need. I just came home to get a change of clothes.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> Are you going to stay at work then? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sae.png"/> I’ve been entrusted with a very important task. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> You look awful though… Aren’t you tired? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sae.png"/> As an adult, there will be times when you will accept an assignment for which failure will not be tolerated. It’s all over for me if I can’t win this. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> Still, if you were to collapse from exhaustion… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sae.png"/> …… I heard detectives have been coming to your school. That must make it hard to focus on your studies. Don’t worry though. It will all be over soon. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> What do you mean…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sae.png"/> I’m going to catch the Phantom Thieves myself.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> Is that the important task you mentioned? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sae.png"/> It’s none of your concern. <br/>
<br/>
Sae then immediately turns around and walks back into the black void directly outside the front door. Didn’t she need a change of clothes?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> Sis has her sights set on the Phantom Thieves… and on Shujin Academy in particular… This is bad… I need to let everyone know…!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Just try to stay calm.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-HaruChat.jpg"/> What’s wrong?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Sis told me she’s been entrusted with an important task regarding the Phantom Thieves.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-AnnChat.png"/> Wait, weren’t they already investigating us though?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-MakotoChat.jpg"/> The police were doing so in secret. This operation is on a much different scale. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-RyujiChat.png"/> Hold on a sec. What’s this SIU thing anyways?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-MakotoChat.jpg"/> The Special Investigations Unit. An elite team that deals with huge cases like government scandals.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-YusukeChat.jpg"/> I have heard that name on the news. They make headlines often.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-FutabaChat.jpg"/> The real insane part is, they haven’t lost a case against a suspect in like fifty years. If they come after you, you’re screwed. They’re the best investigation force in Japan.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-HaruChat.jpg"/> Are we going to be arrested…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Hm, doesn’t this countermeasure seem somewhat extreme? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Right or wrong, I think we’re just way too famous at this point. As this is a country governed by laws, they can’t afford to ignore us for any longer.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-HaruChat.jpg"/> We may be the Phantom Thieves… but this is miserable… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-FutabaChat.jpg"/> They probably have a pretty narrow suspect profile by now too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-RyujiChat.png"/> Hey, don’t scare us like that! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-FutabaChat.jpg"/> It’s OK though. They don’t have any evidence. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Yes, I expect they’re frantically searching for some as we speak.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-FutabaChat.jpg"/> No way they’re gonna find anything though.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-MakotoChat.jpg"/> It’s only a matter of time. We have to hurry and do something about this… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-MorganaSquint.png"/> ...E-Everything’s going to be fine. Unless they know about the Metaverse, there’s no way they’ll get any info on us.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yeah,</i> it’d <i>really</i> suck if that was the case! <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-Nice_Detective.jpg"/> Ah yes, you’re the one currently under probation. It says here you had a dispute with Mr. Kamoshida?<br/>

<br/>
Well, they weren’t asking very good questions, if so! One of them was about an event specific to me (and Ryuji), another was about who I hang out with (which the cop <i>answered for me</i>), and the last was just asking me to speculate. How would they have caught a lie? I wasn’t given much of an opportunity to lie in the first place! Also it completely torpedoes the premise that we were all asked the same questions, but whatever.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-FutabaJacket.png"/> I hope you didn’t. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ryuji.png"/> ...It was prolly fine. I woulda been done for if they saw how sweaty my hands were though. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Ann.png"/> Not to me… He looked like someone who’s dealt with dangerous criminals. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> I’m sorry for all of this… It’s because of my sister… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Haru.png"/> That’s not true, Mako-chan. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> It’s not as though I hadn’t predicted this would happen… But now that it’s become reality, I’m unsure of what to do… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> We need to make sure we don’t draw suspicion, and work to clear our names… right? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> ...Right. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ryuji.png"/> It ain’t your fault, Makoto. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-FutabaJacket.png"/> I’m gonna try to see how far along this investigation really is. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Ann.png"/> I’m worried about the police too, but as of now, anyone in this city could be a mole… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-FutabaJacket.png"/> We were so popular too… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> Haru, can I ask you to search your father’s belongings for clues about a possible culprit? I… I know it may be tough on you… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Haru.png"/> No, it’s OK. Now isn’t the time for me to look away. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> As for everyone else, you need to be cautious of how you spend your time at school. So, I’ve decided to have you three second-years join me on the school festival executive committee. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> It will allow us to gather without drawing suspicion. Plus, trying to blend in will only do the opposite. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ryuji.png"/> Ugh… Fine. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Ann.png"/> I agree. The more time I have to kill, the more time I’ll spend worrying about all this stuff. No matter what happens… I don’t want to regret my decisions. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ryuji.png"/> Don’t jinx it! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Yusuke.png"/> It would be no surprise if they came directly to our homes for questioning. They showed up at your school, after all… I should remain cautious. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-MorganaAngry.png"/> For now, the best option is to stay on the defensive… but we won’t make progress at this rate. Let’s try and figure out who the real culprit is somehow, OK? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> Of course… ……<br/>
<br/>
Makoto looks around the room at everyone, and then nods. The rest of the group then nods as well.<br/>

Somebody needs to give this guy a fuckin’ Snidely Whipdash mustache for him to twirl with his finger. I feel pretty confident saying this is the least compelling, most thinly-sketched character in the entire game if you only count people with portraits. Kamoshida was pure evil, too, but he was a <i>real</i> kind of evil. Hell, it’s implied Madarame and Okumura seemed to have some genuine affection for Yusuke and Haru, and even fucking Kaneshiro at least had the thin layer of insecurity revealed in his Palace. This motherfucker just seems like he should be tying helpless damsels to the railroad tracks in between bulldozing orphanages to make room for his oil drills. No, you know what? That’s not right. This obsequious shithead couldn’t massage his nuts without prior written instructions, so forgive me for presuming he could show some goddamn initiative. The only things he’s done in the entire game so far is be sexist at Sae and chuckle evilly at the magnificence of this <i>dreadful</i> plot to exterminate the Phantom Thieves. This character is such a lame plot device that despite him being the sole face of the conspiracy for most of the game and one of like three characters Sae interacts with to any real frequency, they never actually give him a name. It’s like Hashino <i>knew.</i><br/>

This game doesn’t contain nearly enough gratuitous sexual assault for an episode of Criminal Minds, sorry.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> The acts of thievery committed by the Phantom Thieves are mere fakes.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Ann.png"/> *sigh* So now they’re accusing us of being a bunch of killers…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ryuji.png"/> This is so effin’ stupid! Dammit!<br/>
<br/>
Don’t worry, Ryuji. I say “fuck” enough for the both of us. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-082.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> First place is Goro Akechi. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ryuji.png"/> What!? Akechi…!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Ann.png"/> What’re you so surprised for? We’ve been mentioning him this whole time. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ryuji.png"/> Seriously? Not some singer or an idol? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-MorganaAngry.png"/> It’s because of us that his popularity has skyrocketed. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ryuji.png"/> We’re the ones countin’ the results! Can’t we just make ‘em up? We don’t hafta get him…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> People will figure that out. He won by a landslide…<br/>
<br/>
I mean, he’s probably busy, right? Also we have no way of contacting him. I think it’s pretty unlikely in the first place that we get him.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Ann.png"/> I knew people would vote for him, but this is way more votes than I was expecting. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> It would be best for us to avoid inviting such a clear danger upon ourselves… I’d like a little more time to think about who to ask… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Haru.png"/> That reminds me… how is Futaba-chan doing? She seemed like she was looking into something on her own… Has she told you anything? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-083.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Haru.png"/> It’s not that I don’t trust her, but… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto.png"/> Even one clue would work wonders for us. We should let her continue with her own investigation. I hope she finds something… <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="125-Goro.png"/> However… I believe the recent series of suspicious deaths is unrelated to their actions. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="126-Cute_Announcer.jpg"/> Wh-What!? Did I hear you correctly? But Akechi-san, you were the first to caution everyone about the Phantom Thieves… were you not? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="125-Goro.png"/> This doesn’t change the fact that they are indeed a dangerous group. That said, I would like to express that immediately linking them to this case is far too hasty. There are still many questions to be answered here… It feels as though there is more to this. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-TV.jpg"/> After this conference, Akechi-san announced he will be limiting his media appearances and--<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Let’s meet up and discuss our options as soon as possible. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-RyujiChat.png"/> Tomorrow? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-AnnChat.png"/> The earlier the better, right? Though I still haven’t come up with anything myself… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-YusukeChat.jpg"/> It’s said two heads are better than one, so I can only imagine what eight heads may produce.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-HaruChat.jpg"/> That’s a good way of thinking.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-FutabaChat.jpg"/> It’s totally an Inari idea.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-MakotoChat.jpg"/> OK, let’s do everything we can right now. Even if it means crossing some dangerous bridges. Considering how far we’ve come, we can’t be particular about our methodology…<br/>

However, it is unclear if they found any clues, and unease among citizens is at its peak. The government has been criticized by the public for allowing such a dangerous group to run free… <br/>

I believed that with my skills, I could overcome being treated like an idol. ...There’s nothing I can say about my mother. You didn’t abandon me, even after you learned about the fixed matches… ...Now I know how encouraging it feels to have someone believe in you. At first, this was just a deal… You help me develop new moves and I give you shogi lessons. But before I knew it, you became… someone I couldn’t do without. I’m not gonna pay attention to all the criticism anymore. <br/>

Togo System lets us do the ol’ party swap on anyone’s turn now, which is great because Maaku’s turns are generally too powerful to waste. <br/>

Hifumi is one of the better Confidants and ultimately one of my favorite characters in this game. She’s just full of charm. She’s voiced by Eden Riegel, who voiced Marie in Persona 4 Golden, and I did not recognize her until I looked it up just now! Fun fact: Eden is the sister of Sam Riegel, who is the current voice of Teddie! <br/>
