<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Haughty.png"/> Do not close your heart in shame of your ignorance. Truth shines its light on open minds. In essence, there are two kinds of thieves: the Robin Hood figures, and the mere criminals. Thieves like Robin Hood rebel against authority. The Phantom Thieves only target individuals. And so, the Phantom Thieves are nothing more than criminals. It’d be best you remember that.<br/>

Today they’re selling two Uji Matcha Flan for 2980 yen, gifts you can give to female Confidants to rank them up faster on off days. They’re pretty pointless but we buy them anyway because we’re flush with cash.<br/>

I totally didn’t forget our weekly purchase of special drink and have to rerecord this entire update, no sir. Anyway, what’s with this game and the word “nasty” lately?<br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Guts+1</b>.<br/>
<br/>
Now, we have pretty much no options left today but to send the calling card. No one’s available today due to stat locks (Death) or because we haven’t sent the calling card (the entire rest of the party), so let’s just do that.<br/>

...And again.<br/>
<br/>

I have permission from my school, but it’s still tough to do both. ...Ah, I can’t keep complaining. Well, let’s both do our best today.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Chouno.png"/> Oh yeah. In Japan, when the rainy season ends, we say that it “opens.” But in English, it’s more common to hear people say the rainy season “closes.” Be careful!<br/>
<br/>
I’ve never heard it either of those ways, but okay!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Chouno.png"/> Expressions for the weather are totally different depending on what country you’re in. Now then… Mr. Hamiru! In English, what does the term “cat-and-dog weather” refer to?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Not to be confused with David Cage’s “masterpiece.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Chouno.png"/> That’s right! Raining cats and dogs. The strongest theory for its origin is that the sound of rain resembles that of dogs and cats fighting. Some other European languages describe bad weather as “dog’s weather,” too. <br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Knowledge +1</b>.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Chouno.png"/> Additionally, in Norwegian they say it’s raining witches, and in Polish they say it’s raining frogs.<br/>
<br/>
Gonna be honest, being a Norwegian sounds hilarious.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Chouno.png"/> Just to say “heavy rain,” as many things fall as there are countries in the world.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Morgana.png"/> Oh yeah, over here they say that when a cat washes its face, it rains. I clean my face every day because I like being clean, and lemme tell you, that’s a load of bull.<br/>

<br/>
This guy is named “Menacing Man,” but his voice actor is stuttering and playing it like he’s quietly freaking out this entire scene.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Kaneshiro.png"/> Hm? Read it.<br/>
<br/>
This is really weird. As far as Kaneshiro knows this is some kind of ad. Why would he care what’s on it?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Menacing_Man.jpg"/> Um, but...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Kaneshiro.png"/> I said, read it!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yep. Not greed, gluttony. All you people who guessed it was greed were off-base. Now, part of it is that this game’s conception of the sins is kind of warped, but if I squint real hard I can sort of see where they’re coming from, considering Kaneshiro is all about hoarding, rather than actually consuming and depriving. They still have to explain it a bit with that “money-devouring” line though.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Menacing_Man.jpg"/> “You indulge in scamming others with horrendous methods that target minors exclusively.

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-AnnSummer.png"/> We’re going up against a truly horrible criminal this time…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-RyujiSummer.png"/> That dick ain’t gonna stop us now that we got our awesome new member! Makoto! You remember how all this works?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-MakotoSummer.png"/> Once we steal the Treasure, the Palace will crumble and the Palace ruler’s heart will change.<br/>

<br/>
For today, we’ll be using Ryuji, Morgana, and Makoto. We want both Morgana and Makoto for healing, but as for why we’re using Ryuji over Yusuke… well, Ryuji has Tarukaja, which is great, but there’s one more reason. We’ll get into that later.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-034.jpg"/><br/>

Here’s what was in that chest we couldn’t open. A Revenge Mirror replicates Yusuke’s Counter and a Chewing Soul gives 100 SP. I don’t consider this terribly worth it, so I reload after opening it.<br/>

<br/>
Okay, so the explanation of “Bael” is a little complicated. Bael, or “Baal,” was a goetic prince of Hell. This version, however, is a lot closer to the similar (or identical, based on your source) figure Beelzebub, which means “Lord of the Flies” (yes, that is where the name of that book came from). German bishop and theologian Peter Binsfield’s classification of demons associated Beelzebub with the deadly sin of gluttony, and here we are. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
For this fight we’ll be using pretty much unfailingly the Flauros Ari fused. We might switch to Matador once or twice for Media, but it’s one of our best Physical attackers, and it knows Tarukaja and Rakunda.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Bael gets two actions, but his health pool is rather tiny. He’ll start generally by using Evil Touch to inflict Fear, and attack physically. Makoto’s Energy Shower gets rid of Fear easily enough, so it’s nothing to worry about.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Bael.jpg"/> No more games then. I ain’t gonna forgive yeh punks for this.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-MakotoQueen.png"/> That’s our line! You had better be prepared!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
He can also use Eiga or Maeiga to inflict Curse damage. It’s still rather pathetic unless you have a Curse-weak Persona equipped.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Morgana.png"/> Dammit…! I didn’t expect he’d have something like this up his sleeve!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-MakotoQueen.png"/> Joker! Make sure you have us regroup if you think we’re at a disadvantage! That thing’s a giant… If it attacks us while we’re at low stamina, we won’t survive!<br/>
<br/>
We’re now in the meat of this fight. And before we really get into it, I should say: this is the easiest boss in the game. That’s not to say it’s impossible to die, but once you know how to deal with his bullshit he’s trivial to counter, and some of his moves seem just designed for Makoto to handle. Sure, I had less trouble with Kamoshida, but that’s as a veteran Persona player who knows about debuffs and had a Persona selection to complement that. Here, we’re just using Flauros, because we don’t have a Persona with Tarunda and to take advantage of his Rakunda and great Strength (Evade Phys and his null Fire affinity also help a lot). Tarunda would be really nice to have, because this boss does, admittedly, hit like a truck. Perhaps we should have upgraded our frankly pretty shitty armor, though he does shitloads of damage even to Makoto, who starts with better gear than any of us have. But as long as we got Morgana to level 24 for Diarama, and brought both him and Makoto, we’re fucking golden. I said Media was useless recently, and that’s not entirely true. It’s still useful to have someone topping up multiple people with low health just in case. Diarama is still going to be our bread and butter though. <br/>
<br/>
For some context: I fought this boss four times (which will explain why the screenshots differ so heavily from the video). The first time I actually killed him <i>too quickly</i> and had to reload so I could show more of the fight, the second time is the take you’ll see in the video, the third time was because I realized I forgot to buy that fucking aojiru and had to rerecord, and the fourth time was to test some stuff I hadn’t tried for the purpose of better explaining the fight.<br/>

Piggytron is now spinning, preparing to roll into us. We keep attacking it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
On the next turn, it begins spinning even faster. It’s definitely about to hit us, and attacking it didn’t make it stop.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
On the next turn...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-081.jpg"/>\<br/>
<br/>
Yikes.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-113.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Now, you may be thinking, “I’ll just guard that attack. That’s why they give you two turns to prepare, right?” And that’s one way to deal with that… though I can’t recommend it. In my infinite wisdom, on the fourth attempt I mentioned earlier, I thought to see if it was possible to survive being steamrolled by guarding. Well, it is. But only just barely. It does upwards of ~400 damage to each party member, and guarding should about halve that. Let’s look at Morgana, who has both the lowest HP and the lowest Endurance in the party. He currently, at level 25, has 240 HP. Unguarded, it did about <i>550 to him vs 400 for the others</i>. Now, while the other party members were able to guard and survive with HP that didn’t even approach the critical range, from about 80-120 left (and that 80 wasn’t even from full health), Morgana was left with only <i>sixteen.</i> Considering Morgana is critical to trivializing this fight (unless you want to bring Yusuke or Ann instead and make Joker the other primary healer, which would take a lot longer still because that’s way less Rakunda going out), and he only barely manages to survive even while guarding, I don’t think it’s a viable strategy, especially because you probably won’t be at full health for that attack and RNG may very well determine if he survives it at all. Again, you could probably Tarunda this, but I didn’t have that option, and while Rakukaja from Makoto is great, it only affects one person (and Makoto should probably be healing anyway).<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-082.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
So, what do you do? Well, you can try to guard the first one and wait for the game to tell you what to do on the next use of Super VIP Form… or if you press left or right on the D-pad, you can switch targets to Kaneshiro, who has quietly become targetable. I forgive you if you didn’t notice this, because <i>he’s barely fucking visible.</i> <br/>
<br/>
Let’s do that instead.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-083.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Kaneshiro, with his HP pool reduced even further, gets knocked off in a few hits.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="111-084.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-085.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He is then flattened by Piggytron when it rolls over him. Now, as Kaneshiro is not the real boss here, this is completely meaningless in terms of progression, but it’s kind of funny I guess.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="113-086.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
He then gets back inside.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="114-087.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Missile Party deals considerable Fire damage to the entire party (which is why we didn’t bring Yusuke) and has a chance to inflict Burn.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-089.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Morgana.png"/> What’s the plan? Should we knock him off like earlier, or do you want to find another way out?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="117-090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Morgana.png"/> As you know, Kaneshiro is a money monger. Tossing an expensive item his way might draw his attention and serve as a distraction…! Let’s give it a try, Joker! It’s your call what item we throw!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-RyujiSkull.png"/> All right, Joker! Time to get that bastard lookin’ over here!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="118-091.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This is the single most worthless one of these special actions in the game, and the one most people cite when saying the mechanic feels half-baked.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-092.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-093.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-094.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
A few things here: I have no idea how the game decides what is and is not an acceptable item. All I know is that there’s no point in ever trying any of the “I’m not sure” items, because to my knowledge they always fail. Here, Ryuji will always provide an item that will pique Bael’s interest, but I don’t know why some items are in the pool and some aren’t. One time, one of the “bad” items was a fucking Soul Food, an item that completely restores your SP. Another time, one of the cheap items was a Recover Oil, an item that serves the exact same function as a Hiranya (curing all status effects on one ally), which is in the “expensive” pool. My only guess is that it’s based on how much the item sells for.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, I’m not willing to part with a Hiranya, so I use Morgana’s Life Stone.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-095.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="123-096.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Morgana.png"/> Ngh, he’s not interested at all… Do we need to use something worth a little more…?<br/>
<br/>
It doesn’t work.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="124-097.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Bael.jpg"/> My Piggytron’s gonna lose…? No, that’s impossible!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-MakotoQueen.png"/> It’s already been decided… You are going down.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="125-098.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="126-099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This has a chance to inflict the entire party with Fear. It’s also gross. As my good friend Freakazoid once said, “I don’t wanna go down into the sewer. It smells like poo gas.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="127-100.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="128-101.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
On the next go around, we get a Magic Ointment (reflects one magic attack). What the hell, let’s throw it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="129-102.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="130-103.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="131-104.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="132-105.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="133-106.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Bael.jpg"/> Th-This’ll make us a fortune! Damn good find, yo!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Morgana.png"/> D-Did it work…!? We don’t need to worry about getting rushed now! Nice work, Joker!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="134-107.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Bael.jpg"/> Maybe I can pick up a girl or two once I pawn this thing off...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Morgana.png"/> Kaneshiro’s completely engrossed… Attack him while he’s off guard! It’s only right that a money monger like him is destroyed by money!<br/>
<br/>
It only incapacitates Bael for two turns, after which he’ll go right back to attacking. If you’re really getting your ass kicked, I guess it might be handy, but otherwise there’s absolutely no reason to bother with throwing an item. It’s just a waste.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="135-108.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="136-109.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And that’s Bael down.<br/>

Morgana learns Garula to replace Garu.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="138-111.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ann learns Fire Break, a pretty much worthless skill that negates Fire resistance (except the skill Fire Wall, which adds Fire resistance). On Ann, it’s not quite as bad as usual because she lacks any source of damage outside of Fire, but Break skills are hot garbage across the board. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="139-112.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Finally, Yusuke learns Mind Slice, which deals Medium Physical damage to all enemies with a low chance of Confuse.
