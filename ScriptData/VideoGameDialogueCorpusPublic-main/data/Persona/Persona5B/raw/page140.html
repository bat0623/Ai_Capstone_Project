Why not read the fishing book, even if we’ll probably never go back there?<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> It’s a book about fishing, but it talks more about fishing gear and ideal mental states than fish. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> I never thought there’d be ways to tell different types of fish apart while they’re underwater… We should go to the fishing pond sometime and test what you’ve learned! <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Inui.png"/> There were those incidents in April, then the Phantom Thieves and the principal… *sigh* <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Uhhh… <sub>did he just fucking say that?</sub><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Inui.png"/> Perhaps you’re wondering why I used such hip terminology, hm? <br/>
<br/>
Oh god, please kill me.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Inui.png"/> Now then, Hamiru-kun. The word “wack” was also used in a coded language from history. What was that language? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It’s the only answer at all relevant to the game, shockingly.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Inui.png"/> Correct. If you knew that offhand, then I daresay you must be pretty wack, yourself.<br/>
<br/>
I’m gonna jump out the window out of sheer mortification. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Inui.png"/> ...I’m joking, of course. Still, you must be quite diligent in your studies. To thieves of olden days, wack was actually a noun, meaning one’s fair share. If you wanted your part of a haul of riches your group stole, you would demand your wack, you see. <br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Knowledge +1</b>. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Inui.png"/> If today’s youth are freely using Thieves’ Cant to each other in broad daylight… Then truly, we live in wack times indeed. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> ...I’ve been listening to a lot of teenagers, but I’m not sure I’ve ever heard them say that… ...Still, he’s trying so hard, it would be a shame to correct him.<br/>
<br/>
Would it really?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-MorganaAngry.png"/> OK, let’s get everyone together!<br/>
<br/>
Oh no, the game got mad at me for putting off the meetup again! <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Ryuji.png"/> Can we just get started? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> The forced investigation will take place on <b>November 20th</b>. That’s our deadline this time. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yusuke.png"/> Is there any possibility of that investigation being moved to an earlier date? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Goro.png"/> I highly doubt it. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Yusuke.png"/> How can you be so sure? Didn’t that want to catch us as soon as they possibly could? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Goro.png"/> They may be corrupt, but they are still a bureaucracy. <br/>
<br/>
That’s a really good explanation, honestly!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Goro.png"/> Certain steps must be taken in order to continue forward. Unless their situation becomes extremely dire, they won’t act with only circumstantial evidence. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-FutabaJacket.png"/> I’m impressed, detective man. You sure know a lot about internal affairs. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Haru.png"/> Yes, he is quite promising. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Goro.png"/> Well, this is purely a give-and-take relationship. You taught me the inner workings of the Phantom Thieves, so it’s only fair I return the favor. And I will be sure to contact everyone if the investigation team makes any odd movements. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> That would be helpful. <br/>

<br/>
So, now that we’ve got the gang together, we might as well… back out and cancel the operation! We have shit to do today! <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
First, we head to Jinbocho to pick up the reward.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Storeowner.jpg"/> I suppose I can sell you this book. I highly suggest you purchase it. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The reward is… another exorbitantly expensive book! Wow! For real though, this book is extremely helpful if you want that book-readin’ trophy because it doubles the number of “chapters” you can read per session. We buy it and resolve to never come back here.<br/>
<br/>
It's really weird, though, as yet another mechanic that comes into play so late in the game that it's just far too late to really take advantage of it. Bizarre.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-081.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We also decide to get all the books we haven’t bought from the Shibuya bookstore while we’re at it. At this point we have almost every book in the game. There’s only one we’re missing, but we haven’t done the prerequisite to unlock it yet. We’ll see about doing that sometime later. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Ryuji.png"/> ...Eh, I guess it ain’t gonna hurt gettin’ a change of pace. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Ryuji.png"/> It’s got to do with the track team… You mind hearin’ me out? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Ryuji.png"/> You’re a lifesaver, dude. I’m feelin’ real hungry, so let’s get some monja while we talk. It’s on me. <br/>

<br/>
Goddammit, Ryuji. You promised a free meal!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Ryuji.png"/> He said the track team’s gonna try n’ ditch Yamauchi. They wanna start practicin’ without him. They’re trying to get their old coach back too… The one from before Kamoshida. Looks like they’re finally walkin’ their own path. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Ryuji.png"/> It felt kinda bad, but that’s not where I belong now. When you first came to Shujin, people were talkin’ so much shit about you. But you took it in stride. You just did whatever you thought was cool, and didn’t care what other people said about you. <br/>
<br/>
Actually, I cried myself to sleep many times, but let’s pretend it’s your thing.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Ryuji.png"/> I think that’s why people kinda get pulled towards you, man. Wherever you decide to be, that’s where you belong. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-030.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Ryuji.png"/> Y’know… back before I met you, I kept makin’ excuses for why I couldn’t fit in. It was always ‘cause of someone else. Kamoshida, the track team… Hell, I even blamed my dad. I was such a freakin’ loser… <br/>
<br/>
I mean, those people weren’t exactly blameless in your status as an outcast.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Ryuji.png"/> But I’ve realized now… as long as I’m bein’ myself, I’ll always have somewhere I can fit in. It ain’t really the same place as before, but it’s damn good. ...I’m just glad I found it. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-032.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Ryuji.png"/> Right next to me… or maybe ahead? Something like that. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Ryuji.png"/> Wait, but if you can’t see me, am I really showin’ you anything…?<br/>
<br/>
Wanna see me self-actualize? ...Wanna see me do it again? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Ryuji.png"/> Eh, whatever. I think we’ve been talking too long. We’re all outta monja… Wanna try grillin’ some toothpicks? <br/>
<br/>
We’re definitely getting kicked out of this restaurant. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Ryuji.png"/> Let’s head home. <br/>

Isn’t speed reading kinda antithetical to the whole point of reading, which is to go slowly and be absorbed into a work? <br/>

We want to hang with Haru today, but she’s at school, and it’s a holiday. Thankfully, she’s visible from the gate. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The game’s pretty brutal here, putting a Rank 5 Proficiency gate before Haru’s Rank 2, meaning you can’t even get her Baton Pass until you’ve totally maxed it out. Thankfully, Proficiency is pretty easy to max, if repetitive. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-HaruGym.png"/> Most evidently, people have started trying to use my influence as majority shareholder to oust other employees. They say they come to me out of respect… but I know they really just want to use me. I’ve heard so many rumors… <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-HaruGym.png"/> There may be truth to that though. He’s been with the company for years, but has only started being nice to me recently. He even offered to assist me with asset management. I fear he has an ulterior motive though…<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-HaruGym.png"/> He even went as far as to recommend I sell my shares the other day. He said I could make a fortune… But I realized that if I did so, he would be able to strike the Okumura name completely.

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-Whisper.jpg"/> The Phantom Thieves are going way too far…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Chatter.jpg"/> Are they getting carried away by their popularity?<br/>
<br/>
<i>What</i> popularity?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-Whisper.jpg"/> Are the police going to do anything about this?<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-AnnChat.png"/> Ugh, that’s obviously not what we’re trying to do.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-GoroChat.jpg"/> This must be part of the plan to shift the blame onto the Phantom Thieves. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-GoroChat.jpg"/> Indeed. I have no intentions of letting this slide. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-FutabaChat.jpg"/> Man, this culprit guy really won’t let up. I don’t remember ever doing anything that’d make someone hate us THIS much.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-HaruChat.jpg"/> He used my father as well… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-GoroChat.jpg"/> I cannot fathom what his motive may be… We will just have to capture and interrogate him.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-MakotoChat.jpg"/> But before that, we need to change my sister’s heart. That’s our first step toward stopping him. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-GoroChat.jpg"/> I must agree. The true culprit will be caught, but before that we must deal with Sae-san. If ranking is being taken into consideration, perhaps I will be targeted too… Just kidding. <br/>
<br/>
Please don’t make jokes about this. You’re bad at it.<br/>

Double speed reading!<br/>

<br/>
Unfortunately, we can still only read one book at a time, and we still have more than a few unread one-session books. But our stats are maxed out already so unless you really care about that trophy unlocking the rest of the hangout spots is the only thing we have to gain. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> It’s a famous spiritual spot well-known for its walking paths. Quiet places like this seem nice. I bet you’d really be able to relax if you took someone there. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> Apparently, the <b>Meiji Shrine</b> has its own train station. That’s how popular that place is. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> Though I guess you could always go alone if you wanted to pray or make a wish for something. <br/>
<br/>
We’ll almost certainly never go here because it’s pretty redundant, but if we visit Meiji Shrine on our own during the afternoon, we can pray to increase our points with a Confidant, like with Chihaya. Unfortunately, it takes up time, but the tradeoff is that you can get more Confidant points per day.
