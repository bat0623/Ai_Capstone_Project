<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Sojiro.png"/> …… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-TV.jpg"/> We now resume our coverage of the Phantom Thieves, the suspects for Mr. Okumura’s death and others. The police have designated the Phantom Thieves as the country’s most wanted fugitives… And have decided to reward anyone with information leading to the capture of the Phantom Thieves. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>Thirty million!?</i> Hold on, I need to make a phone call.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-TV.jpg"/> And considering the high amount, it shows how extraordinary the situation has become. Reward money will be supplied by the police and the families of the victims, further--<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-005.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Sojiro.png"/> I hope you understand the situation you’re in. Even people who didn’t have an interest before will be on the lookout for the Phantom Thieves. And it’ll happen every day, even at school. ...Why did this happen? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Sojiro.png"/> This isn’t about me. Well, how do I put this…? I’m sorry I didn’t realize it. It’s also my responsibility that this happened. All I can do now is give you shelter. Just don’t become desperate and do something reckless, all right? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Sojiro.png"/> I won’t sell you out. As long as you’re here, there’s nothing to worry about. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MorganaSad.png"/> I feel bad about what we’ve done to the chief. I’m responsible too. <br/>

<br/>
Oh goddammit<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-SIU_Director.png"/> With this, the Phantom Thieves have become public enemy number one. ……. *chuckle* Exactly. ...That will be when their curtain falls. <br/>
<br/>
Why even have these scenes at this point? They’re all the same and we’re not learning anything new.<br/>

Oh hey, it’s Pallid Fella again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Boy_6.jpg"/> It’ll probably be the end of us if we start sniffing around now. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Boy_13.jpg"/> But… 30 million yen, man. Just let me dream a little. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-YusukeChat.jpg"/> I had braced myself for this possibility… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-AnnChat.png"/> Actually having a wanted notice out for us feels kinda weird…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-FutabaChat.jpg"/> I’m not sure we’re gonna get away this time. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-HaruChat.jpg"/> Our backs are truly against the wall now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Discussing it here won’t do us any good though. Let’s talk about it more in person. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Ryuji.png"/> And the reward’s thirty million yen? What is this, a comic book? Haha, it feels so unrealistic, I can’t help but laugh… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ann.png"/> We’re finally being treated as actual criminals… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Makoto.png"/> I’m positive now… Remember all of those what-ifs I mentioned before…? All of this was truly set up. How President Okumura ranked first, the fad before that, even Medjed… It was all to make the Phantom Thieves famous. On top of that, we were lured to target Okumura… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MorganaSad.png"/> Yeah… The enemy likely planned to lay the blame on us from the start, after we gained popularity. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ann.png"/> Then, what about everything we’ve done until now? Are the people whose hearts we changed and thought were corrupt actually not? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Makoto.png"/> No. Because of Yusuke and I, the Madarame and Kaneshiro cases were coincidental… Wasn’t that the case with Kamoshida too? Considering what happened with the rankings, only the previous target would have been used to lure us… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Ryuji.png"/> What a cheap trick to use…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Makoto.png"/> Cheap…? It’s nothing of the sort… There’s the fake Medjed and the site’s altercation. They might have even engineered the fad around us. So much time and effort has been put into this… President Okumura probably wasn’t their only target. Perhaps they intend to place all blame of past and future psychotic breakdowns on our group… <br/> 
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-014.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-015.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Ryuji.png"/> And there was that thing with Haru at the time. How’re we s’posed to ignore that, huh!? <br/>
<br/>
That’s actually a really solid point, game! We couldn’t very well ignore that and to be honest we had little solid reason to, but let’s keep throwing blame at each other for this shit, sure!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Haru.png"/> ...I’m sorry. This was all because I one-sidedly decided that my father was a criminal. All I could think about was my fiance. If I had only been able to cope with it more calmly… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Makoto.png"/> Haru… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ann.png"/> It’s not Haru’s fault. I should’ve spoken up too when Principal Kobayakawa died…! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-017.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ryuji takes his frustration out on the poor couch. <br/>
<br/>
He also catches himself mid-”fuck.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ann.png"/> Ryuji! Taking out your frustration on things doesn’t help anyone! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Ryuji.png"/> Hey, what do you think, Maaku? ...Why did we lose? What did we do wrong? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MorganaSad.png"/> It’s probably because… we weren’t acting like ourselves. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Yusuke.png"/> ...Agreed. At the time, we only cared about the opinion of the general public.<br/>
<br/>
...And saving Haru. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ann.png"/> Yeah… that really is it. I was… so caught up in making a name for ourselves. I’m such an idiot…! I became a Phantom Thief because I hated those same kinds of adults…! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh god, that’s certainly a sentence.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
What the hell are you talking about, Haru? This was your first one. You don’t get to talk like that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Makoto.png"/> I’m so irritated with myself…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-FutabaJacket.png"/> Makoto… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Ryuji.png"/> I know that we’ve been set up, and that I was a complete idiot too. But still… it’s so damn frustrating! Of course I wanna do something about this… <br/>
<br/>
Max Mittelman sells the hell out of this scene as Ryuji, for the record. I have some qualms with the way it’s written but it’s some top-notch voice work.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MorganaSad.png"/> Yeah. We’ll be in deep water at this rate… However, we have no idea who we’re up against… and whether they’re an individual or an organization. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Yusuke.png"/> Furthermore, they must be in a position of power, or have powerful backers, if they can go so far. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ann.png"/> Are we really a match for this…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-FutabaJacket.png"/> Should we… end this now? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-FutabaJacket.png"/> I mean, things might get worse for everyone… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ann.png"/> Hey, what should we do…? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-025.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-FutabaJacket.png"/> Absolutely not like this! <br/>

That’s nice. You gonna apologize to the couch you punched repeatedly?<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Ryuji.png"/> ...You too? It is confusin’. We’re wanted criminals now… Maybe I haven’t changed at all since that time we went up against Kamoshida… I wanted to be a phantom thief because I thought even someone like me could be a hero… It made me so happy to be depended on. Guess it all went straight to my head. I thought I could do anythin’ if it was for justice. But that’d make me no different from our targets… I called them shitbags, but I must be the shittiest of shitbags. I can’t even joke about it… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-HaruChat.jpg"/> Yeah. We’re going to overcome this, together.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Regardless, I don’t want anyone disturbing our pace anymore. Let’s go about this calmly. Well, see you all tomorrow. <br/>

That’s a wide fuckin’ net, and it’s still totally wrong!<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Shido.png"/> Only now does the government speak of taking countermeasures… but their actions are too little, too late! The government as it stands has been left behind the times. It is obsolete! If this is a ship that’s bound to a rotting dock and destined to sink, we might as well destroy is once. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Older_Employee.jpg"/> You haven’t voted until now? That’s problematic as a member of society, you know… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Office_Worker.jpg"/> Politics just never interested me before, but this politician seems pretty amazing. He’s passionate and thinks of the future. I mean, someone like that should be prime minister. I’m definitely voting for him. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Older_Employee.jpg"/> Well, I suppose that makes sense since the other politicians seem so unreliable… <br/>

It’s not too late to just kill this dude, you guys.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Makoto.png"/> Please keep this short. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> There’s a bounty for information in addition to the arrest warrant… Those are quite desperate measures. <br/>
<br/>
The group goes quiet.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> I’m referring to Sae-san’s actions. I assume all of you are at your wit’s end as well. She must be considerably vexed if she’s gone that far. Make headlines with the arrest warrant, then use incentives to get testimonies. It’s not a bad method. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-FutabaJacket.png"/> The police have nothing on us. There’s no way they can make an arrest. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> True. I’m the only one who’s ascertained your true identities. However, the groundwork for fabricating testimonies and concocting a culprit are underway.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-FutabaJacket.png"/> We don’t care about that self-gratification. Get on with it. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> I’ll be blunt.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Makoto says nothing.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Haru.png"/> Huh? Really…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Yusuke.png"/> Is this to prevent the investigation agency’s recklessness? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> Precisely. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ann.png"/> Still, there’s no need to change her heart just for that… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Yusuke.png"/> Indeed. It’s hard to believe that a single person can fabricate all that. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> Unfortunately, that’s not the case. What if I told you that those around her would turn a blind eye to false evidence? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The <i>police!? Do a bad!? Noooooooooo!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> It seems they’re more trusted than I thought. Their priority is settling the situation. They don’t care who the supposed culprit is. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Haru.png"/> No… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Ryuji.png"/> They’re completely rotten!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> My objective is to find the true culprit. That must be the case for all of you too. However, the current situation is extremely bad. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Yusuke.png"/> If worst comes to worst, someone unrelated will be set up as the culprit, huh…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> Our only solution to this is to make Sae-san come to her senses. If she’s in her right mind, she can stop this situation. Her sense of justice wouldn’t allow it. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Haru.png"/> So that’s why… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> The truth will be covered up, and an innocent civilian’s life will be destroyed… I can’t allow such a thing to happen. My own ethics won’t stand for it. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Ryuji.png"/> I mean, I guess I can understand how you feel. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> And changing Sae-san’s heart will be to protect her as well. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Makoto.png"/> How do you mean? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> If the true culprit were to learn that she’s responsible for the investigation… what would happen? I’m certain they’ll aim for her life. She’s the perfect target to place blame on the Phantom Thieves. <br/>
<br/>
Makoto stares at her lap.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> So how about it? Will you agree to my plan? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Yusuke.png"/> Even though you’re particular about being just, you’re willing to get your hands dirty? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> It can’t be helped in order to ascertain the truth. There is also one more merit in changing Sae-san’s heart. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> It will become a warning to not mess with us. They can’t go public if someone in the investigation has a change of heart. It’d show their corruption. All that’s left from there is for me to discover the identity of the true culprit. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ann.png"/> What do you mean…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Makoto.png"/> You’re gonna tell us to announce our disbandment once the real culprit is arrested… aren’t you? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> As expected from a Niijima. So, what do you say? I don’t think it’s a bad deal for either of us. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Ryuji.png"/> Makoto… what’s your take on all this? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Makoto.png"/> ...It’s a well-made plan. ...It even takes putting an end to our team into consideration. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> I’m flattered to hear that. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Haru.png"/> Why are you willing to do all this, Akechi-kun? Why do you seek justice? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> Yes. My contempt for such people drives my sense of justice. It isn’t some grand reason like society’s sake or some lofty ideal. It’s simply an absurd grudge… and extremely personal.<br/>
<br/>
How cryptic!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Ryuji.png"/> Dude… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ann.png"/> You know, doesn’t he remind you of us…? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ann.png"/> Yeah… like how some disgusting adult pissed him off. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> We’re similar, hm…? Maybe that’s why I thought that I could ask this of you all… Won’t you cooperate with me on the mission to change Sae-san’s heart? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> ...Thanks. I was actually rather worried there. This mission can’t succeed without your cooperation, after all. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Yusuke.png"/> The Phantom Thieves will be disbanded, and everything will work out… I pray it does. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Haru.png"/> Mako-chan… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Makoto.png"/> I’m OK. I never brought it up until now… but the reason I joined the Phantom Thieves is…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
How fortuitous… and fucked-up!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Makoto.png"/> I’ve also known for quite some time that she has a Palace. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Ann.png"/> Why didn’t you tell us? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Makoto.png"/> It was too selfish of a reason… Though, I was too scared to look any further into it on my own… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> Why don’t we try going there now to scope the place out? A lot of this will be new to me, so I’d like to get myself accustomed to it too. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-058.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> I see. That’s unfortunate. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Haru.png"/> Will you tell your sister about this? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Makoto.png"/> Of course not. It’s just… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Yusuke.png"/> You seem awfully evasive today. Is something the matter? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Makoto.png"/> I just can’t make time today. <br/>
<br/>
How suspicious!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Goro.png"/> Let’s call it a day then and resume this tomorrow. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Makoto.png"/> I’m sorry, everyone. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-060.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MorganaSad.png"/> Well, I guess that can’t be helped… Regardless, it all starts tomorrow. ...I hope this goes well. <br/>

<br/>
The numbers are slowing down...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Sae.png"/> Not only that, Goro Akechi…? Then the Phantom Thieves targeted me as per his advice…? And he had already experienced the Metaverse by the time of the Okumura case? That can’t be… I mean, he never said a word… Although, his attitude did change suddenly around that time. Akechi-kun kept quiet about the most important details, and my own sister may be a Phantom Thief… If this is all true, I’m appalled as the commander of this operation. I alone was kept in the dark… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Sae.png"/> And if you were apprehended while falsely accused of those crimes, that villain would still be loose. That’s why you targeted me…? Not for your own preservation?<br/>
<br/>
Well, it was kinda <i>both,</i> you see...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Sae.png"/> Believe you? I’m just considering it as a possibility. Then again, if you wanted to evade capture, triggering my change of heart wouldn’t guarantee anything. Your actions as Phantom Thieves would still be met with hostility. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Sae.png"/> If this villain does exist and is setting up your group… ...I would be targeted next. ...Did Makoto come up with that speculation?<br/>
<br/>
Nope!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Sae.png"/> Perhaps I’m overthinking things… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Maaku’s vision gets hazy once more...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-068.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Sae.png"/> You need to keep your focus! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Sae.png"/> But the look on your face isn’t one of defeat… Why is that…? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Sae.png"/> ...I’m amazed. It seems you can still talk. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-072.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah. To be honest, that was like eighty hours of game and fourteen real-life months ago, so I kinda forgot.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Sae.png"/> Those words normally hint at the existence of a traitor… However, if your story till now is true… one reason can be concluded. It’s frustrating to admit, but at a certain point—no, most likely from the start—I was a mere puppet… ...Someone set up only to bear responsibility later. Someone “intended” your arrest, and the minimal staff directly involved were in their pocket. And if that’s the case, true integrity would side with you… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-ProtagInterro.png"/> <i>Sae is slowly starting to accept the truth… I feel like my bond with Sae is growing deeper…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Sae.png"/> No, I’m jumping to conclusions. I don’t believe your story yet. There’s something I need to confirm with you… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Sae.png"/> What happened in the time between entering my Palace and your arrest? Tell me everything.
