Congratulations to Haru for winning the romance contest through bribery! We’ll get right on that when the game actually lets us!<br/>

<br/>
Something in me just loves the idea that these shitheads just immediately go “problem’s fixed, time for a burger!”<br/>
<br/>
<b>Anon: calling card! FIRST!!!!!</b><br/>
<br/>
Also, this idiot.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Anon: its getting exciting!<br/>
Anon: Took you long enough!<br/>
Anon: Our savior’s made a move! <br/>
Anon: i don’t care, just do it</b><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> The Palace is gone, so I guess we’re waiting for a while. What do you guys do at times like these? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> I see… I suppose it’ll do us good to take it easy every now and then. Still, don’t go overboard. You can’t forget your primary duties as a high schooler. It’s important to play the part of a diligent student, right? <br/>
<br/>
Whatever, lame-o. I’m giving up on you. The people have demanded Haru, and by god, they’ll get her!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> That’s not an excuse to slack off! We should still use our time wisely! <br/>
<br/>
Or, they would if it was possible right now. Haru’s got an annoying Confidant that can’t be initiated until rather late, and by “rather late” I of course mean “after this block of the game finishes.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-005.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Also, <i>every single person</i> available to hang out during the day wants to spend time with us right now. It’s nuts!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Girl_6.jpg"/> Y-Yeah… I knew, but… Don’t say stuff like that so loud… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Girl_5.jpg"/> It’s so shocking though. I mean, it’s all connected to our school again. Now that President Okumura got that calling card, what do you think will happen? <br/>
<br/>
But first, we’re doing another round of people-watching. Err, listening, rather. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
‘Sup girl. How you livin’?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Newspaper.jpg"/> I’m sure the Phantom Thieves are watching the news too, but I wonder what they’re thinking. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Newspaper.jpg"/> They’ve been acting as symbols of hope, after al. I even hear people refer to them as saviors. If everything on that calling card is true, this might just be a turning point in history. Maybe I’m getting ahead of myself, but there’s no doubt of the attention this is getting. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Newspaper.jpg"/> I don’t blame them. Some people expect a bit much for the requests they send to the Phantom Thieves. If everything on that calling card is true, this might just be a turning point in history. Maybe I’m getting ahead of myself, but there’s no doubt of the attention this is getting. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Newspaper.jpg"/> I hope that’s the case. I’m a bit worried because some people can react irresponsibly to all this. If everything on that calling card is true, this might just be a turning point in history. Maybe I’m getting ahead of myself, but there’s no doubt of the attention this is getting. <br/>
<br/>
I like Newspaper Club Member. She’s really mellowed out towards us and she supports the Phantom Thieves respectfully.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Girl_4.jpg"/> Her dad was on TV saying they called the police about it. Speaking of, you wouldn’t believe how huge their house is… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Girl_5.jpg"/> I dunno though. I mean, if he made all his money doing bad stuff, he deserves to be punished. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Boy_12.jpg"/> Hey, not so loud! Okumura-san’s probably going through a rough time right now… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Boy_10.jpg"/> Still, a man who exploited his employees is irredeemable. Perhaps the Phantom Thieves should finish him off. The world doesn’t need more people like him.<br/>
<br/>
Holy shit! These people are bloodthirsty!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Boy_1.jpg"/> You know, I overheard that the president of that corporation is Okumura-senpai’s father. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Boy_5.jpg"/> Whaat? I didn’t know you were into girls like that. Huh. This whole time, you were a gold digger… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Boy_1.jpg"/> Stop messing around! We need to devote as much time as we can to our teams. We can’t let ourselves be distracted by women!<br/>
<br/>
Poor Haru, getting gossiped about constantly. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Boy_8.jpg"/> The food there is cheap, but it’s filling. It might suck if Big Bang weren’t around anymore. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Boy_3.jpg"/> Nah, bad guys should be punished. And those press conferences where they apologize are fun to watch. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Teacher_1.jpg"/> Hmm, it’s tough to say. I mean, I’m not really the hero type. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Gaudy_Female_Student.jpg"/> Ahaha! Maybe you’re right! Being a Phantom Thief must be hard. Just listening to everyone’s requests must take a lot of work. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Boy_4.jpg"/> I’ve heard his daughter goes to this school, but I can’t stay my hand. Evil must be defeated.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Boy_4.jpg"/> Heh, it must be nice to be so carefree. I wish I could live out a normal, quiet civilian life too. <br/>
<br/>
I’m actually starting to get a little annoyed with this dipshit. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Reporter.jpg"/> What do you think about the Phantom Thieves sending President Okumura a calling card? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Reporter.jpg"/> So then, punishment is a matter of fact for companies that exploit their enemies. And you’re saying that this issue won’t be resolved until the president begs for forgiveness. And that concludes our on-the-spot coverage. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-BDL.jpg"/> …...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Protestor.jpg"/> What’s wrong, Sun God? You look sullen… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-BDL.jpg"/> The people only believe in the Phantom Thieves… What good is my power…? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-022.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Homeless_Man.jpg"/> Haha, I appreciate you trying to help. It’s like you really are some kind of phantom thief hero. However… I don’t even know who I’m even trying to target… Sorry, I’m just talking to myself. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Boy_14.jpg"/> You just now found that out? It’s all over the internet. He’s getting bashed left and right. Corrupt companies are the worst! The Phantom Thieves will do something about it! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Woman_9.jpg"/> Well, the Phantom Thieves sent out their calling card. Can’t be good news for the corporate bigwigs. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Woman_8.jpg"/> The police need to get off their fat asses and arrest those delinquents! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Woman_9.jpg"/> I thought you were a fan of the Phantom Thieves? Ohoho, I know times are tough right now, but… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Man_7.jpg"/> But with the flak they’re getting, it’s tough bringing girls there. Where’re you taking your ladies? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Man_5.jpg"/> All sorts of different places, naturally! There’s tons of places where you can take women… <br/>
<br/>
I’m probably an idiot for just now realizing this, but I’m pretty sure now that Veteran Pick-up Artist is a total fucking fraud.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Man_7.jpg"/> I met a really nice girl, lately. I hope I can take her someplace fancy one day. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Mother.jpg"/> Not really. There are other places that sell them.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Dog-loving_Girl.jpg"/> We can go with Kotaro again! Let’s go and cheer on the Phantom Thieves!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Mother.jpg"/> Yeah… I hope he feels better soon. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Boom_Box.jpg"/> I used to go to Big Bang Burger a lot myself. They’re a big company with a good image, so I feel like I’ve been betrayed. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Old_Man_3.jpg"/> That’s just the way the world is. Not worth making a big deal over it at this point. <br/>

Oh hey, Fishy Hawker’s still on the streets! I was worried about you, ya giant scumbag. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Man_9.jpg"/> B-But the price of the Okumura Foods stock I bought from my friend has plummeted… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Fishy_Hawker.jpg"/> All you have to do is make up for it! Actually, I’ve got this secret information…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Man_9.jpg"/> R-Really!? Please, tell me what it is! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Promoter.jpg"/> Danger could strike your company at any time. And just like that, your life as you know it crumbles. You never know what might happen, but at least you can give your home the very best protection. Wanna-B-Alert can help you! For a limited time, sign up with a zero-down contract!<br/>
<br/>
What a horrifying scenario you have presented that your product doesn’t solve in the slightest!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Lawyer.jpg"/> Thanks to them, I’m getting tons of labor-related inquiries. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Winger.jpg"/> Unpaid and illegal overtime, abuse of position… I can’t believe they dealt with it for so long. People are standing up for their rights after the Okumura thing. I’ll be busy for quite a while. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-036.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-037.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
And now, to Akihabara. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-039.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Office_Worker.jpg"/> Don’t worry, we’ll keep visiting you at “Alice’s Apron”! It’s the promised land for guys like us! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Maid.jpg"/> Ew, gross. Who are you again, creep? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Office_Worker.jpg"/> Waah! Harsh on the outside… and harsh on the inside. But why’s my heart beating so fast? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Man_3.jpg"/> Well, it’s over for them if they piss off their sponsors. No network’s gonna bash Okumura Foods. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Nerd.jpg"/> I wish the Phantom Thieves would take care of this already. Okumura’s 100% guilty. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Man_3.jpg"/> Yep, our Phantom Thieves will take care of him! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-042.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Busy_Young_Man.jpg"/> I still have some capital left over. Yeah, the Phantom Thieves are where it’s at… I’ve got it. I’ll buy a crap ton of stocks for places making money off the Phantom Thieves!<br/>
<br/>
Can’t see an issue with this plan!<br/>
<br/>
Also, it’s hard to see due to the nameplate, but he’s crumpled into a ball on the ground. It owns.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Now that we’re done with eavesdropping for today, let’s go fill that Strength request we put aside a few updates back. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Justine.png"/> I see you have brought us the <b>Hecatoncheires</b> with <b>Masukunda</b>… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Caroline.png"/> You managed to do all three assignments, and you didn’t once try to give up! Not bad! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Caroline.png"/> We might be getting close to finding out the hidden goal behind that list. *snicker* Y’know thanks to you, I’m actually starting to look forward to seeing what happens. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Justine.png"/> Your attitude has shifted quite considerably, Caroline. I see now that the harsh mask you wear during the fusion ritual is nothing more than a facade. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Justine.png"/> Perhaps in your heart, you have longed for the days the inmate would come to fuse the specified Personas. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Caroline.png"/> And what about you, Justine!? You’ve been real talkative lately! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Justine.png"/> *chuckle* I suppose you are correct. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Caroline.png"/> I-I’ve never heard you laugh before, Justine… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Justine.png"/> We have both clearly changed quite a bit recently. Perhaps my hypothesis is true after all. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Justine.png"/> We have thought that if we were to complete the list, we would bring to light the intent of its creator… We have overseen the inmate, all the while considering the changes that have begun to appear within him… However… can it truly be said that the inmate is the only one who has changed? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Justine.png"/> The completion of these tasks has also had a great impact on both my consciousness and my memories. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Justine.png"/> I have no proof of that. However… if this list represented the will of our master, why has it fallen into our hands and not his? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Caroline.png"/> This has gotta be some kinda joke… You’re telling me somebody made it… so they could change us…? But… why? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Caroline.png"/> …...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Caroline.png"/> W-Wait, I recognize this voice…! Urgh…! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Justine.png"/> Caroline!? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-Igor.png"/> Does something trouble you? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Justine.png"/> O-Our apologies, Master. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-Igor.png"/> Is the inmate proving to be too horrible a subject for you?<br/>
<br/>
Aww man, I thought Igor liked us. We’re Rank 8, man! We’re bros!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Caroline.png"/> No, the fault does not lie with him. If you must reprimand anyone… then let it be us.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Justine.png"/> Caroline… <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Caroline seems to have thoroughly defrosted. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-Igor.png"/> ...I see. Very well, continue onward with his rehabilitation. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Justine.png"/> Now then, as you have completed three tasks, let us bestow upon you the next reward. We shall grant you permission to use the special Isolation cell. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Caroline.png"/> You use it just like a normal Lockdown cell… but it’s a heck of a lot stronger! *snicker* How’s it stronger exactly? ‘Cause the Persona you pop in there will learn a stronger resistance skill! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Justine.png"/> We expect that you will put its services to good use.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-ProtagNoGlasses.png"/> *nods*<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This is exactly how it was described in the tooltip and by Caroline. We can get stronger resistance skills from it. Hopefully now we can get something better than <i>fucking Resist Dizzy.</i> It’s still random and we’re still probably never gonna use this, but whatever. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Caroline.png"/> Hmph. So I guess we’ve changed, huh… That much is clear. Strength… The eleventh arcana, which near-evenly splits the major twenty-two… The awakening of the unknown… A solitary woman calmly coming to face a lion… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Justine.png"/> Caroline. Let us assign the inmate his next task before we discuss this matter any further. If this list is meant to change us, that change must surely be important… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Caroline.png"/> ...Fine. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Caroline.png"/> Oh, and your next reward is gonna be incredible, so you’ve gotta do two tasks before you can have it!<br/>
<br/>
She’s not lying, at least in comparison to the other rewards.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Justine.png"/> Accordingly, these next two shall be the most difficult you have faced to this point. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Justine.png"/> Try to harbor a <b>Bugs</b> with <b>Samarecarm</b> within you. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Caroline.png"/> We’ll be waiting for you. Though I know you won’t give up just ‘cause it’s hard! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-ProtagNoGlasses.png"/> *nods*<br/>

Makoto’s Confidant is awful low for how much we use her. Let’s get to fixing that, especially now that we have enough Charm. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> Oh, so I spoke with Eiko and she said her boyfriend was OK with the double date idea. She asked me to show her your picture though… Apparently, um… she thinks you look a little lame… She told me that my boyfriend isn’t in the same league as her Tsukasa… But I think she’ll change her mind once she sees you in person. Don’t worry, I’ll back you up. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> Thank goodness. I’ll contact Eiko. Let’s meet at the diner, as I mentioned before. <br/>
<br/>
Fine. But it’s strictly platonic. My heart is currently reserved for a burger heiress who is almost distressingly soft-spoken.<br/>

<br/>
Wait, <i>this</i> is her boyfriend!? I know Makoto said he was a host but this guy looks about thirty-eight! What’s wrong with his <i>hair!?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Tsukasa.jpg"/> So I heard you’re the student council prez, Makoto-chan? I totally wish I could be one of your council members.<br/>
<br/>
I want to be far away from this dude right fucking now, and I want the same for Makoto. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> Y-Yes, I am… Totally… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Tsukasa.jpg"/> And Glasses-kun over here is your boyfriend, yeah? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> Y-Yeah… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Tsukasa.jpg"/> Huh. Looks like you guys don’t get along too good though. It’s like your love level’s rock bottom. Are you seriously datin’?<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Tsukasa.jpg"/> Hey babe, did you do something special today? I don’t remember you lookin’ this sexy.<br/>
<br/>
It’s like Steve Buscemi in that 30 Rock “How do you do, fellow kids” gif except he’s also horny and also I can’t actually see the gif at all because I’m too busy vomiting. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-Eiko.jpg"/> Oh, Tsukasaaa! ♥<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> …...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-Eiko.jpg"/> Sorry, I hafta use the bathroom. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> Um, there’s something I’d like to ask you… Are you serious about pursuing a relationship with Eiko? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Tsukasa.jpg"/> Aha! I was wonderin’ when our honor student was gonna show her true colors! That reminds me, Eiko said you were real pumped about gettin’ to know me. Why’s that, huh? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> ...I just wanted to make sure you’re good for her. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Tsukasa.jpg"/> Daaaaaamn girl, you really care about your friends! Good stuff. I always say, friends’re like, super important n’ shit. Speakin’ of which, a friend of my GF is totally a friend of mine. How ‘bout you tell me your digits? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> Huh? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Tsukasa.jpg"/> What’s wrong? C’mon, gimme your number. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> I-I, um… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Tsukasa.jpg"/> Nobody asked you, Glasses-kun. Anyways, Eiko already gave me yours, Mako-chan. We good. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Okay, first, you’re appropriating Haru’s nickname for Makoto and I’m gonna need you to stop doing that. Second, holy shit this dude is actually kinda scary. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> I do have one more question to ask… You’re not going to bring Eiko to your club, are you? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Tsukasa.jpg"/> What, you suspectin’ me? I wouldn’t dream of it. It’s a damn shame people think us hosts’re just flirts.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, it’s kinda your job.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Tsukasa.jpg"/> But my love with Eiko is pure as snow. Don’t twist the story. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="111-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Tsukasa.jpg"/> Oh, I was just gettin’ to know your little friend here, honey. Welp, I should get goin’. I’ve gotta be at work soon. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-Eiko.jpg"/> Ah, me too! <i>(to Makoto)</i> Byeee!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> But no matter what I might think, I still don’t have any proof… and above all, Eiko seems really happy. Am I just… getting in the way of their happiness? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="113-070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That dude’s a certified creep, don’t worry about it. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> I suppose so… I mean, I really am worried about Eiko here… In the end, I know this is just a hunch… but my father always stressed how important it is to trust hunches. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="114-072.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ah, gross!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> ...What is this supposed to be saying? It’s full of emojis. “It’s meee, Tsukasa. *heart emoji* I no we just met but I cudn’t wait 2 *phone emoji* u. I’m so haP to b friends with u, MakoC. *clapping emoji* *clapping emoji* *hot springs emoji*”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> That was barely a coherent sentence, but I’ll need to get used to that if I’m going to help Eiko… By the way, I’m glad you were here with me. I would have really panicked had I been alone… I honestly despise how immature I can be sometimes… But I’m working through that with your help, so… thank you. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="117-Protag.png"/> <i>I can sense Makoto’s trust in me...</i> <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="118-075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I’m actually kind of glad we didn’t have this for the last fight because it would’ve complicated things due to the Hunger mechanic. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummer.png"/> We should get going too. I’ll let you know if anything else comes up. Goodbye. <br/>

The guy that’s got a hold on me, his heart’s startin’ to weaken. ...Who am I talkin’ about? Someone real close to me! Haha!<br/>
<br/>
Oh no, the weird Jekyll/Hyde situation with our good buddy Homeless Man is getting worse by the day...<br/>

For instance… You hear that hoity-toity bastard got a calling card? He finally got the Phantom Thieves’ attention. They’re punishing evil people that the law can’t reach. Those phantom thieves are just like me, hahaha!<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="146-Office_Worker_3.jpg"/> No. You know how Okumura Food’s stock price fell after their president got that calling card? She’s worried that if a big company like that can fail, ours might fail too. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="156-Office_Worker_2.jpg"/> She’s more worried about the company than you? Well, it’s kind of the same with my wife… <br/>
<br/>
That’s kind of an interesting conversation to me. We haven’t really thought about the potential damage just <i>receiving</i> a calling card would do to a public company at this point, and it’s nice to see that reflected in some of these conversations. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="163-HifumiSummer.png"/> I… I had no idea. I feel so ashamed… However, thinking back, I do recall some of my opponents making poor moves at odd times… …… I’ve always wanted people to recognize my shogi skills… but I suppose I never had any.

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="163-HifumiSummer.png"/> It was painful to hear the truth, but I’m glad that my mother had a change of heart. I’ve decided… ...I’m not going to lose. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="163-HifumiSummer.png"/> I know I’ll receive a lot of criticism… but I must ensure the truth is known. This next match will showcase my true talents. I don’t know how it’s going to go… but I hope you’ll watch. As your teacher, I promise to put up a good fight so I don’t embarrass myself. <br/>

However, I intend to fight with dignity to the very end, as a queen should. There’s a new move I’d like to test out for the exhibition… Will you stay for another game?

Hifumi’s a pretty good character, honestly.
