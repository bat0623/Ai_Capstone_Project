	<b>Addendum V: Double Trouble</b><br/><br/>

<br/>
Today, we’re heading back into Mementos. Not to tackle requests, but to see pretty much the only major addition to P5 in New Game+.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
If we head to Mementos of our own volition (so not the first time or on Christmas Eve), we will see something… unusual.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Why, Caroline is outside of the Velvet Room! That’s new!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Caroline.png"/> Or… Is there something you want to tell the two of us? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-006.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-007.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Justine.png"/> I never expected your rehabilitation would bring you to this place. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Caroline.png"/> No matter! It’s the perfect spot to train and get some battle experience! I like your spirit. You know the position you’re in. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Justine.png"/> Although, how did he learn of Mementos…? Perhaps he is even more special than we had anticipated. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Caroline.png"/> Hmph. I bet he just fumbled around with the Meta-Nav until he ended up here. I mean, who’d even be able to tell him about this place? We know everyone who might have access. Mementos is linked to the collective unconscious, after all.<br/>
<br/>
The cat showed me how. You know, the cat? He’s right over there. I can go get him if you want. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Justine.png"/> That is true… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Caroline.png"/> Hmph. I will admit… even though he looks pretty shabby, he seems to have a few tricks up his sleeve. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Justine.png"/> If he has been keeping his power a secret from us… we must learn the truth behind it. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Caroline.png"/> Oh, I see! *snicker* We’ll hold a special “private examination” to find out if he’s hiding anything. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it’s just my experience with Takemi, but I don’t like the sound of that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Justine.png"/> Unlike in the city, we will not have to worry about passersby here. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Caroline.png"/> I have to say Justine, I never thought you’d bring such a bold proposal to the table!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-010.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Justine.png"/> As she said, this will be a private examination. It is all for the sake of our own personal judgment. Hence, we will not force it upon you. We will begin only once we have received your consent. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Caroline.png"/> It’s gonna be brutally hard, after all! Max difficulty! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Justine.png"/> Your rehabilitation consists of a great variety of tasks. Battling Shadows, strengthening your Personas, building bonds with your contractors… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Caroline.png"/> Basically, we’re gonna put all that to the test! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-012.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Uhhh, what? I’m not so sure about beating up these fourth graders. Seems kinda gauche.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Justine.png"/> We will not ask for a two-on-one battle, though. Your friends are permitted to participate as well.<br/>
<br/>
But that’s just two-on-one in the other direction.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Justine.png"/> The contracts you have formed with them can be considered part of your power, after all. However, this test is ultimately for you. Your teammates will not retain any memory of this battle.<br/>
<br/>
That’s good. At least they won’t remember that time I asked them to murder some children.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Caroline.png"/> *chuckle* Don’t worry… We won’t kill you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Justine.png"/> Our goal is rehabilitation. Ending your life would greatly contradict that goal. Should you fall, you will regain consciousness immediately. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Caroline.png"/> Once you pass out though, that’s it. The battle’s over. ...Oh, and there’s not even a one-in-a-billion chance you’ll win, so you should just forget it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Justine.png"/> If by some chance that were to happen… let me see… We would tell you an embarrassing secret of ours. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Caroline.png"/> ...A-Are you talking about that one time? Or… maybe that other thing!? W-Wait! There’s no need for this! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Justine.png"/> We might be able to find the answer. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Justine.png"/> Strange, don’t you think? Why do we possess such an intricate bookmark when neither of us have any books to read? Moreover, I somehow know that this is “important”… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Caroline.png"/> Justine…? Don’t tell me… Are you actually trying to find…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Justine.png"/> ...My apologies. I have said too much.<br/>
<br/>
Oh boy, I love cryptic bullshit like this!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Justine.png"/> Let us begin, Caroline. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Caroline.png"/> R-Right!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Caroline.png"/> It shows how special we think you are. Consider this an honor! You should be crying tears of joy! OK… Let’s get started! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-019.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Justine.png"/> We will cordon off a portion of this area for the examination. That will limit potential interference. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Caroline.png"/> Don’t worry, we’ll make it look really familiar for you. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Justine.png"/> Now then… do not disappoint us! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Twins.gif"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Fine, if we’re doing this, then I’m at least gonna enjoy it! You kicked me into the Velvet Room <i>every time</i> for a <i>year!</i> Let’s go!<br/>

<br/>
Yep, they know it’s the best song in the game and there’s nothing else they could possibly use here.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the warning Morgana, but how bad could it possibly be?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I’ll try to explain the mechanics for this fight as I go.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Hmm, not even a dent. That’s distressing.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-033.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-034.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Our next hint that we shouldn’t even be attempting this yet is that our party members keep missing due to their low Agility. Not that they’re doing any real damage when they hit anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-036.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Justine here summons Slime to use Vajra Blast, that old skill of Makoto’s that dealt partywide Medium Physical damage. The “gimmick” for modern Persona bonus bosses (so Elizabeth from 3, Margaret from 4, and these two) is that they have the ability to switch between various Personas just like you because they have access to the Compendium. They don’t have the affiliated elemental resistances and weaknesses because they’re dirty fucking cheaters, but they can also only use one skill per Persona (even if that Persona doesn’t actually have or learn that skill, such as in this case), and they’ll switch between them in a set order. This means that you can generally predict their next set of actions. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-038.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-039.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And yes, they of course get two turns. Justine here summons Bugs to use Triple Down, that Gun skill Haru had that dealt Light damage thrice to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Uhhhhhhhhhh<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-042.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-043.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Mom, those mean girls at the elementary school took my lunch money<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Geez, rub it in why don’t you?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-046.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-047.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Justine.png"/> We cannot carry out our examination in this state. Do try to put up more of a fight next time. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Caroline.png"/> If you even have the guts to try again, that is. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And then it spits us out in the lobby with 1 HP. We suck! I’ll go back and fight them again every chance I get, but it’s going to be a while before we make any headway there, I suspect. I’ll see you then.
