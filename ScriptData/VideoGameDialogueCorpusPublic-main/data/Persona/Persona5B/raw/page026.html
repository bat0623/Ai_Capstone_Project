<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chatter.jpg"/> Guh… Pollen allergies suck… I couldn’t go to the mountains even if I wanted to… My eyes and nose would gush like rivers.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Whisper.jpg"/> That sounds awful...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> That’s right, the news said pollen season was starting later than usual this year. Looks like the pollen problems have only just begun. People are about to have some itchy eyes. This might affect Mementos the same way weather does.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Ann.png"/> ...Allergies? Oh, uh, maybe! I do feel kind of dazed, and everything feels weird! But… um… actually… I’ve been having this feeling that someone’s watching me… I hope not… Oh! Maybe I just can’t shake off the feeling of infiltrating a Palace! At the Palace, we’re always cautious of not being noticed, you know! So it has to be my imagination… Yeah...<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chatter.jpg"/> He got what he deserved…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chatter.jpg"/> I wonder who put up those postings.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chatter.jpg"/> What’s his problem? Casting shame on the whole school like that...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chatter.jpg"/>Your life is pretty much over if you do something like that.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-AnnChat.png"/> That might be true, but I don’t have any sympathy for him. He got what he deserved.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-RyujiChat.png"/> For sure.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-010.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-MishimaChat.png"/> I saw it on the Phan-Site, but I’ve heard about it at school too. Anyway, there’s a guy at school whose bullying has gone too far. I want to help the victim, but that’s impossible for me...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-MishimaChat.png"/> You’re amazing! The bully is a brown-haired guy frequently seen standing out front of the school entrance. And from what I can tell, his name is Daisuke Takanashi. Just make sure nobody knows I told you the name!<br/>
<br/>
Maaku immediately goes up to the blackboard and writes “MISHIMA’S A NARC.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> What good timing! I know this is a small case, but we have a name, so we should be able to consider him a target. Let’s go gather at the hideout and discuss!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And we’re immediately whisked away to the hideout (that hasn’t been closed off yet, oddly) to talk about Mementos.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Music:</b> <a href="https://clyp.it/xgygzltf?token=453ba8f05314d2b84945c0acae73d4f5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Suspicion</a><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Ann.png"/> What are you talking about? Don’t we need to study for exams?<br/>
<br/>
Pff, nerd.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ryuji.png"/> Eh, don’t worry ‘bout that stuff. Let’s ignore the details and just go chargin’ in head-first!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Ann.png"/> That’s easy for you to say… but we don’t even have a target.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> That’s actually not a problem anymore. Some intel has come in from Mishima.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ryuji.png"/> Ooh, perfect timin’! Let’s just go in right now then!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Ann.png"/> You’ll really do anything to avoid studying, huh…?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-015.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-016.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-018.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
So, we have two options here. Despite the game spitting us out at the hideout, we can actually duck out of here and go raise Confidants, or we can do what the game wants and head into Mementos. For today, we’ll be exploring… both options. First, we’ll very briefly head into Mementos to explore the weather effect, then reload and raise a Confidant instead. This isn’t because I’m afraid to deviate from a schedule, but more because there’s something I want to do ASAP and I can’t afford to lose my night time as well if I want to get to it. We’ll see that in the next update, though.<br/>
<br/>
Before we head into Mementos, though, we need to confirm the target by hitting “View Requests.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ryuji.png"/> C’mon, just tell us…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Ann.png"/> Oh… do you mean the calling card!? But wait a sec… did we send one the last time?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> The Treasure materializes when we change the target’s subconscious with a calling card. That’s the rule when dealing with a Palace. But in Mementos, it seems like we can just go for the target immediately.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ryuji.png"/> Wait, what? We don’t need a calling card or nothing?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> Something else already exists that fulfills that role. Fortunately for us, Mishima put a comment up in the forum saying the Phantom Thieves are coming. For a small target, that’s enough of a calling card. That alone will put some fear in them for a while. Even that Nakanohara must have seen Mishima’s comments about him on the Phan-Site. And that’s why the Nav picked up on him.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Ann.png"/> ...Can we really leave something that important to someone else!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> The desires of the Mementos Shadows are nothing compared to those of the Palace rulers. Still, we need to unanimously agree on our target. No ignoring the rules, even for smaller ones. Anyway, let’s get to discussing the intel we’ve gathered! This intel is on an <b>arrogant brown-haired bully</b>. He’s a student at Shujin Academy. Things have gone a little too far for just bullying though. He’s abusing and blackmailing kids.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ryuji.png"/> He’s the perfect target! C’mon, let’s take him down!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Ann.png"/> Are you sure you aren’t just excited to go to Mementos? Then again, we can’t really leave a guy like that be… We should go.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> No objections, right? Mm… we’re good to go if you’re OK with it. That’s a unanimous decision! OK, all that’s left now is to take down the target in Mementos!<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We can warp around to certain floors of Mementos, which is a life-saver.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> Oh yeah… I have something for you before we head in there.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> Those were the last I had. You’re on your own now, OK?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-AnnPanther.png"/> The target’s really in here, huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> Definitely. I’m sensing them deeper than before, but their presence is certainly here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-RyujiSkull.png"/> All right then. Let’s go look for ‘em!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> Achoo! Achoo! The pollen’s out of control today… It’ll definitely have an impact on Mementos...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-RyujiSkull.png"/> Huh? Whaddya mean?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> Well, Mementos is affected by the emotions of the public.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-AnnPanther.png"/> Wait, so you’re saying… weather changes people’s feelings, and that in turn changes Mementos?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> Not just Mementos. The Shadows inside too. The type of change will depend on what kind of weather it is. This might turn out to be useful.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-028.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-029.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
More dangerous Shadows, but more items as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-RyujiSkull.png"/> What happens when there’s a ton of pollen?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> I’m not too sure… but the impact on Mementos is determined by how the public is feeling. How have other people been seeming to you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-AnnPanther.png"/> Come to think of it, some of the kids in my class have bad allergies. They all seem really out of it. Apparently the medicine makes them sleepy...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> I see… There might be a similar effect in Mementos then...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Sleepy shadows means free ambushes and avoidable fights, which is a really great effect.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-RyujiSkull.png"/> So it’ll prolly be easier to beat Shadows or ignore ‘em completely. C’mon, let’s go find out.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Sure enough, this Shadow is asleep. But we’ll leave actually dungeon crawling for a later date. Reload!<br/>

Out in front of the school, we find that bully, Daisuke. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Boy_7.jpg"/> I don’t know wh-what you want from me...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Boy_5.jpg"/> Only good thing you got going on is that you’re loaded. Understand me, you two-legged volleyball?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Boy_6.jpg"/> Harsh, Daisuke! Oh man, Hippo looks like he’s about to cry!<br/>
<br/>
Yikes.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Boy_9.jpg"/> She looked tired, especially because of the Kamoshida incident. I heard she’s been acting under direct orders by the principal. I wonder what she’s doing.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Girl_7.jpg"/> I don’t know. She hasn’t said anything to me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Boy_9.jpg"/> I guess she can’t rely on us for some reason. I wish she wouldn’t handle everything alone like that.<br/>
<br/>
Seems like Makoto’s got her hands full. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Let’s go check on her.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Makoto.png"/> Was he acting any different after that strange posting went up?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Boy_1.jpg"/> Ummm… I think he was the same as always, but I’m not sure… I heard he’s dangerous, so I try to keep my distance from him...<br/>
<br/>
Whoever could they be talking about? Dangerous? Better steer clear of that guy.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Boy_1.jpg"/> I’m sorry, I don’t know anything else… Is he involved in this?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Newspaper.jpg"/> ...All I’ve done till now is avoid you though, so I’ll hear you out if you wanted to ask me anything.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Newspaper.jpg"/> I haven’t found much on them at all. I haven’t seen much info on the internet, either…<br/>
<br/>
They have a fucking <i>website.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Let’s hang out with Ryuji today.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ryuji.png"/> So, y’know how we were lookin’ for somewhere we can train? Well, I finally found a spot. We’re free to do whatever we want! How ‘bout we head on over there?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Protag.png"/> &gt;Hang out with him<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ryuji.png"/> It’s a gym over in Shibuya. Pretty damn cheap too.<br/>

<br/>

The equipment’s kinda crappy, but they got tons of variety. Plus, it’s real damn cheap. Totally worth, even without a pool or hot tub. Oh yeah! You bring your stuff?<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Ikeda.jpg"/> Of course you have, haha. Oh, and you don’t need to call me senpai anymore. I’ve already graduated, remember? <br/>
<br/>
This game does away with most of the honorifics as compared to Persona 4, which just makes it weirder when they do pop up.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-RyujiBlue.png"/> Hm? He’s, uh… a friend! By the time he showed up, the track team was already… well, y’know.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Ikeda.jpg"/> Speaking of which, how’s your leg?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-RyujiBlue.png"/> Eh, I’m managin’… How ‘bout you, Senpai? You still runnin’?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Ikeda.jpg"/> I actually joined my university’s track team. You’d think I would’ve quit entirely after what happened…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-RyujiBlue.png"/> About that, I’m real sorry...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Ikeda.jpg"/> No, I should be the one apologizing.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Ikeda.jpg"/> I was supposed to be the leader of our team, yet I just resigned myself to Kamoshida’s will…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-RyujiBlue.png"/> That’s ‘cause you needed him to write your letter of rec, right? You were just lookin’ out for your future… but I still managed to eff it up anyways.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Ikeda.jpg"/> Kamoshida clearly never intended on writing my letter of recommendation. You were just his excuse not to. And honestly, I enjoy where I am now. The track team isn’t anything special, but it’s perfect for me. So in truth, I should be thanking you for what you did, Sakamoto.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-RyujiBlue.png"/> Senpai...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Ikeda.jpg"/> I’ve always regretted not doing more to protect you guys… But I heard some good news recently… The Shujin track team’s being reinstated!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Ikeda.jpg"/> I mean, Kamoshida confessed all the horrible stuff he did, right? I guess the school got the old team together and told them they want to try starting it up again.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-RyujiBlue.png"/> ...Nobody told me about that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Ikeda.jpg"/> Huh, odd… The rumors got as far as me, and I’m not even a student anymore. Anyway, I heard they’re going to get Mr. Yamauchi as their new advisor.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-RyujiBlue.png"/> Yamauchi…? Hold up, THAT Yamauchi!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Ikeda.jpg"/> Yup, the one who was basically Kamoshida’s lapdog. Apparently he volunteered. He’s really enthusiastic about pulling the track team up from the ashes.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-RyujiBlue.png"/> He is…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Ikeda.jpg"/> You know, now that the team is being reinstated, there’s no need for any bad blood, right? Why don’t you go talk to them? I’m sure they could use someone with your passion.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-RyujiBlue.png"/> ...Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Ikeda leaves.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-RyujiBlue.png"/> He’d always yell at us at practice, but then be a huge kiss-ass when our parents were around. Ugh, I can’t believe a moron like that’s gonna be advisin’ the track team. He doesn’t even teach PE! ...He’s gotta be up to something.

Let’s talk to the speech man again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-077.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Tora.png"/> Oh, you were working at the beef bowl shop before! You have a lot of perseverance for a young person. Well, if you’re interested, I could use your help. I want to change the state of this country, and to do so, I need the power of the youth. ...However, due to certain regulations, I can’t offer a job to a student. I was thinking you could learn some things if you chose to attend a few of my speeches though...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-078.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This sounds shady. I’m in.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Tora.png"/> Really!? That would be helpful indeed! Well then… would you mind telling me your name and contact information? You’re a student from Shujin Academy, hm? It’s nice to meet you. I am Toranosuke Yoshida. I used to be a member of the Diet… but no longer.<br/>
<br/>
The Diet is kind of like Japanese Congress, if you know nothing about Japanese government. I happen to know only slightly more than nothing, so I’m sure someone will respond telling me how that’s a really inaccurate analogy.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Tora.png"/> In the past twenty years, I’ve lost seven straight elections… This isn’t good. I’m dwelling on the negative right before my speech. Well then, I hope I can count on your help immediately.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Maaku looks so goofy holding that sign, though I have no idea what it says.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Tora.png"/> With common sense no longer our guide, we make decisions based on our selfish wants and desires. This has resulted in a deluge of self-centered people who delight in taking advantage of the weak.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Tora.png"/> A world where it is acceptable to trample on the rights of others for your own benefit… A world where the young exist only to be exploited… Is a world that must be changed!<br/>

Makoto’s got an interesting strategy when it comes to spying on me, in which she walks right up, asks me direct questions and then admits that she has been watching me and will continue to do so in the future. Genius play.<br/>

...Shit, I’m fucked aren’t I?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-Inui.png"/> Now then, pickng up from last time… The end of the Heian period marks the rise of the samurai, which I’m sure you’ve all been waiting for. As described in “The Tale of the Heike,” it was a time when all that was great would fall from grace. It wasn’t unusual for the heroes of yesterday to be struck down as rebels of the present day. By the sympathizing with the loser or the weak is called “magistrate’s patronage.” That term came from the name of the position that a certain hero held. Now then, Hamiru-kun. Who do you think is the origin of the term “magistrate’s patronage”?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-093.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-Inui.png"/> Exactly.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-Inui.png"/> Although Yoshitsune helped defeat the Taira, he was driven out by his brother and killed himself. However, in the centuries that followed, Yoshitsune became more popular as a tragic hero.<br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Knowledge +1</b>.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-Inui.png"/> Rather than siding with the one who has overwhelming power, people prefer the underdog opposing them. It’s sort of like rooting for a minor-league baseball team instead of an all-star, major-league one.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> I can understand that. It’s like, if I don’t root for them, then who will?<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="128-097.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ryuji.png"/> The hell’re you talkin’ about!? That’s a dog, man! And besides, it’s “daschund”! I actually know my dogs, dude!<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, they spelled “dachshund” wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ryuji.png"/> ...Anyways, Yamauchi’s the teacher who’s gonna end up bein’ the new <b>track team advisor</b>. He don’t give a rat’s ass about the sport though… or even the students. So, y’see, I heard this rumor… Apparently he’s got in trouble at school before with his drinkin’… but that hasn’t kept him from goin’ out. I was thinkin’, maybe he’d let some shit slip when he’s drunk. We should totally try and tail him sometime. I’ll look into where he goes to drink. What’s the plan for today though? You gonna train with me?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Protag.png"/> &gt;Hang out with him<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Ryuji.png"/> Let’s get changed then. We can meet at, uh… Hmmm, somewhere’s gotta be open. Let’s try lookin’ around at school.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="142-Accomplice.jpg"/> Huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="130-RyujiGym.png"/> Look… Even if Nakaoka was workin’ with Kamoshida… ain’t it fine now? The bastard’s gone, so you guys can just put this crap behind you. There’s no reason to fight, yeah…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="137-Takeishi.jpg"/> We can’t keep people around who’re gonna try and undermine our team.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="145-Nakaoka.jpg"/> But… I didn’t do anything. I wasn’t working with Kamoshida. No matter how much you hit me, my answer’s gonna stay the same.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="137-Takeishi.jpg"/> Oh yeah…? We’ve got proof. Yamauchi told us all about it.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="130-RyujiGym.png"/> But...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="145-Nakaoka.jpg"/> When you hit Kamoshida, you were really hitting all of us who tried so hard to endure his bullshit. You might’ve felt relieved, but it only made life harder for us… ‘Cause of you, we lost the one place we could vent our frustrations… the one place we could really belong. Tensions got pretty high after that… and things’ve just been kinda rough from then on. ...You really think it’s all fine now, huh? Well what if I told you they’re right about me…? Would you still think it’s “fine” if I was the one who told Kamoshida about your parents?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="130-RyujiGym.png"/> …… Yeah. If you told him, you told him. I’m over all that stuff with my parents anyways. Besides… I’ve realized something, Nakaoka. I might’ve messed up with Kamoshida back then, but hangin’ on to the past ain’t gonna help anythin’. I’m just gonna focus on bein’ myself now… on bein’ free.<br/>
