<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> Th-That is, a famous director was responsible for this movie. Who wouldn’t want to see it…? Why are you looking at me like that? Let’s go inside already!<br/>
<br/>
<b>Music:</b> A three second loop of “Sauna” from Persona 4<br/>

<br/>
Look how into this Makoto is. It’s adorable.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Gangster voice:</b> *laughing* You try to cut ties with me, then you come back for more? I’ll kill you! *two gunshots*<br/>
<b>Protagonist voice:</b> Boss! Boss! No… That bastard shot him! Boooooooss!<br/>
<br/>
In case it wasn’t already clear, “Like A Dragon” is the English translation of Ryu ga Gotoku, the Japanese name for the Yakuza series, also owned by Sega. The “famous director” Makoto mentioned is a reference to Takashi Miike, who directed the live-action movie based on the first game in the series.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> Makoto’s fists have been clenched this entire time… Whatever she said before about the director was probably just an excuse. She loves this stuff…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Protag.png"/> <i>I feel like I learned more about the determination that the yakuza have...</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-HifumiCasual.png"/> ...Huh? Um, please wash it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Man_5.jpg"/> I can’t believe that you’re really here… in a church… I read on the internet that you pray to God for victory. Is that true?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-HifumiCasual.png"/> No…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Man_5.jpg"/> Can I take a selfie with you and post it online?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-HifumiCasual.png"/> Sorry, I’ve been turning down all such requests…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Man_5.jpg"/> By the way, is it true that you’re trying to become a professional shogi player?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-HifumiCasual.png"/> Well, nothing’s been… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Man_5.jpg"/> I’ll be cheering for you to qualify! You’d be the first woman to surpass the third-dan league! I really believe in you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-HifumiCasual.png"/> ...Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-HifumiCasual.png"/> Men like that approach me all the time. At first, I thought you were one of them… ...I really must apologize for being rude to you… It bothers me when people make such a big fuss over me… Considering that the priest is doing me a great favor by letting me play here… You see, he’s my shogi friend. And he’s very kind. He once told me that he wanted to be a professional player. ...And he doesn’t laugh at my embarrassing habit when we play together.<br/>
<br/>
Hey! I only laugh at you internally!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-HifumiCasual.png"/> I’m embarrassed just thinking about it… Did you see it…? It was called “The Venus of Shogi”...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-014.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-HifumiCasual.png"/> Please stop… Ever since I won the female shogi league, I’ve been getting a lot of attention. I just figured I could contribute to the shogi world… Besides, my mother seems to be very happy… Whenever I win, she rejoices as if it were her own victory… So I want to live up to the expectations she has for me… ...However, she’s been a bit overzealous lately. She set up the interview and photoshoot. It’s as if she wants to be the manager of a celebrity.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-HifumiCasual.png"/> Today, I’ll be showing you something very practical… It’s a tactic for using the reserved pawns you’ve taken from your opponent in a more effective way. Nevertheless… I apologize. You’re such a good listener, I feel at ease speaking with you… Aside from the priest, you’re actually the first person I’ve spoken to about my mother…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Protag.png"/> <i>I feel Hifumi’s trust in me growing...</i><br/>

More opportunities for follow-up attacks, always nice. Basically, this skill allows the occasional chance for a backup party member to pop up and shoot the enemy with you to knock them down. <br/>

At any rate they’ve a strong impression on the hearts of the people. If this were a film, the Phantom Thieves got the opening sequence right. Let’s see what’s next. Well, I’ll be going home then.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-YusukeCollarless.png"/> The truth is, despite my best efforts to convey the meaning of the heart, I am no closer to understanding it. Such a troublesome roadblock never presented itself to me while I was living here… As you know, I spent most of my young life in this very house. That is why we have come now. I wish to reevaluate myself within its decrepit walls. By coming to this place, I may be able to rekindle the passion for art I once held. The passion of an inquiring mind on the hunt for pure beauty… before I learned of Madarame’s foul nature.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-YusukeCollarless.png"/> No… I surely left it unlocked. What…? The door has jammed!? Hm… I suppose it was quite an old door to begin with. It had begun to rust even while I was a pupil here. It seems now it has finally broken.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-YusukeCollarless.png"/> That is a nice idea, but I am unfortunately not the owner of the house. I cannot call a locksmith. I wish I could fix it myself… But I struggle with mechanisms as complex as this. I do not have the steady hand required to mend them.<br/>
<br/>
...You’re an <i>artist</i>.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Protag.png"/> <i>I need to fix the door… But I don’t think I’ll be able to with my current <b>Proficiency</b>… I might be able to fix it if my <b>Proficiency</b> were <b>Masterful</b>… </i><br/>
<br/>
Masterful is Rank 4, for the record.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-YusukeCollarless.png"/> Hm… This is a difficult problem. It seems we have no choice but to retreat for today.<br/>
<br/>
And so the great and powerful Phantom Thieves are obstructed by a broken door. This event is unique, however, in that it lets us go right back to roaming instead of consuming time.<br/>

So instead, we head over to Big Bang Burger to partake in the feast of our people.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The lady informs us that the special promotion (where the trial only costs 500 yen) does not apply because it’s not night, but we don’t care.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-BBB_Employee.jpg"/> As you are a Second Mate, the difficulty of the mission will be increased. The challenge will cost 1500 yen.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-BBB_Employee.jpg"/> As you have moved up to the rank of Second Mate… this is your next foe!<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> Holy crap! It’s humongous...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-BBB_Employee.jpg"/> This is the Gravity Burger… A burger so large that it almost has its own gravitational field. Once again, this will be no easy feat to overcome. But should you conquer this challenge, you will be rewarded with an extravagant prize.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> So this one comes with a prize too… Do your best, Maaku!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-BBB_Employee.jpg"/> Well then, it’s time to get the thirty-minute Big Bang Challenge started! Ready… Go!<br/>

<br/>
It gives you +30 HP. It’s also garbage.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-BBB_Employee.jpg"/> Enjoy your new rank as First Mate. However, one mission still remains… I look forward to your next attempt at our challenge!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> You defeated the Gravity Burger this time… You’re incredible. You were so admirable, taking on such a daunting task with that intense level of courage!<br/>

<br/>
All right, we can finally turn in that fucking paper bag to Iwai… when I feel like it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> Your pace, your strategy of using well-timed drinks, and just the spectacular way you devoured it… Everything was perfect!<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Murmur.jpg"/> Medjed hasn’t taken any action either…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Chatter.jpg"/> I heard some company’s private data got leaked or something. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Chatter.jpg"/> Did Medjed do that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Whisper.jpg"/> Are the Phantom Thieves sitting on their hands!? Do something!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Yes, it seems the private dealings of a large corporation were publicly disclosed.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Indeed. I doubt they’d do anything before the deadline they imposed on us. This seems to be just a minor thing. Quite different from what Medjed has done up until now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Is that so?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-RyujiChat.png"/> So it wasn’t Medjed? Damn, that shit freaked me out!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-AnnChat.png"/> It’s honestly kind of hard not having a knee-jerk reaction to this stuff nowadays… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Sometimes people react to these situations by pleading for help from the Phantom Thieves.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-MakotoChat.jpg"/> We need to find a way to stand up for them…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-TV.jpg"/> The Phantom Thieves, however, have gained popularity on the internet as “allies of justice.” Support for them is growing, with some saying they are the only ones who can defeat Medjed. The world will be watching what the Phantom Thieves do before the deadline on August 21st.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> Everyone’s counting on us. We can’t let them down.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-ToraNoSash.png"/> Most people who want to get into politics are jealous of them.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Matsushita.jpg"/> What about you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-ToraNoSash.png"/> However they manage to change hearts, I respect their belief in crushing evil and saving the weak.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Matsushita.jpg"/> Isn’t that similar to what you advocate?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-ToraNoSash.png"/> I can’t deny that. But that’s not why I support them… I bet they’re a group of young people. Young people who have experienced cruelty and injustice… They bravely face the societal ills that plague our world without thinking of the consequences. Brave, yet pitiful… I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Tora…<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-ToraNoSash.png"/> ...Is this what you asked me here to speak to me about?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Matsushita.jpg"/> No… The party has decided which candidates it will back in the various electoral zones.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-ToraNoSash.png"/> And…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Matsushita.jpg"/> One of our main candidates will represent this area, according to the party’s election strategy. You have no chance of winning.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Matsushita.jpg"/> I won’t beat around the bush. Drop out of the election, and become my right-hand man.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Matsushita.jpg"/> It won’t be for naught. I’ll put in a motion to have you reinstated as a party member. And I will perform an extensive investigation into your expense misappropriation accusations.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
We could use the Charm, but we have other plans today.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-YusukeCollarless.png"/> Very well. Be sure to contact the others if you wish to hold a meeting. Ah, and you needn’t mind me. I will simply be here gazing at the “Sayuri” in the meantime.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, Yusuke, but it’s cool that you’re chill about it. One good thing about this game is that people (generally, there are some exceptions) don’t get super bummed when you don’t put them in the party or hang out.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-HifumiCasual.png"/> It’s even hotter this summer. You have more aptitude for this than I imagined. I also sense an ambitious spirit within you. I should’ve taken into account your improvement throughout our lessons. I have something in mind, but let’s play a match first… In fact, let’s play right now.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-HifumiCasual.png"/> Today I thought we’d find you something to help you train on your own. This bookstore is filled with shogi-related books. I’ve been coming here a lot lately. There’s also a curry restaurant just around the corner. I recommend their katsu curry. I always eat katsu curry before an important match… for good luck.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Almond-eyed_Woman.jpg"/> Out shopping with your boyfriend? Hmph, how nice for you. I shouldn’t be surprised. You ARE a famous shogi player, after all. Well, I won’t intrude. Bye...<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-HifumiCasual.png"/> Yes! I did have katsu curry before that match. The truth is… I’m not very well liked by my seniors… The more attention I get, the more enemies I make, and the more lies are spread about me… Perhaps it’s odd to compare myself to them, but… I wonder if it’s the same for the Phantom Thieves.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-HifumiCasual.png"/> People are so divided about them on the internet. Some love them, while others hate them… I can’t help but see similarities between us. What do you think about them?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-089.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Man, this session has been all about people just randomly asking us about the Phantom Thieves. Do you think they’re onto us?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-HifumiCasual.png"/> It’s amazing that they’re still doing what they do, even though so many people criticize them… They give me courage. But their victories can’t be won with will alone… How do they change a person’s heart…? I’m interested from a tactical standpoint, and… Oh, I’m sorry! We really are quite off-topic… I feel like I’ve become much more talkative as of late. I usually don’t talk this much… You’re more than just someone I can practice new moves with. You’re someone I can confide in. Um, if you don’t mind this sort of thing… I’d like to go out and chat with you again.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-HifumiCasual.png"/> Oh yes, there’s a book that I’d love for you to read. Let’s go. Well then, until our next match. Take care.<br/>
<br/>
No Knowledge boost today, despite us explicitly having played a match. What a ripoff.
