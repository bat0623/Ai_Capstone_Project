<br/>
Let’s just ignore all the catastrophic shit that went down and enjoy the rest of the culture festival. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-002.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-HaruChat.jpg"/> I tried to think about what happened earlier, but that has gotten me nowhere… So, I could use a change of pace. How about it? <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We don’t actually get an option here, but if we had chosen a romantic partner by now, we would. If you have no romance options, you’re locked into Haru, but if you have any of the “school” options (read: Ann, Makoto, or *sigh* yes, Kawakami) you’ll be able to hang out with them. <s>Weirdly, having a romantic partner is also a prerequisite for unlocking the last available option, Ryuji and Mishima, meaning you have to neglect your girlfriend in order to hang out with… <i>them.</i></s> Apparently, you just need Ryuji maxed to unlock Ryuji and Mishima as an option. Anyway, Haru is our only option right now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-HaruChat.jpg"/> I’ll be waiting at the gymnasium. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Protag.png"/> <i>I should head to the gym...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Boy_6.jpg"/> Everybody give them another round of applause!<br/>
<br/>
There are light, scattered smatterings of applause.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Haru.png"/> I’m sorry. I can’t stop thinking about what Akechi-kun said… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Haru.png"/> *giggle* It feels like nothing bad could ever happen when you say that. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Protag.png"/> *nods*<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Boy_6.jpg"/> Round of applause, everyone!<br/>
<br/>
More light applause.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Haru.png"/> Sharing…? I never knew we had such an event. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Boy_6.jpg"/> All right, who has something to say? Anyone, anyone!? No, I’ll just have to pick someone then! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Haru.png"/> Ooh, he’s going to choose? I wonder who it will be…<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I also wonder who ever it could be. *wink*<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
wah waaaaaaah<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-011.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Haru.png"/> Is he… looking this way? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Boy_6.jpg"/> Well then, come on up! <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-013.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Haru.png"/> So it really is me… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Boy_6.jpg"/> Come, come. Everyone’s waiting! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Haru.png"/> Well, I’m going. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The MC somehow didn’t recognize the only girl in school who wears a pink sweater over her uniform.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Haru.png"/> Um, yes… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The crowd starts cheering, saying stuff like “She’s so cool” and yelling “Senpaaaaaai!”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Boy_6.jpg"/> U-Uhhh… I’m sure you’re, um… still grieving… My, um… deepest apologies… <br/>
<br/>
Oh god, this is gonna be painful.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This scene has a disproportionate amount of the “sweating” emote, so I’ll just call them out in-text from now on instead of screenshotting all of them.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Haru.png"/> Oh, please don’t worry!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Boy_6.jpg"/> So uh, do you have anything you’d like to share with us? <br/>
<br/>
Haru sweats. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Haru.png"/> Something to share… I have too many things… <br/>
<br/>
The MC sweats, now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Boy_6.jpg"/> Err… Here, let me give you a question then… Do you think the Phantom Thieves are really Shujin students? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
What the hell, man? This is the worst culture festival ever!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Haru.png"/> Huh?<br/>
<br/>
The crowd gets lively.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Boy_6.jpg"/> I mean, they are… uh… your father’s killers…<br/>
<br/>
Tactful Student strikes again!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Boy_6.jpg"/> We’re all dying to know what Akechi-kun was going to say about their true identities. So, are they from Shujin? What do you think, Okumura-san?<br/>
<br/>
Why would she know!?<br/>
<br/>
Haru sweats. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Haru.png"/> Erm… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Protag.png"/> <i>Haru is in trouble… I need to change the subject…</i><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Haru.png"/> Well… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-022.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Boy_6.jpg"/> Now this is drama! A boy caught in the throes of bittersweet youth! A stunning confession of love! <br/>
<br/>
The crowd becomes lively once more, and Haru sweats… twice.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Boy_6.jpg"/> I think it was him! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Boy_6.jpg"/> Sooo, Okumura-san! What’s your relation to this guy? <br/>
<br/>
Haru sweats again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Haru.png"/> Th-That wasn’t what we were talking about… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Boy_6.jpg"/> My, she’s quite flustered! IS this a hot scoop!?<br/>
<br/>
Someone call in Newspaper Club Member, stat!<br/>
<br/>
The crowd laughs. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Boy_6.jpg"/> But I’m a gentleman. It hurts my heart to bully such a sweet girl! Well, did you all enjoy our blushing beauty? Thank you very much, Okumura-san! <br/>
<br/>
The crowd moans, and someone yells, “Just when it was getting interesting!”<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Haru.png"/> It turned out to be more like an interview party, huh? I still can’t believe you said that… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Haru.png"/> Huh…? Right… At any rate… I’m not sure what I would have done without you. Thank you for saving me. You’re a mysterious person, but you’re so reliable. I think the two of us will get along quite well in the future…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
What? Well fuck you too, I guess!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Haru.png"/> Who knows what may lie ahead. For now, I’m worried about what happened with Akechi-kun… But I have to say, my first post-festival party was quite fun. Though… I guess it’s my last too. Here, I’d like you to have this.<br/>
<br/>

The Sakura Amezaiku restores 100 SP to one ally. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Haru.png"/> I… bought it earlier… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Haru.png"/> *giggle* Now then, let’s go home. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Chatter.jpg"/> Yeah, there’s been a sudden increase. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Chatter.jpg"/> I bet it’s because of that Phan-Site.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Whisper.jpg"/> I heard the victims were on the rankings there.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Chatter.jpg"/> We should really be blaming the people who requested it.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> You took off somewhere during the festival, huh… I tried to find you, but I gave up pretty quickly. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-MorganaSad.png"/> Futaba? What are you doing here in front of the store…?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> Not just Akechi, but other stuff too. We’re in deep trouble unless we can do something soon. But anyway, I was just thinking about going inside, so your timing is perfect. Let’s go. <br/>
<br/>
How convenient for the upcoming scene!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-SIU_Director.png"/> “No Countermeasure for the Phantom Thieves,” “The Sorry State of the Police,” “Destruction of Safety”… They’re saying whatever they want. So, how’s the investigation progressing? Any clues yet?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Sae.png"/> Nothing that leads to a firm conviction yet… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-SIU_Director.png"/> What’s going on here? Didn’t you say that you were sure about closing this case? And I thought I told you that failure won’t be tolerated. <br/>
<br/>
It’s been like a week, dude. Chill the fuck out.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Sae.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-SIU_Director.png"/> Well, this is troublesome. If things continue at this rate, never mind a promotion… we’d have to let you go entirely. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-SIU_Director.png"/> I had high expectations for you, but it seems this task was too much to handle for someone so young.<br/>
<br/>
Man, fuck this dude.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-SIU_Director.png"/> We may need to reform the operation as well since the selected personnel for this--<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-SIU_Director.png"/> I know that you’ve been at this for a while now, even before the police spared us the staff for it. If you can manage an arrest, I’ve made special arrangements so that you can question them personally. ...That’s what you want, isn’t it? <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ominous!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-SIU_Director.png"/> I’ll make myself clear again: Failure isn’t an option. We need results. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Sae.png"/> ...I understand. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-SIU_Director.png"/> You’re allowed to take some… bold measures if you need to. We need good results, no matter what. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Sae.png"/> ...To you, sir? <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> This is a calling card, right? I’ve read about it online too. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> Y-You went into my room without my permission!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> I’ll apologize as much as you want later. ...So, what is this? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> That’s… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> Is it something to get flustered over? I knew it. This isn’t just some “game” you’re playing. Why aren’t you saying anything? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> I mean… it was memorable… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> Explain.<br/>
<br/>
Sojiro slams the counter.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> Is it something that you can’t explain? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> Ex...plain…<br/>
<br/>
Futaba sounds like she can barely speak, and is clearly on the verge of tears. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-MorganaSquint.png"/> Hey, if this keeps up, Futaba’s--<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> You will, huh? I’ll get right to the point. ...Is this a “real” one? Was a… well… a “change of heart” triggered in you? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> *sob*<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> How about it?<br/>
<br/>
Chief Hardass here is gonna (further) traumatize his daughter, holy shit.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> ...Ever since… Mom died… there was… no exit… …I was trapped… in a labyrinth of… my heart…<br/>
<br/>
Overly poetic language is maybe the wrong choice to get through to Sojiro. No offense to the dude, but he seems like the kind of guy whose brain would explode if he looked at a sufficiently daring painting. No offense to the “Sayuri” intended.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> I knew I… had to leave it… but I… I couldn’t do it… by myself… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> Futaba… *shakes head* Here… Sit down. I can at least listen to what you have to say. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> It’s the same as Mom’s research… They changed… my cognition… *sobs*<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> Seriously…? …… Wakaba’s research about altering one’s cognition… I wondered about it myself too, but still… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> When she said she was gonna go to the beach out of nowhere. Even the doctors had thrown in the towel.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> <i>(quiet crying)</i> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> At first I just chalked it up as other kids being a better support for you than any adult. But as I kept watching the tabloid shows here day in and day out, a thought crossed my mind… I thought… your case kind of seemed similar to what those Phantom Thieves were doing. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> …Wow. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> I’m still your guardian, you know. I’d never overlook such a drastic change in your behavior. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> Sojiro… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> But to think that Wakaba’s research and the Phantom Thieves changing hearts were about the same thing. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> My job was to be the bridge between the country and the lab that Wakaba worked at. It’s around that time that I got to know her. She said something odd when we were out drinking… That… she might soon die in an odd way. Who wouldn’t take that as a joke? I just laughed it off…<br/>
<br/>
“Hey I might soon die suspiciously”<br/>
“Lol, you’re so funny Wakaba”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> But… it happened exactly as she said. If anything were to happen to you, I’d feel like I let her down. There’s something I want to ask you, Maaku. Judging from your attitude, you knew about this calling card, didn’t you? You should’ve known that Futaba had a change of heart through the Phantom Thieves as well. ...Is there a connection between you and them? The first incident of a change of heart was a teacher at your school. The kid who brought that painting here was a pupil of that artist who had a change of heart, wasn’t he? And then there’s Futaba… These scandals always seem to find their way around you… What do you have to say? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> …… These people are called criminals by the general public. Why did you introduce such dangerous people to Futaba!? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> I asked them! That’s why Maaku saved me! He stole my heart!<br/>
<br/>
Welp, the cat’s outta the bag now, I guess. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> ...Asked? Stole? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> Wait, are you saying that he’s the one who changed your heart?<br/>
<br/>
If we started a drinking game for the word “heart” we’d get plastered in this scene faster than in a fucking Kingdom Hearts game.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> So, he’s not connected with the Phantom Thieves, but is one himself…? You’re pulling my leg, aren’t you? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-057.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> You… really are a Phantom Thief? For crying out loud… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> Sojiro… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> So basically, I’ve been sheltering a Phantom Thief for the last six months? And on top of that, Futaba’s involved too… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> I… I want to find the culprit who killed my mom…!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, we’re just gonna lay it all out there, huh? I should probably confess the teacher-maid thing, then, even if it’s over at this point. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> She was killed! I… remember it now. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> Stop this nonsense!<br/>
<br/>
Dude, you just said she died in a ludicrously suspicious manner.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> Why won’t you believe me!? Are you the same as everyone else? Didn’t you know already!? The way Mom died wasn’t normal! Didn’t you notice that her research was stolen by someone!? Sojiro…! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> ...When she passed away, I did think it was odd. It was awfully fishy. But what could I do? ...All I was able to do was run from it all. And the outcome of that… was me spending my retirement here. Also the reason I took custody of you was… me trying to selfishly atone for what happened to Wakaba. It’s basically my fault that you got burdened with all this crap. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> It’s not your fault, Sojiro.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> I acted all big, lectured, even yelled at you kids… And in the end, I’m the one being consoled. I’m hopeless and a laughingstock, aren’t I? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> I mean, the one who killed Mom is the one at fault! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> …… …I see. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Fuck yeah. This is a top-tier Fake Dad. Dojima was an all right Fake Dad, but he was too suspicious of us. And then who the fuck is P3’s Fake Dad? Akihiko? No. Ikutsuki? Gross.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> I mean, who would believe such a story? Unless they catch you red-handed, it’s impossible to explain that you’re the Phantom Thieves. Let me just say one thing though. Immediately back out of a fight that you can’t win. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> Don’t you get it? If by chance you pissed off the same guys that killed Wakaba… Then they’re not someone that kids like you can deal with. Listen to reason, all right? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Sojiro.png"/> Let’s eat. I’m so hungry ‘cause I raised my voice so much… <br/>
<br/>
That’ll be awkward!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-MorganaSquint.png"/> ...Still, we should tell the others about what just happened. <br/>
<br/>

Ryuji! You said (well, typed) fuck again! That’s two strikes! You know what’ll happen if you violate the court order!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-AnnChat.png"/> Wait, are you OK? Did he report you or anything?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-YusukeChat.jpg"/> We likely wouldn’t be receiving these messages if Maaku was not OK. I had a feeling that Boss was no ordinary man… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-HaruChat.jpg"/> But he didn’t recommend you turn yourself in, did he? I think in that case we can consider him a new ally.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-YusukeChat.jpg"/> I’m more curious about what he mentioned to you. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-HaruChat.jpg"/> You mean how our enemy might be the same people who targeted Futaba’s mother?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Yes. She was killed by mental shutdown, the same method used by the culprit we pursue now. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-AnnChat.png"/> Wait a second though… Didn’t you say Boss had to “run from it all”…? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-RyujiChat.png"/> Ain’t you letting your imagination run wild a bit? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-YusukeChat.jpg"/> But it would make sense.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-RyujiChat.png"/> Wait a sec! If you’re right, then wouldn’t the police be working for ‘em too!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-MakotoChat.jpg"/> ...That’s not impossible.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-AnnChat.png"/> This is getting too big for me to even think about…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-HaruChat.jpg"/> Can we really win this?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> We’re gonna win, no matter what! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> *nods*<br/>

Oh man, with that wide anime mouth I’m sure he could review the shit out of that amiibo<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-TV.jpg"/> All the food’s so good, it’s hard to choose! This is the place to go when you splurge in Shibuya! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Chatter.jpg"/> I heard all sorts of celebrities and even political big shots go there undercover to eat. The man who everyone says will be the next prime minister goes there too. I’d love to go try it out! <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-077.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> All this happened because I kept the calling card… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-078.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> Is Sojiro still awake? This is kind of awkward… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-MorganaAngry.png"/> Wait, shouldn’t you sleep on the sofa, so that Futaba can go ahead and sleep on the bed? <br/>
<br/>
<sub>shut up dude I have back problems</sub><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-FutabaJacket.png"/> …… ...I’m gonna go home. Night. <br/>
