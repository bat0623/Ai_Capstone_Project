Sorry about the hiatus, guys. This Palace is just… something of a trial. Also I asked Ari if he wanted to do it instead and he said no. Also, my computer’s been acting up lately. But enough of the excuses, let’s just… oh nooooooooooosdfgjkslegsd’aosdfksglk;weoi[fds……...<b>….hello<br/>
<br/>
is this working? <br/>
<br/>
it would seem so<br/>
<br/>
all right then, hack successful</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Hax.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
Wait, what the fuck is going on?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hacker.jpg"/> shut up. you’re being hacked. you shouldn’t even be able to see this<br/>
<br/>
You’re typing this into a word document, dude. This isn’t a command line. You seem weirdly bad at this.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hacker.jpg"/> well, i’m not the one who compromised his entire system by downloading suspicious font packs, idiot. now shut up if you’re not gonna tell me what your passwords are, i’m trying to get into your bank account<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn’t waste my time, I have maybe fourteen bucks in there. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hacker.jpg"/> then send my virus to one of your friends!<br/>
<br/>
We’re having this conversation in the overlong preamble to part <b>one hundred and nine</b> of a Persona 5 Let’s Play that’s lasted over a year. I clearly don’t have any friends. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hacker.jpg"/> that’s true. most of the files on this system are video games and shitty pirated anime… ugh<br/>
<br/>
Face it, you have nothing to gain here.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hacker.jpg"/> i refuse to give up! give me your money!<br/>
<br/>
No. Now, if you don’t mind, I’ve got an audience of dozens waiting for me to horribly embarrass myself. Goodbye.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hacker.jpg"/> i’m staying, dickwad. hope your lp can survive my bullshit<br/>
<br/>
It survives my own bullshit constantly, so I think it’ll be fine.<br/>

Okay, so, when we last left off, Makoto was just leveling up, learning Mafreila to replace Mafrei, as it’s a straight upgrade. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Noir.jpg"/> (Haru) He disappeared! Is that OK?<br/>
<br/>
What did you do to my <i>portraits,</i> dude?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hacker.jpg"/> oh, i deleted a bunch of files. nothing important, just some tiny pictures. what, you need that shit? good.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone’s a fucking twelve-year-old around here, christ. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Panther.jpg"/> (Ann) Are you sure you taught her how things work in here? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Mona.jpg"/> (Morgana) I did… or so I thought… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> (Futaba) What’s the point if she doesn’t get it? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> (Makoto) Don’t worry. Cognitive beings have no correlation to their real-world counterparts. You’ll see when we get back. I guarantee he will be OK. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Noir.jpg"/> Then, he’s not dead? <br/>
<br/>
This all sounds like shit to worry about <i>before</i> you murder him.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Fox.jpg"/> (Yusuke) That’s right.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Skull.jpg"/> (Ryuji) Dude, does this mean we got a new teammate? Good to have ya… uh… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Mona.jpg"/> She already has a code name. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Skull.jpg"/> ...Noir? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Noir.jpg"/> It means black in French. I’d like to be a heroine of justice, but the Phantom Thieves are on the darker side of the law. I chose the name Noir to remind me of that. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Mona.jpg"/> ...There you have it. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Panther.jpg"/> As long as she’s into it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Fox.jpg"/> She created quite an elaborate backstory… <br/>
<br/>
These guys are weirdly down about her choice of name. I think it sounds cool.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hacker.jpg"/> you would<br/>
<br/>
Oh, shut up.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> Noir. I like it. It conveys a dignity that won’t bow down to others, as well as a rebellious spirit towards society.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, maybe it’s not that cool.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Noir.jpg"/> Thank you. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Mona.jpg"/> Don’t let your guard down, Noir. Our trip through the Palace doesn’t end until we steal the Treasure, after all. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Noir.jpg"/> Yes, sir! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> Someone’s talkin’ all big again… <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This is a good song. Let’s see how it holds up for the next <i>four hours!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hacker.jpg"/> four hours? jesus, why do this to yourself<br/>
<br/>
I actually enjoy this game.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hacker.jpg"/> it doesn’t sound like it!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Before we move out, let’s make an adjustment...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Party.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
There we go.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hacker.jpg"/> why are you mean to the cat<br/>
<br/>
He knows what he did.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-009.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Fox.jpg"/> Hm, that seems quite far off… It is difficult to ascertain the shortest route there as well. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> We’ll just have to keep going on whatever path we find for the time being… Let’s go. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-2___003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
A bit further in, we find a door that won’t open. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> No, this one isn’t a biometric authentication… but it might be hard to open it from here. We’ll probably need to look for a server or a terminal if we wanna break through. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Skull.jpg"/> A server, huh… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-2___004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The entrance to the server room is cleverly hidden by a vent about six yards away. I make fun, but I totally missed this on my first playthrough and it was very embarrassing.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-2___005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Panther.jpg"/> That’s such a boyish thing to say.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Noir.jpg"/> Oh, there’s a room like this at the office. It’s called the server room. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Mona.jpg"/> What are all these machines even used for…? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-2___007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> Mwehehe… Watch this… All right, that should’ve opened up a buncha doors! I managed to grab a map of the place too.<br/>
<br/>
Hey Mr. Hacker, how does it feel to see this fifteen-year-old girl do your job better than you?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hacker.jpg"/> pff, this shit is so watered-down and inaccurate. now if you’ll excuse me, i have to do a hack via cyberspace to crash the corporate mainframe<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-2___008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> I dunno about that… There are three more areas ahead: the barracks, the factory, and the airlock area… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-2___009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
They’re just giving us the entire map at this point and not even bothering with finding it in pieces, because they totally gave up on that idea I guess.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> I was wondering about that too. Actually, I found one other interesting file when I was cracking into the system. It’s called “Project: Escape to Utopia”… There was some kinda blueprint inside too. It looks like whatever they’re making for it is ginormous. That factory can’t just be for burgers. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> Escape to Utopia… What do you think that’s supposed to mean…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Skull.jpg"/> It ain’t gonna matter if we can steal the Treasure and make this Palace disappear! Let’s hurry! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-2_-_010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Outside of the server room, we come an elevator that does not respond.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Skull.jpg"/> Don’t this look like an elevator? It ain’t doin’ anything though. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> But it doesn’t seem to be completely out of order either. Perhaps it’s at another floor. Let’s try coming back later. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hacker.jpg"/> that’s not how elevators work<br/>
<br/>
I thought you weren’t paying attention?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hacker.jpg"/> there’s nothing on netflix<br/>
<br/>
You should wa—wait, fuck you, I’m not giving you recommendations. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-2___011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Further in...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-2___012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Skull.jpg"/> Ugh, it still ain’t openin’ even after all of Oracle’s tinkerin’!? That bastard really doesn’t trust anybody, huh? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Panther.jpg"/> Skull…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Noir.jpg"/> It’s all right. Father is clearly guilty of some horrible crimes… That’s why we will stop him. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> We’ll still need to think of a way to get past here though. Can you figure something out, Oracle? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> If it’s not a normal lock or a biometric one, I think it might call for rank authentication. Basically, you have to be at least a chief director to get through here. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-2_-_013.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-2___014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Noir.jpg"/> Oh, you mean an <b>employee ID</b>! Those are used to authorize entry in the real world company as well.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Panther.jpg"/> You two are so smart! That’s gotta be it! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> Then it’s decided. Let’s find an employee that’s the rank of chief director or higher and take their employee ID! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-2___015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Back by the elevator, robots exit.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Skull.jpg"/> Look, there’re a ton of ‘em… You wanna start takin’ their IDs? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Fox.jpg"/> Not yet. If we go instead to their origin, there should be even more “employees” for us. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> Oh, great idea. That should make it even easier to find a chief director! Let’s head there, Joker. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-2_-_016.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-2___017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> All right, let’s go about this carefully. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-2___018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> I did a scan of the area, but there are multiple large readings around here. They’re definitely different from normal robots, so it’s prolly one of them. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Noir.jpg"/> So we’ll need to find which one is the real one? But how exactly will we do that…? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-2_-_019.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-2_-_020.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-2_-_021.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-2___022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Skull.jpg"/> Heh, perfect timin’. Let’s try askin’ them about this director guy. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Fox.jpg"/> That would be a foolish move. They’d report us immediately if they spotted us. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> Fox is right. We’ll need to think of a way to glean info from them without asking. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-2___023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Just walk up and eavesdrop like we do every day in real life!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Skull.jpg"/> Huh… So we’re basically eavesdroppin’ on ‘em… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> It’s a divine skill of mine.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Panther.jpg"/> Impressive. I can see how you managed to wiretap Leblanc for so long… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> That? Oh, that was nothing! Someday I’ll show you what real wiretapping is… Mwehehe… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> I-In any case, there’s no denying that this is a smart move. We’ll just have to obtain information from the group about <b>what their boss is like</b>.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Fox.jpg"/> There appear to be a few of them further in. Let us go obtain their information as well! <br/>
<br/>
This first room, which we’ll call “1,” has three more bots for us to eavesdrop on:<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> I WONDER HOW THE <b>CHIEF CLERK</b> GOT THAT POSITION…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> NO MATTER HOW MUCH I WORK, THERE’S ALWAYS MORE TO DO… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> THIS JOB JUST NEVER ENDS… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> We’ve heard a good amount… What do you think, Joker? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Joker.jpg"/> (Maaku) I’d like to listen more./<b>&gt;I know all I need to know.</b><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> Then let’s get out of here before we get caught. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-2___024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Skull.jpg"/> But that’s on the chief clerk, yeah? We’re lookin’ for dirt on the chief director, remember? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> We don’t have to target that director guy right away though. We can go from the bottom up.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> Now that you mention it, I doubt we could reach the chief director immediately regardless. We don’t have any employee IDs, so accessing the more secure areas would be impossible. <br/>
<br/>
Oh god, this is gonna take forever.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hacker.jpg"/> like you have anything better to do<br/>
<br/>
You just said you don’t have anything better to do either, dude! Ugh, can’t believe I’m getting roasted by this script kiddie.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hacker.jpg"/> script kiddie!? you’ll pay for that one<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I’m so scared.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Mona.jpg"/> Well, for now let’s just identify the chief clerk with the info we have. And if there are any more rooms that you think we can get info from, be sure to stop in! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-2___025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It’s at about this point that I think to indulge what I’m pretty sure is a myth about Futaba. Some people think her Luck stat affects the rate of her skill procs, which is why they let her equip accessories. I don’t think this is true and they just let you do it because fuck it, effort is hard. I thought I’d bring it up, however. I give her the accessory anyway because who cares, right?<br/>
<br/>
Also it’s at about this point that I realize I only have three SP Adhesive 3s for some reason, having never actually bought a fourth for Ryuji, meaning he and Haru are gonna have to trade theirs back and forth for the entire dungeon! Hooray! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-2_-_026.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-2___027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I don’t usually make too much note of safe rooms, but we’ll be visiting this one in particular a few times for reasons I’ll go into. Just know that if you ever play this game you should probably make note of this one.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-2___028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This big one-eyed elephant (no, that’s not slang for penis) is Girihmekhala. He’s weak to Bless and repels Physical and Gun, the second enemy in this Palace to do so. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-2_-_029.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-2___030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
One robot...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-2___031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and then another.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Panther.jpg"/> There are two of the same robot!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> Didn’t I tell you I was getting multiple signals? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Panther.jpg"/> Moving on, we saw one of those red ones giving instructions to the smaller robots, right…? Does that mean that one of them is the chief director? Or just the chief clerk…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Fox.jpg"/> Hm, should we defeat them both and take their employee IDs to find out? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> There’s no need to waste our energy like that. If we can <b>talk</b> to each one and compare what they say to the <b>intel</b> we have on hand… We might be able to tell what rank they are. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, so I took a screenshot of the map of this floor in order to more easily keep track of all the robits and the clues they give us. Wait… where is it?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hacker.jpg"/> yeah i deleted that shit lol<br/>
<br/>
...fuck. Well, I guess I’ll just have to remake it, then. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Map.png"/><br/>
<br/>
Perfect. I feel no need to leave this unspoiled: we do, in fact, have to do this three times.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-2_-_036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
First, let’s go to 2 and get more information. Also Shadow Okumura just looks fucking dope.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hacker.jpg"/> he looks like an unmasked scooby-doo villain<br/>
<br/>
Here are the fruits of our eavesdropping:<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> APPARENTLY HIS STOMACH IS DONE FOR. MAYBE THEY’LL DISPOSE OF HIM. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> SOMEDAY I’M GOING TO MOVE UP THE LADDER AND MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> OW… MY HIP HURTS. I WISH I COULD TAKE A DAY OFF… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> I HEAR THE CHIEF CLERK’S BEEN <b>STRESSED OUT</b> LATELY. <br/>
<br/>
So, we have stress and sweets. Let’s head over to A.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-2___032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> If they find out who we are, we’ll be forced to fight. Be cautious.<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Noir.jpg"/> We won’t be able to avoid a fight at this rate. Let’s go, Joker! <br/>
<br/>
Goddammit. Rewind!<br/>

<br/>
...Well, rewind by suiciding. I’ve never actually seen this message before, but it seems to pop up when an enemy successfully escapes, as one did when I failed to die fighting it to reset the puzzle. Also uhhh, the visible mouse cursor in this image is from the hacker. Shut up.<br/>
<br/>
Let’s try that again. Back to A.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-2___040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-ClerkBot.jpg"/> WHAT A BORING GIFT! WHEN I SAID PROFIT, I WAS SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING MORE VALUABLE!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> It is time we make our decision, Joker. What do you want to do? Should we fight him for his employee ID? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-2_-_041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Hmm… he doesn’t seem to like sweets. Let’s check the other one. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-2___042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We also find the door to the next area on the way to B. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> Yeah, you’ve gotta be a chief clerk or higher. Basically, we’ll need an employee ID card for this. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Skull.jpg"/> Ugh, you gotta be kiddin’ me! Are all companies like this!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Noir.jpg"/> …I believe our security in the real world is even stricter. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Skull.jpg"/> You serious…? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-2_-_043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And we make it to B. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-2___044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-ClerkBot.jpg"/> IS THAT SO? YOU MUST BE HARD WORKERS IF YOU’VE COME TO SELL WITHOUT AN APPOINTMENT. I’LL GLADLY LISTEN TO WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY. NOW THEN… DID YOU BRING ANY GIFTS FOR ME? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-2___045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-ClerkBot.jpg"/> AH, YOU ARE QUITE IN THE KNOW. I’M A CONNOISSEUR OF ALL THINGS <b>SWEET</b>. I CAN’T HELP BUT CHOW DOWN ON THEM WHEN I’M <b>STRESSED</b>!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-2___046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Definitely the right one, here. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Mona.jpg"/> Right, there’s no need for any more discussion. Take him down! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-2_-_035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The grunts will use Triple Down and Recarmdra, and are weak to Fire and Wind. The big boss is weak to Nuke and will summon more grunts and use Heavy magic attacks.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to take these guys down is to do as much damage as possible as fast as possible—sounds obvious, but these things’ll wreck you with repeated Triple Down if you give them an inch. If they have to heal with Recarmdra, they’ll all want to use it to heal each other from there, and you can take them down more easily.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-2_-_047.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-2___048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> But we’re looking for one that’s chief director or higher, yes? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> This one should be OK for now. At the very least it’ll help us get to some new places. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Fox.jpg"/> Yes, we can now enter areas restricted to those of chief clerk rank or higher now.<br/>
<br/>
Redundancy? How redundant!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-2___049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Intercom.jpg"/> EVERYONE, MOVE STATIONS! CONTINUE WORKING UNTIL YOU DIE! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-2___050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Skull.jpg"/> Wait, what? Shifts…? Hm, it said to move stations… Perhaps the rooms we have already entered will have different robots. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Mona.jpg"/> We should go check it out. Oh, and don’t forget to look for places we can get into with that fancy new employee ID card. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, so, not only do we have to search for three different tiers of ID card, but we have to search through all the old rooms for new boss Shadows and new information! It’s a nightmare! This is the reason I advised keeping the safe room handy, by the way—we want the checkpoints because we’ll almost certainly die at least once to a <i>fucking Girimehkala</i> and have to spend another <i>fucking hour</i> in these <i>fucking hallways</i>… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-capture_008_27042018_193932.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
EMBRACE THE MAJESTY OF SPACE!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hacker.jpg"/> this seems almost unbearably tedious. not just the game part, though that’s pretty bad. just like the entire concept of working with all these screenshots and transcribing all this dialogue<br/>
<br/>
I assume you write code for a living?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Hacker.jpg"/> i fail to see your point<br/>
<br/>
Well, anyway, let’s start gathering the info we need to find the next boss. Here’s the map again, so you don’t have to go searching for it:<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Map.png"/><br/>
<br/>
1:<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> THE SECTION CHIEF SAYS “<b>PRIVATE TALKS ARE PROHIBITED</b>” SO MUCH, IT’S LIKE HIS <b>CATCHPHRASE</b>.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> WAKE UP, GO TO WORK, COME HOME, SLEEP… RINSE AND REPEAT, FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> MY INCOMPETENT BOSS KEEPS MANIPULATING ME. I ALWAYS GET THE WORST OF IT… <br/>
<br/>
He sounds more competent than you, at the very least. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> THE <b>SECTION CHIEF</b> WOULD GET REAL ANGRY IF HE HEARD ME SLAGGING HIM OFF LIKE THIS. <br/>
<br/>
2: <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> HM, IS IT DAY OR NIGHT? I CAN’T TELL ANYMORE…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> IT MUST BE NICE BEING A SECTION CHIEF. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS <b>YELL AT PEOPLE</b>.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> THINGS MAY BE TOUGH, BUT THIS IS ALL FOR THE SAKE OF MY FUTURE…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> THINGS MAY BE TOUGH, BUT THIS IS ALL FOR THE SAKE OF MY FUTURE… YEAH, THAT’S RIGHT. I HAVE TO KEEP BELIEVING THAT.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the first line of the last two are identical. No, I don’t know why.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-2___054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Over at the door to the second area: <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Noir.jpg"/> Yes, it opened! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> We might end up getting a chief director ID eventually if we keep getting higher and higher ranks! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> Agreed. Let’s go about this one step at a time. Oh, and if you’re feeling tired, be sure to stop in at a safe room, Joker. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-2_-_055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
These are Mothman, cryptids from West Virginia of all places. They’re weak to Gun and use Electricity.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-2___057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This is the part where I learn that if I don’t pay attention and mash when Bullet Hail comes up, I don’t get the free damage. Shit. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-2___058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Fire Boost strengthens Ann’s Fire skills by 25% automatically. We slot it in to replace Ambient Aid, which was a garbage skill. <br/>
<br/>
Here’s room 3: <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> I’M USED TO <b>GETTING YELLED AT</b>. I DON’T MIND IT ANYMORE.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> THERE IS NO FUTURE FOR ANY OF US IF THE COMPANY CAN’T TURN A PROFIT! WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PUSH ON WITH ALL OUR EFFORT. THIS IS JUST THE WAY IT IS… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> THE SECTION CHIEF ALWAYS SAYS “<b>THIS IS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD</b>.” IT DRIVES ME MAD...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> HE’S SO COCKY, BUT HE BARELY DOES ANY WORK HIMSELF.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-2___059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> Yup! We’ll need a section chief or higher ID card for this one. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Noir.jpg"/> I’m truly sorry for all the trouble I’m putting you through…<br/>
<br/>
You’re not forgiven!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Panther.jpg"/> Stop that. The only one who’s going to be apologizing here is your father, right? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Fox.jpg"/> Panther is correct. Let us go search for this next ID card. <br/>
<br/>
All right, now to check out the bots. There’s currently no one at B, so there’s three options: A, C, and D.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-2___053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Here’s A.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Skull.jpg"/> There’s one! It looks way different from the others. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Mona.jpg"/> What rank is it though? I wish they’d make them so you could tell just by looking… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Panther.jpg"/> Either way, let’s try starting up a conversation like last time without raising suspicions. <br/>
<br/>
A:<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-ChiefBot.jpg"/> I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOUR FACES BEFORE. WHO MIGHT YOU BE? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Joker.jpg"/> Y’know, the Phantom Thieves./<b>&gt;Just passersby.</b>/We’re employees. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-ChiefBot.jpg"/> YOU’RE PASSING BY IN A PLACE LIKE THIS? IS SUCH A THING EVEN POSSIBLE? HMM… THAT ASIDE, WHAT HAVE YOU COME HERE FOR? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Joker.jpg"/> <b>&gt;The chief director.</b>/We’re looking for Okumura./We want loot. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-ChiefBot.jpg"/> AH, SO YOU’RE ACQUAINTANCES OF THE CHIEF DIRECTOR. SORRY, BUT HE IS OUT AT THE MOMENT… WON’T YOU PLEASE WAIT QUIETLY? <b>PRIVATE TALKS ARE FORBIDDEN</b> WITHIN THIS OFFICE.<br/>
<br/>
C:<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-ChiefBot.jpg"/> HEY! WHO ARE YOU!? YOU CAN’T BE WANDERING AROUND HERE UNATTENDED! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Joker.jpg"/> <b>&gt;Sorry.</b>/No need to get so angry./Shut your trap.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-ChiefBot.jpg"/> ARE YOU TRULY APOLOGETIC THOUGH? I DON’T MEAN TO LECTURE YOU, BUT <b>THIS IS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD</b>! I’M NOT SURE WHAT BUSINESS YOU HAVE HERE, BUT YOU CAN’T JUST COME INTO-- WAIT… JUST WHO ARE YOU ALL ANYWAY? WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Joker.jpg"/> <b>&gt;The chief director.</b>/Okumura./The Treasure.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-ChiefBot.jpg"/> HM? AND WHAT BUSINESS DO YOU CHILDREN HAVE WITH HIM? HE IS A VERY BUSY MAN. I DON’T INTEND ON SPARING TIME TO CHAT WITH THE LIKES OF YOU ONCE I BECOME CHIEF DIRECTOR EITHER. EITHER WAY, SUCH <b>PRIVATE TALKS ARE FORBIDDEN</b> IN THIS OFFICE! IT IS TIME YOU STOP TALKING!<br/>
<br/>
D:<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-ChiefBot.jpg"/> <b>HEY</b>! WHAT IS WITH ALL THIS RUCKUS!? WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU ARE RIGHT NOW!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Joker.jpg"/> <b>&gt;Sorry.</b>/No need to get so angry./Shut your trap.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-ChiefBot.jpg"/> ARE YOU SERIOUSLY APOLOGIZING TO ME? UGH, AND YOU HAVE SUCH STRANGE ATTIRE TOO… NOW THEN, WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR IN HERE? THIS IS NOT SOME SORT OF PLAYGROUND FOR YOU! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Joker.jpg"/> <b>&gt;The chief director.</b>/Okumura./The Treasure.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-ChiefBot.jpg"/> THE CHIEF DIRECTOR, YOU SAY? WHY WOULD PEOPLE LIKE YOU BE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE LIKE HIM!? YOU MAKE NO SENSE WHATSOEVER! I FEEL FOOLISH FOR EVER TAKING YOU SERIOUSLY! <br/>
<br/>
It’s clearly C from the clues here, though the original clue for “PRIVATE TALKS” seems to have been inconsistently translated as “PROHIBITED” instead of “FORBIDDEN.” Let’s just go for that one. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-2___063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
These guys murder me the first time I fight them because I still have Mothman active, whoops. The big dude’s weak to Wind. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-capture_010_27042018_203605.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Also, Ryuji attempts to learn Elec Break, but it’s worthless, especially on him, so we don’t bother. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-2_-_064.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-2___065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Noir.jpg"/> An employee ID! This one says it’s for the section chief… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Skull.jpg"/> Ughhh, so he wasn’t the chief director dude either!? Can we just fight the president already? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-2___066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Intercom.jpg"/> EVERYONE, IT IS TIME TO CHANGE SHIFTS! KEEP WORKING EVEN IF IT DESTROYS YOU! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Panther.jpg"/> This is… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-2_-_067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Mona.jpg"/> Come on, get with the program! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> The employees must be getting switched out just like before. Why don’t we check the places accessible via the section chief ID card? <br/>
<br/>
So, we’re two-thirds done with this thing, right? <i>Wrong.</i> This last portion takes me a <i>full hour</i> to complete. RIP me.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, that hacker got awful quiet all of a sudden. Maybe he left. Yeah, that’s probably it. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-2_-_068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Skull.jpg"/> Oh crap, that thing’s huge! What’s with him!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Noir.jpg"/> If size shows the importance Father places on them, I suppose he should be quite high up… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> We’re just gonna have to talk to him and find out. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-2___070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Tetrakarn is a skill that allows Haru to repel one Physical or Gun attack on a chosen party member. It’s very situational, but it can come in handy.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-2___071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Noir.jpg"/> Great, this one is open as well! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> We’ve gotta be close to the end, right? Chief director is usually directly above section chief! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> Don’t forget to be conscious of your condition, everyone. If you’re feeling tired, be sure to rest at a safe room. <br/>
<br/>
We get it, <i>Mom</i>.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-2_-_072.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Subrecover HP is a rather awkwardly-named skill that lets Futaba heal party members who aren’t in the active party for 10% HP every battle. It’s not actually that useful, both because I almost never switch and because of how late it comes in. Also, multi-target healing out of battle hits everyone, so that’s even less reason to use it. <br/>
<br/>
And at the last door on the map, the chief director lock:<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Map.png"/> <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-2___074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> Hm, another roadblock. Is this one rank authentication as well? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> Mm-hm. We can get through here if we have a chief director ID card or higher. Though given the layout of this floor, it doesn’t look like this leads to a new area or anything. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> So our main goal remains the door we found downstairs. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Skull.jpg"/> Why don’t we skip all this shit and just nab the president’s ID? I wanna get this over with! <br/>
<br/>
BIG MOOD<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-2___075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I also discover that these things don’t just look like Daleks when one of them starts chasing me. <br/>
<br/>
Okay then, let’s get the rest of these done. First the clues, then the conversations.<br/>
<br/>
1:<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> IT’LL ONLY CAUSE TROUBLE FOR EVERYONE IF I COLLAPSE NOW… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> IT-IT-T-IT’LL ONLY CAUSE TROUBLE FOR EVERYONE IF I C-C-C-COLLAPSE NOW… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> I’M HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO WORK FOR THIS COMPANY! GARBAGE LIKE US ARE GRATEFUL FOR OUR WORK AT OKUMURA FOODS!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> THE CHIEF DIRECTOR ALWAYS SAYS THIS COMPANY IS THE <b>BEST OF THE BEST!</b> I AM THANKFUL TO BE ABLE TO WORK FOR SUCH AN ELITE ORGANIZATION!<br/>
<br/>
I’m pretty sure these last two dudes are undercover Pinkertons. <br/>
<br/>
2: <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> BUT I WILL BE OK. THE HEART OF A ROBOT WILL NEVER B-B-B-B-BREAK!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> ISN’T THE SECTION CHIEF’S LAUGH STRANGELY HAPPY? IT GOES “<b>GRAHAHAHA</b>.” NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT, I CAN’T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I ACTUALLY LAUGHED...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> THEY SAY IT’S GOOD TO STRUGGLE THROUGH LIFE WHILE YOU’RE YOUNG… I WON’T BE ABLE TO BECOME A REAL ADULT UNLESS I CAN PUSH THROUGH THIS.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> AHHH, I’M FA-FA-FA-FA… FALLING APART...<br/>
<br/>
3: <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> I’M TIRED OF THE SECTION CHIEF BOASTING ABOUT <b>WHEN HE WAS YOUNG</b>. I BEST HE WOULDN’T SURVIVE IF HE COULDN’T CLING TO HIS <b>PAST</b> GLORIES.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> I WAS TOLD THAT OTHERS HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR ME. I AM BETTER THAN THEM! I HAVE TO WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> I’M IN PAIN, BUT I MUST KEEP WORKING. OTHERWISE MY FAMILY WILL BE TURNED INTO FUEL… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> I SIMPLY HAVE TO DO IT! WORK IS THE ONLY OPTION! <br/>
<br/>
4:<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> LIFE IS ONLY WORK. THEY MAKE YOU SURRENDER YOUR HOPES, DREAMS, PERSONALITY… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> THEN IF YOU WORK TOO HARD, YOU BREAK AND THEY DISCARD YOU. I WISH THIS WASN’T TRUE… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> DON’T WORRY. SOMEBODY WILL SURELY DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS EVENTUALLY. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Whisper.jpg"/> I’LL JUST HAVE TO STAY QUIET UNTIL THAT DAY COMES. <br/>
<br/>
A:<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-DirectorBot.jpg"/> AHEM! WHO MAY YOU BE? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Joker.jpg"/> Y’know, the Phantom Thieves./Just passersby./<b>&gt;We want to talk to you.</b><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-DirectorBot.jpg"/> YOU HAVE BUSINESS WITH ME? BUT TO THE EXTENT OF MY KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS OUR FIRST MEETING. WELL THEN, WHAT DO YOU NEED?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Joker.jpg"/> <b>&gt;What is your rank?</b>/Where’s the chief director?/Nothing in particular.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-DirectorBot.jpg"/> MY RANK? YOU COULD SAY I’M SOMEWHERE IN THE UPPER ECHELONS. WHY DO YOU ASK?<br/>
<br/>
B: <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-DirectorBot.jpg"/> HMPH, WHO ARE YOU!? WHAT ARE TINY BRATS LIKE YOU DOING HERE? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Joker.jpg"/> Don’t be so rude./We’re the Phantom Thieves./<b>&gt;Are we in the way?</b><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-DirectorBot.jpg"/> OF COURSE! WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU ARE!? THIS CORPORATION IS THE <b>BEST OF THE BEST</b>: OKUMURA FOODS! YOU SHOULD NOT BE HERE! MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHO ARE ALL OF YOU!? HOW DID YOU GET IN!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Joker.jpg"/> We snuck in./&gt;<b>Through the front door.</b>/That’s a secret.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-DirectorBot.jpg"/> THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR? SO YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU’RE NOT ANYBODY SUSPICIOUS? YOUR LOOKS WORRY ME… BUT IT WOULD BE A PROBLEM IF I MISTAKENLY REPORTED YOU… <br/>
<br/>
D:<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-DirectorBot.jpg"/> UMMM, WHO’RE YOU AGAIN?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Joker.jpg"/> The Phantom Thieves./Passersby./<b>&gt;We want to talk.</b><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-DirectorBot.jpg"/> I HAVE NO NEED FOR THAT. NOW, GET LOST. YOU’RE JUST IN THE WAY OF MY WORK. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Joker.jpg"/> Please hear us out./Are you the chief director?/<b>&gt;You seem unenthusiastic.</b><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-DirectorBot.jpg"/> GOHOHO! MY ENTHUSIASM IS WHAT MAKES ME WANT TO GET BACK TO MY WORK. MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHO ARE YOU? I SHOULD REPORT EVERY LAST ONE OF YOU FOR SLACKING OFF! <br/>
<br/>
E:<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-DirectorBot.jpg"/> WHO’RE YOU? THIS IS NO PLACE FOR RUNTS LIKE YOURSELVES. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Joker.jpg"/> <b>&gt;Oh, sorry.</b>/Well that’s not nice./I’m no runt. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-DirectorBot.jpg"/> UGH, BRATS THESE DAYS THINK APOLOGIZING CAN GET THEM OUT OF ANYTHING. WHO ARE YOU, ANYWAY? YOU DON’T SEEM LIKE EMPLOYEES. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Joker.jpg"/> We’re the Phantom Thieves./<b>&gt;We’re janitors.</b>/We’re salesmen.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-DirectorBot.jpg"/> JANITORS!? O-OH… WELL, GOOD WORK. I DON’T HAVE TIME TO MEMORIZE JANITOR’S FACES IF OUR COMPANY WILL BE THE <b>BEST OF THE BEST</b>. ...SO, WHAT BUSINESS DO YOU JANITORS HAVE WITH ME? <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-DirectorBot.jpg"/> <b>HWA-HEM</b>! WHO ARE YOU RASCALS? HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea why “HWA-HEM” is in special text. None of the clues relate to it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-DirectorBot.jpg"/> WHAT BUSINESS DO YOU HAVE HERE AT OUR BEST OF THE BEST CORPORATION, OKUMURA FOODS?<br/>
<br/>
And here, “BEST OF THE BEST” isn’t in red text, which I think is <span class="bbc-spoiler">just them trying to trick you.</span> Be consistent, game! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Joker.jpg"/> Are you the chief director?/<b>&gt;Nothing in particular.</b>/Let’s talk for a bit. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-DirectorBot.jpg"/> THEN WHY DID YOU COME HERE? LEAVE AT ONCE! YOUR PRESENCE IS MAKING ME FEEL QUITE ILL!<br/>
<br/>
“YOU’RE IRRITATING MY VALVE, FOUL WORKER!”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-DirectorBot.jpg"/> …iS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO TALK ABOUT BEFORE I KICK YOU OUT!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Joker.jpg"/> <b>&gt;Let’s discuss the past.</b>/Let’s discuss the future./Let’s make some small talk. <br/>

<br/>
So, uh… which one? Some of these seem to refer to the section chief, so we can safely ignore those. The problem is, there isn’t enough information to narrow it down. Well, the answer is that it was a trick question! See, whether by simple mistranslation or just general error, the lines here referring to the “section chief” are not here to trick us, because they do in fact refer to the chief director! Also, if we go back to F:<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Joker.jpg"/> &gt;Are you the chief director?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-DirectorBot.jpg"/> HM? OHHH, I THINK I’VE FIGURED IT OUT. YOU MUST BE THE RUMORED PHANTOM THIEVES! <b>GRAHAHAHA</b>! VERY WELL, I’LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH. I AM INDEED THE CHIEF DIRECTOR! WHETHER YOU CHOOSE TO BELIEVE THAT OR NOT IS UP TO YOU. NOW THEN… IS THAT ALL YOU WANTED TO ASK ME? <br/>
<br/>
There’s more dialogue, which the game fucking encouraged us not to check for earlier by making it punishable with a pointless fight! So, yeah, F is the correct answer. I hate this.<br/>

<br/>
The Corporobo will use Matarunda a fucking lot to lower Attack, so Maaku spends a lot of turns getting rid of that. It’s weak to Psy, though. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Noir.jpg"/> Perfect! We’ve finally found the chief director’s ID card! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Panther.jpg"/> This means we can go in that rank door downstairs now! <br/>
<br/>
I don’t see what the door’s smell has to do with this, Ann.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> Welp, let’s go check it out! Time to make like a banana and split! <br/>
<br/>
Back downstairs...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-2___078.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Oracle.jpg"/> Of course! Well… probably.<br/>
<br/>
Don’t you fucking start<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-2_-_079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Skull.jpg"/> Hell yeah! Finally! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Queen.jpg"/> You know, it’s a little odd… I thought Okumura might be behind the mental shutdowns… But we haven’t found anything even remotely pointing to such a secret so far. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Mona.jpg"/> Something that important might be deeper in. Let’s just keep going. <br/>
<br/>
And that, my friends, was the security card game, the worst part of the entirety of Persona 5 in my esteemed opinion. That took up an hour and forty-five minutes of this run alone, though to be fair I was intentionally running all over the entire place looking for dialogue and I died like three times. Well, at least the worst is behi--<br/>
