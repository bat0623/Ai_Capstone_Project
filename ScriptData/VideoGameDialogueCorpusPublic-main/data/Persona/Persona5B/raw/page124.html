<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kawakami.png"/> I saw a lot of errors on the previous test, so please be more careful in the future. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kawakami.png"/> Today’s examples will be on your entrance exam, so make sure you know them. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Girl_5.jpg"/> She usually looks so tired… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Boy_13.jpg"/> I talked to her this morning about my future… and she was super polite. Friendly, even. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Boy_11.jpg"/> Yeah, I know what you mean. She even gave me advice about my girlfriend. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Protag.png"/> <i>Now that she’s back on her feet, Kawakami seems to be working hard as a teacher...</i><br/>
<br/>
Kawakami’s rested and reinvigorated. Good for her. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Hiruta.png"/> Stealing hearts? Social reform? Don’t give me this Phantom Thieves nonsense. It’s all so unscientific. I mean, how could they target Big Bang Burger and Okumura Foods? They’re criminals! That artificially consummate flavor… Enough volume to fill a small universe.<br/>
<br/>
I see Mr. Hiruta went to the Code Talker school of burger appreciation.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Hiruta.png"/> Are the Phantom Thieves trying to steal the galaxy called junk food from me!? That said… Hamiru-kun. The night sky may be filled with countless galaxies… but in the entire universe, which of these is closest to its density of stars. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Imagining three watermelons in the sun is giving me a right chuckle, I tell you what.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Hiruta.png"/> Hehe. I expected as much out of you. Yes. The correct answer is three watermelons in the sun. Three bees in the whole of Europe works too. In other words, the universe is essentially empty. There are countless stars in the sky, but the universe is even more vast than that. Even within our galaxy, the stars are separated by a great distance even though you can see so many. <br/>
<br/>
How bleak. Maaku gains <b>Knowledge +1</b>. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Hiruta.png"/> Close, but yet far… Hehe, you could say the same of our hearts. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> Ugh, if he only knew the places we’ve been… <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shinya.png"/> Sounds like they had another success, huh? That’s cool.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shinya.png"/> It’s probably because they think I’m weak. If only I was as strong as the Phantom Thieves… <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Takekuma.jpg"/> Hah, my bad. I didn’t mean it like that. I just thought we should be friends, since we’re both gamers. The name’s Takekuma. I make a living from gaming, more or less. Ever heard of me? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-020.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shinya.png"/> ...Yeah, you’re the guy from all those videos online! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Takekuma.jpg"/> And you’re the one they call the King, right? I’ve always wanted to play you… But I don’t know if it’s a good idea… I mean, if I beat you, your rank will definitely drop. And I don’t need people bashing me for beating a kid. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-023.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Takekuma.jpg"/> As I expected of the King… OK, let’s get this started. <br/>

Christ, look at Takekuma. What is that hand supposed to be, a scouter? What a fuckin’ dork. <br/>
<br/>
Also, shout out to this lady, reading her phone over someone else’s shoulder:<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Clipboard760.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shinya.png"/> How…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Man_5.jpg"/> The King is getting destroyed… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Office_Worker.jpg"/> That’s Takekuma, isn’t it? He’s awesome! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shinya.png"/> I missed!? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shinya.png"/> ...Th-That doesn’t count! Let’s play again!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Takekuma.jpg"/> You got it. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Office_Worker.jpg"/> The King got slaughtered! Ha! That’s hilarious! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shinya.png"/> One more… One more game! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Takekuma.jpg"/> No matter how many times we play, the end result will be the same. We should probably stop, for your sake. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shinya.png"/> Shut up! You cheated, didn’t you!? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Cheer on the child throwing a tantrum! This is a good idea!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Takekuma.jpg"/> Man… I guess the King is just a little kid after all… Looks like I overestimated your ability. I’d feel bad beating you again, so I’m going to go. Make sure you practice for the next time we play. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shinya.png"/> You’ve gotta be kidding me… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Maybe encouraging him in this situation isn’t the greatest plan, but I feel kinda bad. He’s just a kid.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shinya.png"/> I’m the one who’s gonna win in the end! If I lose, it’s all over for me! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shinya.png"/> I’m gonna beat him next time for sure. This isn’t over. The strongest always win in the end. Just like the Phantom Thieves… Watch, I’ll win for sure next time! I’m not a loser, you’ll see! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Protag.png"/> <i>Shinya is more motivated than ever before...</i><br/>
<br/>
That’s not necessarily a good thing. I may be grooming a young Eric Cartman in the making. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shinya.png"/> ...Crap, it’s late. I gotta go… Man, that Takekuma though! Telling me to practice for next time… A grown-up shouldn’t spend so much time playing video games!<br/>
<br/>
I feel personally attacked.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Protag.png"/> <i>Interacting with Shinya has made my heart grow… I feel like my <b>Kindness</b> has increased…</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Ohya.png"/> Well, I guess it is pretty obvious. *sigh* Pulling all these consecutive all-nighters is really wearing me down. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> At this rate, you’re going to work yourself to death. You’ve been meeting your quota, right? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Ohya.png"/> The chief really wants me to mess up, but I’m not going to give him the satisfaction. Haha… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> He’s like some kinda tyrant. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Ohya.png"/> Tell me about it. It’s a race to see whether I can find Kayo before he crushes me… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> That’s not good! Shouldn’t you do something about the chief before you keep chasing Kayo-chan’s case? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Ohya.png"/> There’s nothing I can do about a guy like that. He’s rotten to the core. And despite how he acts, the higher-ups like him. I have no one to go to. It’s over. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> Yeah, he didn’t seem like the kind of guy to change his mind… But at this rate, you won’t be able to continue your investigation… What do you think, kid? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-049.jpg"/><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Protag.png"/> <i>I need to do something about the chief and help her...</i><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Ohya.png"/> Ughhh, I’m gonna die… <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Ohya.png"/> I wonder where Kayo is… Sorry, but I don’t feel like getting any info from you today…<br/>
<br/>
Uhh, with your quota as it is, can you really afford not to ask me anything? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Ohya.png"/> Thanks for coming all the way out here though. I’ll see you around… <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Eiko.jpg"/> It’s nothing real major, but I need it like, right now… I’ll pay you back though, honest! Pleeease! <br/>
<br/>
Makoto and Maaku turn to each other, then look back at Eiko.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Makoto.png"/> ...Does this have to do with Tsukasa? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Eiko.jpg"/> Mm-hm… He dropped a super expensive bottle of sake at work, so the club’s making him pay for it… but he needs help. <br/>
<br/>
Oldest trick in the book. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Makoto.png"/> ...He’s lying to you, Eiko. Don’t give him any money. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Eiko.jpg"/> He’s not lying! I know you’re all weird about the fact that he’s a host, but my Tsukasa’s not like that! He’s really gentle, and honest too… He even calls me “princess”! I’m the only one he says that to, y’know. He says it’s ‘cause I’m special. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Makoto.png"/> So he calls you his special princess… What do you think, Maaku-kun? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-060.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Makoto.png"/> Every girl who gives him money is his “princess.” That way he can never get their names mixed up. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Eiko.jpg"/> Don’t accuse him of that stuff! You don’t have any proof! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Makoto.png"/> ...You’re not wrong about that. But did you ask anyone at his club about the broken bottle? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Eiko.jpg"/> W-Well, um… no… He told me not to talk to them about it though! He’s too proud to have me go crying to his boss.<br/>
<br/>
Man, this girl’s dumb.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Eiko.jpg"/> ...Please, Makoto. You’re the only person I can trust. All my other friends would rather focus on cram school and entrance exams than take time to help me… And who knows what my parents’d say if I tried to ask them… Please. Even a little… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Makoto.png"/> ...I think you should end your relationship with him. If you don’t put a stop to this, he might try to drag you into some suspicious line of work.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Eiko.jpg"/> Oh, he already got me a job. It’s nothing weird though. I’m just serving drinks at a bar to help him pay off that broken bottle. He said I’ll be number one in no time. Maybe I’ll just keep doing it after I graduate high school though. I mean, it’s not like I’m gonna go to college.<br/>
<br/>
Man, this girl’s duuuuuuuuumb.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Makoto.png"/> You can’t just do what he says! He’s trying to deceive you…! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Eiko.jpg"/> ...A smart person like you totally wouldn’t understand what it’s like. You’re just gonna go to a good college, work at a fancy company, and then what? At the end of the day, your life’s gonna be totally boring. I mean, is that seriously how you wanna live? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Makoto.png"/> I… I’m not sure yet. But be that as it may, you should still stay as far away from him as you can. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Eiko.jpg"/> ...So you’re not gonna help me? Ugh, just forget it. I can make it up if I just let some customers take me out on dates after work.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus christ!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Makoto.png"/> Eiko, wait! I didn’t want to have to tell you this, but Tsukasa has been texting me almost constantly. Recently, he’s been asking if my sister and I live alone, and that he’d be glad to help us out. Even today he asked me if I’m still happy with my boyfriend… Listen to me, Eiko: He’s not serious about you. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Eiko.jpg"/> Don’t gimme that crap! Tsukasa’s just so nice that he’d worry about my friends for me… Wait, you were texting him behind my back? What the hell, Makoto!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Makoto.png"/> It was mostly him texting me… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Eiko.jpg"/> Ugh! You have the grades, the looks, a cool boyfriend… and you seriously still want more!?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the compliment! I think you’re swell too!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Eiko.jpg"/> Tsukasa is all I have…! You can’t take him from me! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Eiko.jpg"/> Yeah right. Just keep your hands off! I’d never forgive him if you stole him away, Makoto…! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Makoto.png"/> You know, I think she’s exactly the kind of girl those gangs in Shinjuku are on the lookout for. Lonely, depressed girls who have nowhere to vent their frustrations… <br/>
<br/>
What is it with this city and its sea of predators lying in wait to victimize women, monetarily or otherwise?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Makoto.png"/> Eiko’s family is quite well off. Her multi-talented younger brother seems to be the sole focus of her parents’ attention though. I’m sure that’s why she fell for Tsukasa in the first place. He treats her like she’s special. But… asking a high schooler for money isn’t normal boyfriend behavior. She needs to realize that. You’re going to help, right? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-065.jpg"/><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Makoto.png"/> Eiko’s blessed to have both money and a family… yet she’s still trying to break free from them. She’s almost the exact opposite of me. ...But I guess in a sense, watching her now is almost like looking back at my past self. I was so blinded by my own convictions that I never stopped to consider other alternative viewpoints on the world. But… that’s not the right way to live. I want to show her that, just like you did for me. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Protag.png"/> <i>I can sense a deep bond of trust from Makoto...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Makoto.png"/> I know she wants me to stay out of her business, but I’d never forgive myself if I let this come to pass. …… What is the right way to live…? ...At any rate, we’re going to catch that horrible host. I’ll let you know once I’ve thought of how to do it. Thank you again for today. I’ll see you later. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-076.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Chihaya.png"/> I’ve been trying to use this as an opportunity to investigate into the ADP’s seminars so I can expose him… But the deeper I dig, the scarier everything becomes. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-077.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Chihaya.png"/> The ADP apparently doesn’t profit at all from sales of the Holy Stones. It’s nothing more than a front.<br/>
<br/>
Wait, so not only is this organization somehow not managing to profit off of selling hunks of rock salt for 100k a piece, it’s only a <i>side business?</i> Why in the hell are they so insistent about her selling more of these giant pieces of nothing if they don’t tangibly benefit from it in any way? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Chihaya.png"/> Most of their revenue actually comes from the seminars.<br/>
<br/>
Self-help’s a lucrative business, man. Why work to improve yourself when you can have someone talk at you until you feel like you’re doing something to improve yourself?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Chihaya.png"/> There, they give their patrons some sort of mind-altering drug…<br/>
<br/>
That took a turn! Holy shit!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Chihaya.png"/> After which, they’re encouraged to donate their life’s savings to the “benefit of the ADP.” People have gone missing after seminars… Families have been torn apart by this madness… <br/>
<br/>
This is like an unholy amalgamation of five or six different conspiracy theories about cults, many of which have little factual basis but are just kind of fun to think about in a scary way, so they endure. I actually took a class recently on the subject of cults and new religions in general, and while I think the teacher may have been a bit too even-handed on the subject when most of us really just wanted to hear about the gnarly shit like the sick fucks we are, I learned a lot. Brainwashing’s not really a thing, for one, and brainwashing facilitated by mind-altering chemicals is just hilarious nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
I’m pretty sure Scientology is still a scam, though, I don’t care what she said. Speaking of scams, back to Chihaya’s Kooky Kult! (Khihaya? No, that doesn’t work)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Chihaya.png"/> And I… I was a part of it all. By selling these fraudulent stones, I was in direct support of their horrible actions.<br/>
<br/>
In what way? It’s still unclear. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Chihaya.png"/> I know this doesn’t make up for what I’ve done… but I want to help the others come to their senses. Barely anyone within the ADP will talk to me though, and those who do won’t actually hear me out. What should I do, Hamiru-san…? These people are all heading down a path toward great ruin… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-078.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Chihaya.png"/> Right. I’ll just have to admit to everything that’s been going on, even if I get dragged down too… That’s… the only way… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Protag.png"/> <i>It looks like Chihaya’s not sure how to approach this issue… She might do something rash at this rate… I should take care of the chairman before that happens…</i><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Chihaya.png"/> I’m the only one who can stop him… right? <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-079.jpg"/><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="130-RyujiBlue.png"/> First off, one of them sexy characters’d never come to the gym in their PE uniform. <br/>
<br/>
This failed seduction is one of the best character beats in the entire game, and makes me like both characters way more. It’s a shame the animated cutscene leadtime led to Ryuji just being Horny All The Time in those because it’s way more interesting to see him like this, rejecting her attempts to play him because he knows her too well. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="163-AnnChat.png"/> How are things with you, Haru? Has anything happened with the media?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="164-FutabaChat.jpg"/> I hope they haven’t been horrible to you. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="162-HaruChat.jpg"/> Thank you. They will surely say a great deal about my father, but I am determined to push through it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="165-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Society doesn’t care what may be going on as long as it is enough to kill their perpetual boredom. They don’t even consider how their words may hurt others.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="166-RyujiChat.png"/> They think caring about people is someone else’s job. It makes me wanna puke. <br/>
<br/>
Man, the people we’re doing this all for sure are shitheads!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="162-HaruChat.jpg"/> There’s nothing we can do about that though. And… everything they say about Father is true.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="167-MakotoChat.jpg"/> But it’s important to remember there was someone else in the shadows behind the shutdowns. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="168-128.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="166-RyujiChat.png"/> Yeah. It’s gonna be a hella good victory when we expose that criminal for who he really is. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="167-MakotoChat.jpg"/> We’ll have plenty of time to ask him about it then. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="169-MorganaAngry.png"/> The one behind the mental shutdowns… It has to be someone dangerous. Now that we’re getting closer to the truth, we need to be ready for absolutely anything. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="170-129.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-TV.jpg"/> The popularity of phantom thieves is as strong as ever. More people are becoming fans every day. Some, however, might be going too far with comments like, “I want them to destroy all evildoers.”<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> I’m glad that we have fans, but not if they’re genuine fanatics. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="173-Hifumi.png"/> And so… Oh, do you have some time? ...I’m feeling a bit anxious. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="174-132.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="173-Hifumi.png"/> Thank you… ...After I confessed, I was scorned by the media. I bet everyone wants me to lose. However, I’m not going to give them the satisfaction. I’m going to win… with these very hands. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="175-133.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="176-134.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="173-Hifumi.png"/> I will! Well, it’s time. I have to go to the venue. You won’t be able to go inside the match room, but you can watch over the internet, if you’d like. Well then, I’m off. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The men at the table in the background, a journalist and his editor, discuss the match. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="179-Editor.jpg"/> She’s getting pushed back quite a bit. It’s only a matter of time now… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Protag.png"/> <i>Hifumi is biting her lip. She doesn’t seem to be doing so well...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="180-137.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
There’s a large commotion throughout the room. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="181-Office_Worker_2.jpg"/> Perhaps her skills ARE of genuine article? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="179-Editor.jpg"/> Oh, no, that’s not good. The next move will surely result in checkmate. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Protag.png"/> <i>Hifumi looks troubled as she’s being pushed around the board… She hasn’t made a move…</i><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="181-Office_Worker_2.jpg"/> I’m thinking “Phony Princess, Real Defeat” as the headline for our next article. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="182-138.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="183-139.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="173-Hifumi.png"/> It was as if an ant had challenged an elephant. A shogi player should know her limits. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="184-140.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="173-Hifumi.png"/> I was so ashamed of myself. I didn’t want to hurt the pieces any longer… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="185-141.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="186-142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="173-Hifumi.png"/> One must lose with grace… With dignity until the very end, as a queen should… But I confess I am confused… I mean, naturally I am disappointed that I lost… ...But I still feel happy… as if a demon has been purged from me. The moment I realized that victory was impossible… I felt a strange peace. What’s important is what I do from this point on… I played so disgracefully in front of you… Perhaps you can just view it as an example of what not to do… ...And understand that there are times which require one to forfeit with valor and grace. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Protag.png"/> <i>I feel Hifumi’s trust in me…</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="187-143.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Touryou lets us instantly escape any normal battle. We already had the ability from an earlier skill of Hifumi’s to escape from ambushes instantly, but this extends that to everything. It’s useful even if you’ll pretty much never run from a fight, especially at this late stage of the game. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="173-Hifumi.png"/> Um, I’ve been thinking about this for a while… Let’s make today your last lesson… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="188-144.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
What?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="173-Hifumi.png"/> Spending time with me has only brought you pain… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Protag.png"/> <i>Hifumi is thinking hard...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="189-145.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This message appears when we arrive at a crucial dialogue option. I’m sure you all know what I mean by “crucial”: girlfriend time. During each Rank 9 Confidant event with a romanceable Confidant, we may get this popup, meaning we have to pick the right option or set of options to start dating that girl. We didn’t see it with Kawakami last update because I decided not to even entertain that option and picked a choice that bypassed the process entirely. Also, yes, Kawakami was dateable, fuck me. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="173-Hifumi.png"/> ...So this is goodbye. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="190-146.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...Shame we won’t be picking her romance option. Part of me wishes Hifumi had actually won, but it seems it was not to be.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="173-Hifumi.png"/> The things you say sometimes… Perhaps I should take a lesson from that ambitious nature of yours… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="191-147.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="173-Hifumi.png"/> There may be things I can learn from you as well. I suppose this is a friendly rivalry for both of us… as irreplaceable shogi friends. Well then, let’s go home…
