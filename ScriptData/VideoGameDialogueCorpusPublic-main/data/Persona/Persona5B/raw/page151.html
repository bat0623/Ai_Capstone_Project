<br/>
Due to our forced egress from the Palace, we sadly no longer have Money Reading. What a shame. Oh well, let’s continue!<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The area shimmers, revealing the courtroom, then shimmers back.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-RyujiSkull.png"/> Dude… If this stuff’s still surprisin’ you, you’re gonna be in for a world of hurt from here on. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> Hahaha… It still is a little hard to believe, I must admit. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-YusukeFox.png"/> Look, there is a counter up ahead. Shall we head there first? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> I suppose there would be no issue in stopping by. Let us go. <br/>
<br/>
Yep, let’s head to the counter.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Casino_Shadow.jpg"/> First off, we would like to extend a welcome gift to you. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-capture_443_08082018_111727.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Another 1000 coins. Not much to brag about, but oh well.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-FutabaOracle.png"/> Just 1,000 though. At least give each person that much, cheapskate.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Casino_Shadow.jpg"/> I’m sorry, but the welcome gift can only be applied once per card. Furthermore… this is the map for the high limit floor. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-MakotoQueen.png"/> OK, show us your prizes now. We want to exchange our coins for a member’s card. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Casino_Shadow.jpg"/> *chuckle* We do have prizes, but that is unfortunately not one of them. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-MakotoQueen.png"/> What? Then how are we supposed to get to the manager’s floor…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Casino_Shadow.jpg"/> I assure you, there is no need for a card. Please head over there… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> Well, we cannot proceed unless we check it out. Why don’t we head over there for the time being? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-010.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Well, what do we have here? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-012.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-AnnPanther.png"/> There’s an area over on the other side too. That could lead to the <b>manager’s floor</b>!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> There can be no doubt… We’ll need to <b>lower the bridge</b> to cross. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-HaruNoir.png"/> But how do we do that? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> Hm, how indeed. Let us try investigating around here.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
First things first, there’s a locked chest over here. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
God, we have so many Lockpicks.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Another Bead Chain, nifty. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I wonder if the thing we need to examine is the device right next to where the last cutscene ended? Hmm… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Intercom.jpg"/> The required number of coins to activate the Bridge of Judgment is <b>100,000 coins</b>. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-HaruNoir.png"/> What…? We need <b>100,000 coins</b> just to cross over there!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-MorganaAngry.png"/> It’s getting clearer that she has no intention of letting us proceed onward. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> I don’t believe there is any need for pessimism though. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-AnnPanther.png"/> But think about how much that is! We were desperate just to get our hands on 50,000… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> But we still obtained them in the end. We can succeed if we do that again, then double our total. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-MakotoQueen.png"/> I suppose this is the high limit floor… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-YusukeFox.png"/> Indeed, there must be a high risk, high return game somewhere here. Though we’ll need to win too… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> Our first order of business should be to see what kind of games exist on this floor. <br/>
<br/>
First, though, let’s head back to the counter. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-122.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
There are three items available for purchase here, none of which are terribly necessary. The “best” one is the one that doesn’t require us to swap out an SP Adhesive 3, so not one of the accessories. That would be the Golden Beam, a weapon for Akechi that fires bullets that inflict Despair. The other items are a Tyche Charm, which increases the user’s luck by 10 (!). If I had any faith that Futaba’s Luck stat did anything, I would buy this immediately. And the Despair Charm just nulls Despair. Not useless, but not worth much either. I don’t buy anything here just yet, but if you do decide to make a purchase, keep in mind that even with all the coins we have up to now available on the previous floor or this current one, there aren’t enough to buy all three. I might have missed a package on the previous floor, or needed to do some bonus gambling there, but if you buy all three items right now, you won’t have enough coins for the buy-in for the games ahead. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Now, let’s start by heading over to the House of Darkness. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-022.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-RyujiSkull.png"/> You better not be lookn’ for a fight. We ain’t interested! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Casino_Shadow_2.jpg"/> *chuckle* That won’t be necessary. You are valuable participants, after all. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Casino_Shadow_2.jpg"/> Most certainly. The original intent behind the high limit floor is different from that of others. On this floor, VIPs are encouraged the send substitutes to compete in the games in their place. Consider it to be like the horses in horse racing. However… it seems you have no substitutes. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-MakotoQueen.png"/> Of course we don’t. That should be obvious. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Casino_Shadow_2.jpg"/> Indeed it is! Hence, you will be the vital participants in these games. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-MorganaAngry.png"/> ...So we basically need to be our own substitutes. Eh, sounds perfect to me! That’s way better than spectating!<br/>
<br/>
Speak for yourself, Morgana. You’re on the bench anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Casino_Shadow_2.jpg"/> Splendid! Now, allow me to explain the rules. A straightforward maze lies directly ahead of you. I suggest you exercise utmost caution within, as the lighting is dimmed quite heavily. Your entry fee into this maze will be <b>1,000</b> coins… But if you can manage to reach the goal, well… you will obtain <b>ten times</b> that amount. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> It is no wonder they call this the high limit floor. I doubt the maze will be as simple as it sounds… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Casino_Shadow_2.jpg"/> One more thing: You are free to head backward in the maze or even leave the room if you so choose. ...Well then, please enjoy. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Aww, you’re just paranoid! Sounds like fun!<br/>
<br/>
<b>Music:</b> <a href="https://clyp.it/0qxietv4?token=c6c7298ff9813dd69108cb2bf08971bc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Disquiet</a><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Aww, beans.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-RyujiSkull.png"/> God damn! It’s so freakin’ dark! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-MakotoQueen.png"/> This is definitely not “a little.” We’ve been tricked.<br/>
<br/>
He didn’t say “a little,” though. He said “quite heavily.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-FutabaOracle.png"/> I’m sensing Shadows too. “Very simple,” my ass. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-YusukeFox.png"/> If we do not ascertain the layout and placement of the enemies, we will surely find ourselves in danger. I just hope there is an adequate way of doing so… <br/>
<br/>
Wink wink.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
In case you don’t immediately realize what you need to do, just tape down your L1 button for the rest of this segment, because it’s Third Eye time, baby! Using it will actually make it brighter for once. From there, it’s rather simple to detect the Shadows and find a way forward. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This is Norn. It can heal itself to full and use Wind and Electricity. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And these are Rangda, a staple of the SMT series. They reflect Physical and Gun, but are weak to Electric and Bless damage. They use Curse and Physical.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Eventually we follow the straight path until we come to a room with a bunch of NPCs huddled together. That’s odd. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And we see the reason why. The only door forward won’t open.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-AnnPanther.png"/> No way… It’s not opening!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-YusukeFox.png"/> Impossible. We took the only path available straight to this point. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> So, the participants are trapped in here to fall victim to the Shadows? ...It seems they have no intention of letting us proceed further. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-RyujiSkull.png"/> Dammit, this is cheatin’… Actually, it’s even worse than cheatin’! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-MakotoQueen.png"/> Regardless, let’s search for a way past here. We can’t get the coins if we don’t reach the goal. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, there’s an open vent conveniently placed <i>right next to it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-MakotoQueen.png"/> Hm, how convenient. If they’re not going to let us move forward, we can force our way through here. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> Haha, an unsurprising idea for Sae-san’s sister. I will go along with whatever plan we choose. The decision is yours, Joker. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We find ourselves high up in a new area upon exiting the vent. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This is Skadi. She uses Ice attacks, and can use the combo of Evil Smile and Ghastly Wail to inflict Fear, then kill anyone with the status. No weaknesses, but reflects Ice.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the rest of this area is a long, tedious trek through identical dark corridors, with maybe a treasure chest if you go the wrong way. I’m not going to bother showing them all off, so let’s just skip to the end.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-AnnPanther.png"/> Is that it though? It feels like there’s more up ahead. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And another treasure chest. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-040.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The Morose Collar is a decent piece of armor for Morgana with Resist Brainwash.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Next, we enter this outrageously long hall. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-043.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
What? You’re gonna have to speak up! You’re really far away!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-MorganaAngry.png"/> Huh? That’s the guy who was at the reception desk… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-045.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Really, man? Why’s everything gotta be a goddamn trial around here? ...Shut up, I know this is a courthouse, that pun was <i>not</i> intentional.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-RyujiSkull.png"/> That bastard! What’s he tryin’ to do here!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-MakotoQueen.png"/> Leave your complaining for later. Our path’s been blocked, so we need to find a way around. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-capture_444_08082018_144739.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We could just grab the edge and hop over this, you guys. It’s not that tall. *sigh* Welp, time to wander through more backrooms.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Morgana learns Garudyne to replace Garula. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Haru also learns Psiodyne to replace Psio.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
They’re really backloading these treasure chests, damn.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-050.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh sweet, another Soma! That makes three in our inventory, two of which we got from this dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-RyujiSkull.png"/> Man, that long way ‘round shit is bull! Where’s that bastard from earlier, huh!? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We might as well reset the cards, even if we won’t actually be coming back this way. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-AnnPanther.png"/> Hey, isn’t this the thing that Shadow was messing with? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-FutabaOracle.png"/> Oh, we have an escape route now! We can proceed onward without having to worry about it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Now that we’re past that, we’ve trapped the Shadow in a dead end. Let’s finally finish this.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Casino_Shadow_2.jpg"/> You truly are pests… Every time you think you’ve crushed them, they just come crawling back in. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-RyujiSkull.png"/> What was that, you bastard!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-MorganaAngry.png"/> I hope you’re ready. We didn’t appreciate that trap of yours.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-AnnPanther.png"/> He’s right! You didn’t have any intention of letting us get past that maze in the first place! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Casino_Shadow_2.jpg"/> Ah, you are indeed correct! That is how things are supposed to be. You’re not worthy of victory. Now, won’t you just lie down and die for me? This isn’t an easy job, you know. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Casino_Shadow_2.jpg"/> Awww, is that so? Well then it seems I have no other choice…!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-058.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This guy uses Electric attacks, and will eventually use Concentrate to boost them. It’s got more health than most of the other minibosses in this Palace, but this guy’s still kinda pathetic. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ryuji learns Megaton Raid, a Severe Physical strike that finally puts him on par with Yusuke and Akechi in terms of Physical damage strength. It replaces Assault Dive. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yusuke also learns Bufudyne to replace Bufula.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-MakotoQueen.png"/> Considering how things were on the members floor, it’s no surprise this isn’t a fair game either. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> And yet we still reached our goal. Come now, let us go. We have no more business here. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-YusukeFox.png"/> Hm, we will have to go to another game if we want to win more coins… <br/>
<br/>
We’re then given the option to warp directly back to reception, which we take. But before we explore the other wing of the high limit floor, let’s take a little diversion...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Music:</b> <a href="https://clyp.it/vqwgcmqp?token=066612d6fe19121f880850863e3f59cd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Aria of the Soul</a><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Justine.png"/> The names of the Personas you have registered now fill more than half of the Inmate Registry. Our master is pleased with your rehabilitation and has yet again bestowed a special privilege. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Caroline.png"/> We’re giving you a bigger discount on summoning from the registry! What do you think? Are you happy? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Justine.png"/> If you fill the Inmate Registry with even more names, our master may grant further privileges. Work hard toward your rehabilitation. <br/>
<br/>
The summoning discount has now increased from 10% to 15%.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Today, we’re fusing Horus from Norn and Girimehkala. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Horus.jpg"/> I’ll be your mask from now on! Let’s fly together into the light! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Horus is an Egyptian god associated with the sun, and is the son of the god Osiris. The pharaoh of Egypt was thought to be the personification of Horus, and was responsible for keeping balance. In his battle with his brother Seth, the gods chose him as the victor. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Next, Seth as an Advanced Fusion from Thoth, Isis, Anubis, and Horus.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Seth.jpg"/> So you wish for the power to kill, even if others abhor you? In that case, I shall become your mask.<br/>
<br/>
Kill? What? No.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Seth is the Egyptian god associated with deserts, storms, and chaos. He was married to his sister, which I guess ran in the family because Osiris, Horus’ father (and Seth’s brother) who he ended up murdering, did the same thing. He and his nephew Horus have a never-ending battle, with the upper hand shifting as it turns from day to night and vice versa. <br/>
<br/>
Now, we’ve fused the Seth we need for the last Strength request. However, it doesn’t have the skill we need, High Counter. Oops. We could go through all the trouble of re-fusing it by leveling Dakini to 52, then fusing it with Pazuzu to make a new Horus with High Counter...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-071.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-072.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-073.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Or we could just do this.<br/>
<br/>
We got this skill card from a request, upon which I mentioned we should save it for later. Well, now's later. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Caroline.png"/> You really made it…!? <br/>
<br/>
Err, yes. I totally fused it and didn’t cheat at all, yep.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Caroline.png"/> The inmate with all those pitiful Personas actually managed this…? H-Hmph. I guess I can compliment you this time. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Justine.png"/> Well done. You have far exceeded our original expectations. This may not be a proper thing to say to an inmate, but you have done extraordinary work. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Caroline.png"/> You’re a real handful, but I gotta give you some credit. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Justine.png"/> As for the next task we will assign to you… There is nothing. You have fulfilled every duty available to you. As the ones who rule over power, our role is… ……<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Justine.png"/> I-It is nothing. Just… my head… Urgh! These memories… The one who first wrote this list. It was me… Or was it us…? Just… what are we…? <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Justine.png"/> *pant* *pant* My apologies…<br/>

<br/>
Caroline and Justine turn to each other and nod.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Caroline.png"/> But… fine. I’ll grant you that privilege. Heg, we’ve really gone soft, huh?<br/>
<br/>
You still kick me into the Velvet Room. How soft can you possibly have gone? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Justine.png"/> Perhaps… Perhaps you are too embarrassed to admit how much his concern pleased you? <br/>
<br/>

And, um, Inmate… There’s no doubt you’re a problem child. But honestly… we’re real impressed that you conquered all the trials we put forth.<br/>
<br/>
Aww, shucks.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Justine.png"/> You hold a surprisingly great potential. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Caroline.png"/> So… fight. I’m sure you’ll be able to accomplish anything you put your mind to. <br/>

Now, we can head to the Battle Arena. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="111-093.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-094.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Casino_Shadow_2.jpg"/> Oh, it’s you guys… Our manager told us about you. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="113-095.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Casino_Shadow_2.jpg"/> My, you’re so quick to anger. Wonderful. This would be quite boring if that wasn’t the case.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-HaruNoir.png"/> Oh! Yes, we do!<br/>
<br/>
We do <i>what,</i> Haru? Did <i>anyone</i> read over this script before it went out?<br/>
<br/>
(What I <i>think</i> happened here is that he’s supposed to ask if we have 10,000 coins to participate in the Battle Arena, but because we came here second that line isn’t playing correctly and got skipped over. I dunno, weird)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Casino_Shadow_2.jpg"/> Oh, you have surely been busy. Very well then, allow me to explain this game to you. Here, you will prove your supremacy in a trio of fierce one-on-one battles. Then again… this is the pinnacle of our casino, the high limit floor. Normallu, our VIPs would prepare substitutes who would fight to the death for their sake… The attending guests then bet coins on who they think will win. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="114-096.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> The entirety of this floor must be like that. Taking little risk for a high return is truly the optimal business strategy. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-HaruNoir.png"/> But can we even participate if we don’t have a substitute? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-Morgana.png"/> Hey, we didn’t need one for the other game! The same probably applies in here too. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Casino_Shadow_2.jpg"/> As irritating as it may be, that is correct. Please participate. Registration will take place at the counter over there. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-097.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-AnnPanther.png"/> Of course! Our teamwork’s gonna take down this arena of yours! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Casino_Shadow.jpg"/> Ah, now that won’t do. This is a series of honest one-on-one battles. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="117-098.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Casino_Shadow.jpg"/> Correct, only one can participate. You’ll need to choose someone to act as your representative. The entry fee for this event is <b>10,000</b> coins. However, if you manage to succeed the trials, you will be granted ten times that: <b>100,000</b> coins. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="118-099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> Hm… This feels like a trap to me. An amount that high would certainly ensure great danger. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-MakotoQueen.png"/> But failure to infiltrate this Palace will be the end of us. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-RyujiSkull.png"/> So we don’t got a choice… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> Very well. In that case, Joker should be the one to participate. We don’t know what kind of enemies may appear, so his high level of adaptability will be vital here. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> I’m glad you understand. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-FutabaOracle.png"/> I think I can at least provide backup from the sidelines. You won’t be alone, Joker! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Casino_Shadow.jpg"/> Has your mind been made up? The battles will begin once you enter. Now then, shall you challenge the imposing Battle Arena? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-101.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Casino_Shadow.jpg"/> Oh…? In that case, please head onward into the ring. The entry fee and appropriate prize total shall be calculated at the <b>end of the game</b>. Now then… prepare to know the true meaning of agony. *chuckle*<br/>

<br/>
Remember this number kids, it’s going to be on the exam.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="128-Chatter.jpg"/> Wow, the Phantom Thieves are surprisingly popular! It’s rare to see odds in the double digits! Now, let us begin our serious one-on-one battle! Bring out the first contestant! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="129-109.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-AnnPanther.png"/> This isn’t one-on-one at all! They’re just ignoring the rules right from the beginning! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="128-Chatter.jpg"/> Now then, it’s time for this hellish trio of battles to begin! Ready, set… go! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="130-114.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This first group won’t do much besides Cleave and occasionally just not act. They can Charge up, increase their Attack and decrease your Defense, but it’s rare and I only saw it when I was down to one. It’s still annoying having to deal with two of them, though. If only we had a Persona with both multitarget damage, Resist Physical, and a full heal spell...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="131-115.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh, wait. They go down real simple after we switch to good ol’ Hungry Monk.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="132-110.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="128-Chatter.jpg"/> You know, that’s a little hard to say… I’m just going to call him the Phantom Dweeb from now on! All of you betting on the house, do not fret. The second round of contestants is arriving now!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="133-111.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-HaruNoir.png"/> How cowardly! There’s nothing fair or honest about this! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="128-Chatter.jpg"/> Quiet down in the peanut gallery. Now, it’s time to die in this bloodcurdling battle!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="134-112.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="135-113.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oops, I killed them all in one hit. You know, I was kind of dreading the Arena, but a good Persona can carry you through it no problem as long as you’ve got Diarahan at least once somewhere in your arsenal. The multi-target and Resist Physical’s just cake.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="136-116.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="128-Chatter.jpg"/> Grr, there’s no way in hell you’re getting away with this! Time for our final contestant! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="137-117.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-FutabaOracle.png"/> Yowza… That’s a big one.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="128-Chatter.jpg"/> Go, grind his bones to dust! Let the extreme third battle begin! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="138-118.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Charge, wait, Megaton Raid, Concentrate, wait, Ziodyne, repeat. That’s his entire pattern. As long as we guard the Ziodyne because we don’t resist it, we’re fine. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> Yes, I expected that would be the case. Our other trials have been rigged as well, after all. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-MakotoQueen.png"/> So you sent Joker in knowing full well the possible dangers!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> I simply had faith in his skill. And to be honest… there was no other course of action available. Come now, we should head to the bridge. This shall be our moment to shine. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="142-121.jpg"/><br/>

Lookit all them coins, hot damn. Let’s head back to the authentication device, then. <br/>

(I bought some of the accessories before heading over, if you’re wondering why the coin count is different)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Intercom.jpg"/> The required number of coins to activate the Bridge of Judgment is <b>100,000 coins</b>. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-RyujiSkull.png"/> We got that! Now let us through! <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-FutabaOracle.png"/> That’s not fair! You can’t give us an impossible task like that! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="146-SaeShadow.png"/> Ah, you finally understand? That is the point. Your task will forever be impossible! Hence, I will emerge victorious! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-HaruNoir.png"/> We had only just barely gotten 100,000 coins as well… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> She said she would let us through if we had 1,000,000 coins, yes? In that case, there won’t be a problem. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="146-SaeShadow.png"/> What…? How could that be!? <br/>
<br/>
Stole the words right outta my mouth.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> Do you remember what we were told at the very beginning? Essentially, we could borrow as many coins from the casino as we already held on our card. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-HaruNoir.png"/> Well yes, but… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> For example, had we borrowed the max when we had 10,000 coins, we would have ended up with 20,000. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="151-130.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It took me fucking forever to figure out where on earth he got the number 460,000 from. As it turns out, if you remember the odds from the Battle Arena, they were 23.0 for the Phantom Thieves. This was in a single throwaway line of dialogue from a disembodied voice who didn’t get a portrait or voice acting, and you almost certainly forgot about it thus.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-MakotoQueen.png"/> Yes, but you’re speaking purely in hypotheticals. That’s not what actually happened. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> Correct, on Joker’s card. However, that is not the only card in our possession. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="146-SaeShadow.png"/> You have… another card!? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="152-131.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> Exactly. Instead of disposing of it, I secretly used it to gather coins and outsmart this system.<br/>
<br/>
He did it in the magical kingdom of Offscreen Land, where nothing takes any time whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="153-132.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="146-SaeShadow.png"/> H-Hmph… So what? That’s still clearly not close to the required total.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="154-133.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="155-134.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
What the fuck is going on<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="156-135.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Um, what? This isn’t order of operations, subtraction doesn’t come after multiplication. You would have needed to pay the first sum back first before you doubled it. That’s only 900,000. It doesn’t actually change anything, but still.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> Adding Joker’s total to that brings us to 1,010,000 coins. We can surely cross the bridge now. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="157-136.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> Is there a problem? The manager’s room lies ahead. We won’t need to worry about coins after this. Or did you honestly intend on paying back such a large sum? <br/>
<br/>
I owe like a million coins to a casino in this lady’s heart. Afraid somebody’s gonna come bust my kneecaps.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="146-SaeShadow.png"/> Impossible… This can’t be…! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="158-MorganaShocked.png"/> Crow… It’s a actualy a little frightening how sharp you are…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> I’ll take that as a compliment. I’m glad I was able to contribute to our Phantom Thieves efforts. Now, we should hurry and let the bridge down before she decides to change the rules once again.<br/>
<br/>
Why <i>doesn’t</i> she?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I feel like I should explain just what the hell Akechi’s plan actually was because literally all of it takes place offscreen. <br/>
<ol class="bbc-list" type="1">
<li>Register the Taro Tanaka card on the high limit floor for a free 1,000 coins.<br/>
</li><li>Register for the maze, taking him from 1,000 coins to 0. <br/>
</li><li>Complete the maze, giving him 10,000 coins. <br/>
</li><li>Borrow 10,000 coins, giving him 20,000 coins.<br/>
</li><li>Bet on Maaku in the Battle Arena with 23-to-1 odds, giving him 460,000 coins. <br/>
</li><li>Return 10,000 coins and borrow another 460,000. I guess these actions take place simultaneously because he should have 900,000 by any stretch of the imagination, not 910,000.<br/>
</li><li>Somehow pool the points on both cards to reach a number he didn’t know he needed. <br/>
</li><li>Seriously, it relies on him just assuming we’ll need not just more coins, but exactly one million. It makes no sense anyway.<br/>
</li></ol>
That extra 10,000 coins that appeared out of nowhere is great, though, because it means you can go back and buy the last item from the counter if you’re so inclined. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-MorganaAngry.png"/> A lot has happened, but we managed to get up here! Miss Manager’s days are numbered! <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="146-SaeShadow.png"/> I entertained you with all of my “games,” but it appears you are still far from satisfied. Very well. I’ve made preparations especially for that possibility. This will be a game of life and death from now on. No matter who I face, I shall not lose! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-MakotoQueen.png"/> Sis… …… Our infiltration route is secure. We need to head back out and send the calling card. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> And once the calling card is sent, Sae-san’s Treasure will appear, correct? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-MorganaAngry.png"/> Yeah. Once the target is cognizant of the danger, that cloudy thing will take shape. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> I wonder… What will the Treasure look like? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-AnnPanther.png"/> That depends on the person… For Kamoshida, it was a medal. Madarame’s was a painting, and Kaneshiro’s was fake money… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-HaruNoir.png"/> Father’s was a plastic model… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> In other words… the Treasure is what marked the beginning of the Palace ruler’s aspirations. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-YusukeFox.png"/> It could also be what caused their desires to swell. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-MorganaAngry.png"/> Thinking about it won’t get us anywhere though. Let’s head back and prepare the calling card. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-FutabaOracle.png"/> Hm? What’s up? You curious about the Treasure?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-HaruNoir.png"/> Speaking of that, it actually looks like there’s a shape formed in the haziness… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-MakotoQueen.png"/> If I had to guess… I’d say Sis’ Treasure is a police notebook.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> Right… Your father was…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-MakotoQueen.png"/> She…. Probably thinks Dad died because the police were using him. That’s why she believes justice is meaningless, and that there’s no point living a subservient life… Dad’s death is even the reason she aspired to become a prosecutor and grew so obsessed with winning… She really loved him… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-GoroCrow.png"/> Sae-san’s heart must be exhausted from living in such a fiercely competitive world… Honest beliefs alone are not enough to get you through. Even I understand that pain… But that is exactly why we need to change her heart.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-MakotoQueen.png"/> ...Yes, you’re right. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-YusukeFox.png"/> And now we’ve ascertained the location of the Treasure for that goal. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="172-Nav.png"/> Now returning to the real world from Niijima’s Palace. Thank you for your hard work. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="173-150.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="174-MorganaHappy.png"/> We finally secured our route to the Treasure! All we need to do now is send the calling card. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-RyujiSkull.png"/> Mkay, I’ve been waitin’ for this! Anyways, when’re we gonna send it? I guess that part’s up to you, dude. Let us know when you need us! <br/>
<br/>
Welp, finally out of there. That was the best Palace and it still was… a lot. But enough of that, time for the final edition of the Phashion Phrenzy!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="175-Butler_and_Maid.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
More weird maid uniforms, yep. Exactly what I wanted out of this, game. At least Maaku has a cool monocle. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="176-Christmas.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I like most of these, honestly. Yusuke’s and Ann’s are kinda lame, but Ryuji’s is dope, Haru’s got a cute hat, and Makoto’s outfit here rules hard enough that I felt compelled to show off the cape. Also, Morgana, you need arms, you silly!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This is the “final boss” music of Persona 4: Dancing All Night.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="177-Dancewear.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I’m glad they didn’t go with any of these outfits in the real Persona 5 dancing game, because most of them are traaaaaaaash! Akechi’s is the only one I actually really like.<br/>

<br/>
This is the Tokyo battle music in Shin Megami Tensei IV.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="178-Samurai.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
These outfits are all near-identical, but I like Morgana’s Burroughs outfit. Also the look really works for Haru for some reason.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I’m actually not sure where this plays in Persona 4 Arena Ultimax. I think it’s the title screen music.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="179-Shadow_Operatives.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh shit! We look like the slickest nazis! I like the custom glasses/masks for everyone but this is just a comically bad look all around, hah. The Shadow Operatives are about this lame though, so I get it. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This is the battle music, surprisingly hard to find, for Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. The Soulless Army.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="180-Student.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We’re not exactly fashion-forward here, but the Yumizuki High School uniforms have a certain charm. Also Akechi is dressed as an imperialist dog, and Morgana is Gouto! How adorable! We don’t need him getting any more sarcastic, though. <br/>
<br/>
Now, it’s time to decide a winner… and compiling the data here, my objective choice is… Akechi? Goddammit, what? This machine is broken! Ugh. Whatever. You idiots can just decide amongst yourselves. No, there isn’t a reward. Life is pointless, get used to it. <br/>
<br/>
I can’t believe I spent 60 dollars on this horseshit.
