<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaTankTop.png"/> Ooh, a uniform! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaTankTop.png"/> You look great. Surprisingly. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Sojiro.png"/> Futaba says she’s going to shift to living a morning person’s life. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaTankTop.png"/> A healthy mission starts with a healthy lifestyle. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Sojiro.png"/> Mission?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-TV.jpg"/> In regard to the so-called “Phantom Thieves” events that have been a hot topic among the general public… The prime minister held a press conference at his official residence to address the problem. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chatter.jpg"/> The government acknowledges the current rumors of the group called the Phantom Thieves. We are currently confirming facts with the police and wish to deal with it in an appropriate-- <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Sojiro.png"/> Even the prime minister’s talking about the Phantom Thieves? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaTankTop.png"/> They’re allies of justice, after all. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Sojiro.png"/> They change hearts, huh…? I wonder if it’s true. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Morgana.png"/> Looks like we’re finally being recognized across the country. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Morgana.png"/> In all honesty, I think you guys are managing great. It’s all thanks to my amazing guidance. Let’s find clues on that case as soon as we can too, and resolve it ourselves. ...For Futaba’s sake too. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Sojiro.png"/> ...You two really get along, don’t you? You’re gonna be late if you don’t get going soon. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaTankTop.png"/> Good luck on your student duties. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-TV.jpg"/> We’ve even received messages about how the Phantom Thieves are all students talk about these days. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-007.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chatter.jpg"/> I thought it was just an ordinary website… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Murmur.jpg"/> Lately they’ve added a polling feature to ask who you’d like to see have a change of heart.<br/>
<br/>
Goddammit, Mishima. Was that your big new idea? I can’t see this going wrong, no sir.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Murmur.jpg"/> Given people’s heightened expectations, it’s been receiving a lot of votes. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chatter.jpg"/> Huh… Maybe I should go vote for our company president. “Change his heart so he’ll raise our salaries!” Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Boy_5.jpg"/> Not like I did anything during summer break. I gust stayed in and played online games. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Boy_2.jpg"/> Nothing you could’ve done this summer would’ve topped the Phantom Thieves! Hacking Medjed back and all the other stuff—it was totally nuts! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Boy_5.jpg"/> Everyone online was waiting for the deadline to hit. People sure do love the Phantom Thieves. Speaking of, have you checked out the Phan-Site recently? They added a bunch of new stuff, including the option to rank people to get a change of heart. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-AnnSummer.png"/> It’s like, it always ends right when you get used to a life without school. ...Then again, I guess we had some fun things this year. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Kawakami clears her throat loudly. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Kawakami.png"/> All right, let’s begin homeroom. Let’s see. We’ve just gotten back from vacation, but starting next Monday is the school trip. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-AnnSummer.png"/> Oh yeah, that’s right. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Hawaii!? That seems like kind of a big deal. You’d think someone would have brought that up at some point in the last half year. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Kawakami.png"/> Make sure that none of you cut loose too much, OK? <br/>
<br/>
The students become rowdy.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Kawakami.png"/> OK, settle down! That concludes homeroom. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-015.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Girl_1.jpg"/> You can speak English, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-AnnSummer.png"/> Basically, yeah. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Girl_2.jpg"/> That’s amazing!<br/>
<br/>
I forgot how shitty my portraits for some of these generic students were, yikes. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-AnnSummer.png"/> I lived over there, so it’s nothing that special. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Girl_1.jpg"/> Hey, if there’s something we’re not sure of in English, can we ask you about it? <br/>
<br/>
Theeeeere we go. Everybody wants something. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-AnnSummer.png"/> Huh!?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-018.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Despite both of our phones clearly going off, this conversation does not appear to include Ann. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-RyujiChat.png"/> Is it the same for you? Talk about being popular. Anyways, now that a new semester’s started, let’s have another operation meeting.<br/>
<br/>
Shouldn’t you text the others about this and not just me?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Maaku and Ann look at each other. I suppose Maaku is psychically transmitting that information to her.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chatter.jpg"/> Rankings, huh? Sounds interesting! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Murmur.jpg"/> All you do is vote? Isn’t that kind of pointless? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Chatter.jpg"/> You never know. They might be looking at it. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Whisper.jpg"/> I’m sure the Phantom Thieves will steal their heart! <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-AnnSummer.png"/> Futaba! Did you come here by yourself? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-YusukeBlue.png"/> I went to get her since I got out of school early. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaTankTop.png"/> What a patronizing Inari. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-RyujiSummer.png"/> Well then, let’s get talkin’. Whadda we do now? Should we go after another big target? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-YusukeBlue.png"/> That’s important too, but what about that villain in the cognitive world? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-MakotoSummer.png"/> It’s almost certain that this person exists. What’s more, they’re inducing mental shutdowns… We certainly can’t turn a blind eye. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-RyujiSummer.png"/> Yeah, but we don’t got any clues… But! You know how we’re totes popular right now? Everyone at school’s talkin’ about us, and not a day goes by when you don’t hear about it on TV either! We totally made it big, don’tcha think? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-AnnSummer.png"/> True. The rankings on the Phantom Aficionado website have been crazy too. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-RyujiSummer.png"/> Huh? What the hell!? First place… keeps changing by the second! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaTankTop.png"/> People are voting around the clock, after all. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-RyujiSummer.png"/> If we go after these guys, I’m sure we’ll score some big cash at least once!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yep. Totally. Cash, the most important thing in this enterprise of ours. Can’t think of any other reason we got into this. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-RyujiSummer.png"/> What would you use money like that for, Maaku?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-RyujiSummer.png"/> I’ve never heard of a phantom thief that saves up money! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-MakotoSummer.png"/> Are you fine with that, Futaba? Even though it’s related to what happened to your mother? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaTankTop.png"/> It’s not OK! I’m definitely gonna punch that guy…! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-RyujiSummer.png"/> The culprit forcing mental shutdowns… If you think about it, there’s no bigger target than that. If we can change his heart and get a confession outta him, we’ll be on top of the world for real. Should we reveal our identities then? I bet chicks are gonna be all over us! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-AnnSummer.png"/> Whoa, whoa, you want us to show our faces…!? ...I guess that might be OK? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-YusukeBlue.png"/> I see. If the true culprit confesses, the existence of the Metaverse will become known… There would be no need for us to remain in hiding in such a questionable manner… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Morgana.png"/> Being “unknown” is the allure of being a phantom thief. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-RyujiSummer.png"/> But considering the hype now, it’s gonna be one hell of a huge deal if we pull it off! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Morgana.png"/> Are there really no clues regarding those mental shutdown cases? If I remember right, wasn’t the older Niijima sister investigating it?<br/>
<br/>
Wait a minute. We, the player know that Makoto’s sister was the prosecutor who came to Leblanc threatening Sojiro, but we didn’t know that was tied to the mental shutdowns, did we? Furthermore, how on earth does Morgana know that they’re the same person? Makoto’s been rather quiet whenever it’s been brought up, and as far as I can recall barely talks about her. How does anyone know any of this? The only explanation I can see is that Kaneshiro’s Shadow mentioned Sae’s first name, and then Akechi mentioned Sae in passing the other day, but that’s a rather large leap in the characters’ understanding, especially for a game that feels the need to explain eeeeeeeverything.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-MakotoSummer.png"/> Yes… I can pry and ask about it. But she’ll just tell me to mind my own business and get angry with me.<br/>
<br/>
She’ll probably do that anyway, Makoto. You’ve got nothing to lose!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaTankTop.png"/> If you can’t ask her, wanna just extract that data? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaTankTop.png"/> Does she have a personal laptop or something? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-MakotoSummer.png"/> Don’t tell me… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaTankTop.png"/> Just stick this baby in, and it’ll clone the internal hard drive! It’ll even bypass the OS password!<br/>
<br/>
Why did you think you would need that when you came here today?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaTankTop.png"/> You’ll have to plug it directly into her laptop though. Can you do it? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-MakotoSummer.png"/> Sis does bring her laptop home sometimes… But I’m not comfortable going that far… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-RyujiSummer.png"/> Ooh, is Futaba gonna do something amazin’ again? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-YusukeBlue.png"/> Are you scared of seeing how your sister truly feels? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-MakotoSummer.png"/> No! ...Of course not. ...Fine, I’ll do it. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Makoto takes the device.<br/>

Holy shit, I just noticed this dude’s ear! What the fuck is wrong with it, it’s so small!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Principal.png"/> But I gave a gag order in regard to Mr. Kamoshida’s case… P-Please wait! Please give me some time! I will find evidence on the Phantom Thieves for sure! I couldn’t have made it this far, had it not been for your assistance, sir… so… Please… Please let me-- <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Sojiro.png"/> Still another six months ahead of you. Keep yourself in check, got it?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Yes, if you look away for even a single moment, the order changes completely.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-AnnChat.png"/> It’s hard to decide who to actually go after!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-RyujiChat.png"/> They’re flooding in! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-FutabaChat.jpg"/> We can choose anyone we want!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-YusukeChat.jpg"/> We should wait for now though, it will surely cool off soon. More importantly, how are things on your end, Makoto? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Sis isn’t home yet. She may not come back at all tonight.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-RyujiChat.png"/> Man, just think how great it’d be to narrow down our targets! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Even you, Maaku…? ...I suppose I’ll do it. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Morgana.png"/> Let’s leave this to Makoto. I’m sure she’ll be able to pull it off. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh, you’re thirsty for something, all right. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-TV.jpg"/> Many celebrities have started posting public apologies on their personal blogs and other outlets. The general opinion is that the reason why they are doing this is the Phantom Thieves. The rationale is that they will be spared by the Phantom Thieves if they apologize preemptively. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Morgana.png"/> Some people are just confessing what they’ve done wrong on their own? They must be scared of us. <br/>

Heading over to the second-hand shop, the owner has something new for us. Let’s buy this broken laptop. Now, we don’t have any means to repair it as of yet, so we’ll have to save that for another time. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We skipped two (well, more than two) summer hangouts that would have unlocked some new spots, so we buy the top two books for the purpose of unlocking them later. <br/>

Remember waaaaaaay back when I mentioned we wouldn’t be able to rank up Sojiro for a while? Well, Rank 5 of his Confidant is only accessible after 8/22, or after Futaba first joins. We hit Rank 4 something like two or three in-game months ago, so it’s been a long time.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Sojiro.png"/> Thanks. Futaba’s coming to eat today too. I’ll get the curry ready. I’m leaving the coffee to you. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Sojiro.png"/> How was the curry, Futaba? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaTankTop.png"/> Delicious! I’m gonna be dreaming of that stuff tonight!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Sojiro.png"/> Um… did it taste the same as you remember it? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaTankTop.png"/> Yup. I feel like a dummy for not wanting to eat it back when I was depressed about my mom… ...Oh yeah! The first episode of this brand-new anime I wanna watch is airing tonight! I’m outta here! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Sojiro.png"/> Eyes in front when you walk, OK? No spacing out. You ran head first into a pole last time you went for a walk… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaTankTop.png"/> Well you stubbed your toe on the dresser the other day! Aw crap! It’s gonna start! <i>(to Maaku)</i> Making like a leaf, and—Eh, screw it. Bye! <br/>
<br/>
I don’t think that’s how that expression goes, but whatever.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Sojiro.png"/> And what about you?<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Sojiro.png"/> Now then… there’s something I should probably tell you. Here, take a seat. I’ll pour you some coffee. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Sojiro.png"/> You might’ve realized it by now, but that genius was Futaba’s mother… Wakaba. In other words, that curry is one of the last remaining connections Futaba has to her mom. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Sojiro.png"/> I first met Wakaba back when I was doing work for the government. She was real trouble, let me tell you. Logic prevailed over emotion for her, and she had an intricate knowledge of the human mind. I thought my pick-up lines were the best in town, but not a single one worked on her… Heh… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-050.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Sojiro.png"/> It was almost impossible to keep up with her. Men are idiots though… We spend our time chasing after things we can’t get. Wakaba rejected me time and time again… but there was one instance I managed to surprise her. And that was when I gave her a plate of my homemade curry. The very next day she came asking all about the ingredients and what goes into the cooking process… Then just a few days later, she handed me a scientifically-enhanced version of my recipe. ...It was incredible. She had used my curry as the basis, but it was miles better than anything I made. Curry was Wakaba’s specialty from then on. Naturally, Futaba grew to love it in no time as well. But then after Wakaba’s accident… Futaba stopped eating it entirely. The flavor would make her remember the pain… I’ve heard even smells can bring back memories too. But… that curry was the only point of connection I had with Futaba. That’s why when I took her in, I vowed to keep this recipe alive until she could eat it again. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Sojiro.png"/> The whole idea of pairing the curry with a nice brew is thanks to Wakaba’s refinement too. Despite how introverted she seemed, she was extraordinarily perceptive of the people around her… I never even told her about my love of coffee. She figured it out just from looking at me… That was when I realized she was totally out of my league. Not like I really stood a chance to begin with though. She already had Futaba by then, after all. This might seem like any old curry to most people, but there’re tons of emotions crammed inside. So, uh… make sure you keep the tradition going. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-GoroSummer.png"/> That’s nice of you to say. Especially lately since it seems I’m hated by those who support the Phantom Thieves… Anyhow, it seems your school’s in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Oh? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-GoroSummer.png"/> The media is reporting that the whole school was involved in the cover-up about that gym teacher. Those unfortunate students were made victims all because adults valued their own conveniences… This is unforgivable, no matter the reason. ...Let me know if you need anything. I’ll do my best so that the case is wrapped up quickly. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Murmur.jpg"/> The principal claimed he didn’t know what was going on, at first. We’re talking about children’s lives—people like him are the ones who should answer for this. <br/>

She didn’t even have a name, Ryuji. We’ll never see her again. <br/>

Okay, so this scene is obviously here because they realized, “Oh shit, we accidentally implicated Kawakami in the Kamoshida mess,” which they bring up and then… do nothing with. It’s actually kind of more damning than if they’d just ignored it because her failure to give any kind of explanation or alibi here means it’s not at all irrational to assume that she did know something, whoops!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Kawakami.png"/> Even if the police ask you anything, you better not make irresponsible comments to them! Seriously, why does this keep happening? All my relatives are gonna call me again…<br/>
<br/>
Chastising children for gossip and worrying about its affect on your personal life is totally the appropriate response to finding out many of your coworkers were involved in a plot to protect a child abuser and implied rapist! I’m just going to pretend this scene doesn’t exist because despite her Confidant being hilariously inappropriate I actually like Kawakami as a character. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-MakotoSummer.png"/> ...Yes, I’ve been told so. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Kawakami.png"/> Now, this came up at the faculty meeting, but the plan is to have third-years to act as our proxies. I’m so sorry to drop this on you, Niijima-san, but we’ll be counting on you. <br/>

We eventually get one… twelve attempts later. That’s actually probably on the low end, considering some of my other tries at this, so 6,000 yen is a low price to pay. We get four more Decked Decarabia (uncommon), one Kinky Kin-Ki (rare), two Gear Girimehkala (uncommon), two Die-soujou (common), and two Mini Dominion (common) before getting a Mossy Mothman (super rare).<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Um, I thought I was trading for a figurine, not a fucking piece! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Protag.png"/> &gt;Let’s trade.<br/>
<br/>
Eh, sure. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="170-Man_5.jpg"/> Thank you, thank you so much! This is so awesome! It’s so fluffy…! Ah, sorry about that. Here’s your <b>Model Gun</b>, just like I promised. If you get another Mothman again, please bring it to me! <br/>
<br/>
Now, considering the amount of effort we just put in for a rather low-grade gun, this may not seem worth it. However, this is one of the best (and only) ways to get Model Guns in the game, which are used for weapon transmutation. If you fuse the correct (endgame, naturally) Persona into one of these, you’ll get a monstrously powerful upgrade to the relevant character. This is just the most blatant example, but Makoto’s ultimate gun gives her +10 in all stats, it’s crazy. Sadly, we can only get five Model Guns from this gentleman before he starts offering something else, but it’s still great.<br/>

<br/>
Now that we’ve given him what he wants, he’ll also start trading for the other figurines we’ve got, in descending order of rarity. Some of these trades are far better than others. Kin-Ki gives us Revivadrin and Life Ointment, which we can just buy, so not that great.<br/>

This is the good one. For Girimehkala he’ll give us Strawberry Curry and Mystery Stew. Strawberry Curry restores 100 HP while lowering defense and our accuracy/evasion rate, which is… bad. Mystery Stew, on the other hand, reduces all three parameters… but restores 30% SP. Considering Dekunda exists, costs 10 SP, and can eliminate those debuffs in a single turn, this is an <i>amazing</i> item, even if it can only be used in battle. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
For Decarabia he’ll give Muscle Drink (30% HP restore, Attack up, Defense down) and Odd Morsel (30% HP restore, Attack up, Hit/Evasion down).<br/>

<br/>
In the trade for Daisoujou he’ll give us a Fulfiller (cures Hunger, weirdly missing from the wiki list of items) and a Coolifier Pad (cures Burn, we already have like twenty).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Finally, for the dreaded Mini Dominion, he gives us a Dr. Salt NEO, just because we went to the trouble of bringing it. It restores 20 HP. Fart.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Akihabara also has a few other points of interest that we didn’t see today, like a games shop, an arcade, and a <i>maid cafe</i> (that we’ll never visit because we’re already maxed on Charm), but… we’re also getting dangerously close to the character limit, so we’ll have to continue this in the next post!
