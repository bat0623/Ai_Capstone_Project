<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Sojiro.png"/> Yo, welcome back. You get tanned a bit? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-FutabaTankTop.png"/> How was Hawaii? <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-FutabaTankTop.png"/> *gasp* He’s been influenced… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Sojiro.png"/> Eh, I can understand why. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Morgana.png"/> While you guys were off having fun, things here have gotten a bit more problematic.<br/>
<br/>
In the in-game text this line is written as “were guys,” though it’s at least voiced properly. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chatter.jpg"/> Here is a graph of the profits for stores handling these items. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-TV.jpg"/> Double from last year!? Phantom Thief goods seem to be in especially high demand. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-FutabaTankTop.png"/> I didn’t know they sold that kind of stuff. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Sojiro.png"/> Should we try too? I mean, selling Phantom Thief merchandise. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Sojiro.png"/> Maybe I’ll toss some dry ice on the side. Y’know, give it that phantom-y effect… Uh, I’m just joking, all right? <br/>
<br/>
<i>(television)</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chatter.jpg"/> I wonder how our guests consider this recent phenomenon. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-TV.jpg"/> What do you think, Akechi-kun? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Goro.png"/> Well…<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-FutabaTankTop.png"/> There he is, the anti-Thief detective. I hope he slips up and self-destructs. <br/>
<br/>
<i>(television)</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Goro.png"/> I can sense some chivalry behind their actions. They are clever to take the silent resentments of the public into account and relieve them. I believe that may be the secret to their popularity. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-TV.jpg"/> Well this is surprising. Your stance seems to have softened.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Goro.png"/> This doesn’t change the fact that they are dangerous. However… No, I shouldn’t say any more…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-TV.jpg"/> Come on, you can say it. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Goro.png"/> Oh no, I won’t be falling for that. I’ve learned my lesson after the previous backfire… <br/>
<br/>
<i>(not television)</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Sojiro.png"/> These thieves are more popular than the police or politicians. What’s the world coming to? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-FutabaTankTop.png"/> Rude! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Sojiro.png"/> What’re you so angry about? Hey, I’m gonna go to the bathroom. Take care of any customers that show up. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Murmur.jpg"/> A Phantom Thieves stamp. Isn’t it awesome? <br/>
<br/>
Not really, no. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Murmur.jpg"/> Who do you think the Phantom Thieves will target next? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chatter.jpg"/> I wonder… I’m really excited to find out! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Murmur.jpg"/> I don’t care who it is—just do it already. <br/>

Yeah, all that nothing I did in Hawaii really drained me. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-TV.jpg"/> With Phantom Thieves inspired movies and TV shows in the works, this craze is still gaining momentum. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah. That sounds like a fantastic idea. I’m actually pitching a story of my own about a guy who plays Fortnite while dabbing with fidget spinners, because all trends are forever.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-TV.jpg"/> With the economy in a slump, some think that this may help give it the boost it needs. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-MorganaAngry.png"/> People are really making money off of us? Where’s our cut? <br/>

We need to feed our plant. Apropos of nothing, I’m a very smart person who didn’t have to spend a half-hour replaying a week of in-game cutscenes because I forgot to feed this plant today, no sir!<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-MakotoSummer.png"/> I have souvenirs for you. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sae.png"/> ...The principal of Shujin Academy has passed away. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Welp, fuck. I know we saw that cutscene, but there’s official confirmation.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Kobayakawa-2.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
Still, man, mad respect for somehow leveraging your position as a fucking high school principal to get in good with a massive political murder conspiracy. Or, wait, is that how you got that job? It’s really confusing and I’m not sure why they needed you there in the first place. If anything, I’m surprised you made it even this far without them realizing you were totally useless to their plans and killing you months ago.<br/>
<br/>
Also, this is only tangentially related, but I find it kind of apt: the site I downloaded my portrait images from didn’t even spell Kobayakawa’s name right. We’ll miss you… uh… (searches for a reference I haven’t used yet) ...Morgan Cortez from Catherine!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sae.png"/> He suddenly stopped while crossing the road and was struck by a large vehicle. Death by external trauma. <br/>
<br/>
Isn’t all trauma technically external? I mean, I know about hemorrhaging, but that’s usually caused by some kind of independent force, right? What would “internal trauma” even be in the first place, because I’m picturing like, blood shooting out of people’s veins with the pressure of a firehose now. <br/>
<br/>
(Looks it up)<br/>
<br/>
It’s referring to shit like damaging your vocal cords? Laaaaaame. And not really that “lethal,” which makes me wonder why you bothered to specify. Unless “internal trauma” means like, “organ damage” and not “my body is attacking me, jesus fuck”?<br/>
<br/>
Also most of the Google results for “internal trauma” just give back results to a Steam game. Whatever. Thanks for indulging my idiocy, everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sae.png"/> They say suicide seems to be a strong possibility…<br/>
<br/>
What were we talking about? Oh yeah, suicide. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-MakotoSummer.png"/> Principal Kobayakawa committed suicide…!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sae.png"/> But would someone about to kill themselves try to go to the police station? He even used a taxi to get there. <br/>
<br/>
Uh-oh, Sae’s Adachi-ing.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-MakotoSummer.png"/> Do you mean… this might be another incident? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sae.png"/> Even if he had a sudden shift in his state of mind… it’s still unnatural. I can only suspect that he had a “change of heart.”<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-MakotoSummer.png"/> Are you saying he was targeted by the Phantom Thieves!? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sae.png"/> How are you so certain? <br/>
<br/>
Come on, Makoto. I thought you were smarter than this. You’re not usually the type to shove your own foot all the way down your throat.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-MakotoSummer.png"/> W-Well… In prior cases, the changes of heart seemed to be done to make people confess their crimes. It’s hard to explain, but this incident seems contradictory to their usual modus operandi…<br/>
<br/>
Back off, girl! This can only go poorly! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sae.png"/> Did Principal Kobayakawa seem any different to you lately?<br/>
<br/>
Sae, thankfully, decides to inexplicably drop it. She’s not usually the type to let shit like that go, as Makoto should know all too well by now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-MakotoSummer.png"/> I don’t really know. He rarely contacted the students, after all… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sae.png"/> I see… Could something have happened during the school trip…?<br/>
<br/>
No. Nothing happened during the school trip, for anyone, anywhere. It was a gaping void of time.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sae.png"/> Ah, you’re studying. I’m sorry to bother you. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Sae pauses for a moment.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sae.png"/> Makoto.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-MakotoSummer.png"/> Hm? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sae.png"/> ...Never mind. It’s nothing. Just don’t get dragged into trouble, OK? <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-RyujiSummer.png"/> Still sluggish, huh? Well, I can say the same for myself… Never midn that, though. Did you know about this? The Phantom Thieves are popular now! I was surprised when we got back to Japan. People’re actually payin’ attention to who we’re gonna target next. Ain’t that amazin’? I’m gettin’ really psyched. This is where we work hard! Let’s do something big again and surprise the world! <br/>
<br/>
Ryuji, Makoto surely contacted you by now, right? You know the fucking principal died, don’t you? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chatter.jpg"/> There’s another urgent assembly… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Whisper.jpg"/> Is it true he died? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Chatter.jpg"/> He was really taking some heat… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Murmur.jpg"/> What’s happening to this school!? Are we cursed? <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Vice_Principal.jpg"/> As many of you may already know… Principal Kobayakawa passed away yesterday. <br/>
<br/>
The crowd begins to talk amongst itself.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Girl_1.jpg"/> I wonder if that suicide rumor’s for real… It happened in front of the police station, didn’t it? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Girl_2.jpg"/> I think I was passing through there at the time… <br/>
<br/>
I know the feeling. I was in Syracuse, New York like, two weeks before 9/11.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Vice_Principal.jpg"/> The principal had been working hard to restore peace ever since the incident with Mr. Kamoshida. He only wished for everyone to be able to lead a normal school life, and because of that love… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Boy_12.jpg"/> Love? Bullshit. He was covering something up. Everyone’s been talking about it. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Girl_7.jpg"/> Maybe it wasn’t suicide… Do you think the Phantom Thieves took him down!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Boy_5.jpg"/> The Phantom Thieves? Do they kill people? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Boy_12.jpg"/> I mean, Kamoshida did say he was gonna kill himself to make up for everything he did. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Girl_7.jpg"/> That would be amazing! Either way, it serves that principal right! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-RyujiSummer.png"/> <i>(whispering)</i> Hell no. We didn’t do jack shit. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-AnnSummer.png"/> <i>(whispering)</i> Are people gonna blame us for this too…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Vice_Principal.jpg"/> I would like to see everyone live up to our late principal’s wishes as proud Shujin students, and… <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sae.png"/> No matter how I think about it, that would’ve been impossible unless Makoto was helping you… But… she would never do something so foolish… <br/>
<br/>
I dunno. I’m starting to suspect Makoto isn’t actually that smart and she just seems more intelligent because she hangs out with us. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I’m kind of getting fed up with Maaku’s shit. He completely sold Makoto down the river offscreen. What the fuck, dude? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sae.png"/> And is it true that you were completely uninvolved with the Kobayakawa case? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sae.png"/> What does this mean…? …… But I suppose targeting someone at Shujin again and actually taking their life would be nonsensical. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sae.png"/> I have no reason to believe everything you’ve said. ...However, it seems you aren’t the type of person who would lie just to protect themselves. I will acknowledge what I must. It’s more efficient that way. <br/>

And if you looked into his Palace, you should’ve seen the answer to those suspicions. Tell me. What did the Phantom Thieves do to Okumura? What did you learn from him? Why did it turn out as it did? I need you to tell me everything. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-AnnSummer.png"/> People are already talking about it online. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-RyujiSummer.png"/> Nobody’s saying it’s ‘cause of the Phantom Thieves… so far. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-YusukeBlue.png"/> People think he did it because that tabloid exposed how he was covering up Kamoshida’s abuses. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-AnnSummer.png"/> Could it be that… we’re responsible for Principal Kobayakawa’s suicide…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-RyujiSummer.png"/> Whaddya mean? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-AnnSummer.png"/> If we hadn’t changed Kamoshida’s heart, maybe this never would have happened… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-RyujiSummer.png"/> But then Kamoshida woulda kept doing what he did if we didn’t go and take him down. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-FutabaTankTop.png"/> There’s a lot of opinions online. “It’s only natural that he died.” “Covering up crimes is wrong.” <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Opinions.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Same, same.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-YusukeBlue.png"/> The comments I’ve seen are similar as well. “Only the Phantom Thieves are on our side!” “I wish the Phantom Thieves would take down the police and the politicians of this country!”<br/>
<br/>
Oh, don’t worry, folks. We’ll take care of the cops, all right.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-AnnSummer.png"/> It’s not just the news. There’s even Phantom Thieves merchandise now. I never expected we’d end up such a big deal… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-YusukeBlue.png"/> It seems like the public would rather believe in us than in the adults. People are trying to get the Phantom Thieves to solve societal problems, not just personal ones. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-AnnSummer.png"/> This is kinda scary… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-MakotoSummer.png"/> Are we really doing the right thing…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-RyujiSummer.png"/> I mean, the principal was coverin’ stuff up, right? I guess… he got what was comin’ to him. <br/>
<br/>
Dark, Ryuji. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-MakotoSummer.png"/> That’s… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Morgana.png"/> Whoa, guys, let’s get back on topic. Weren’t we going to discuss the data we obtained from Niijima? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-YusukeBlue.png"/> Why me…? <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-YusukeBlue.png"/> It seems she is searching for a common thread to tie them all together. Some parts seem to be speculation, but she has cited a beneficiary of the majority of these incidents. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-YusukeBlue.png"/> The corporation Okumura Foods. More prominently, its CEO, Kunikazu Okumura. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-RyujiSummer.png"/> Okumura? I feel like I’ve heard that name somewhere… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-YusukeBlue.png"/> From Big Bang Burger.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-AnnSummer.png"/> You know, they only got famous sometime in the past few years. They even had a branch in Hawaii.<br/>
<br/>
The scene where the group talks about Big Bang Burger’s… err… explosion into the restaurant world and their parent company Okumura Foods is the sole sequence in the entirety of the Hawaii trip with any direct narrative purpose, and it’s just to set up this conversation. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not opposed to the idea of some totally inessential downtime for the group. It’s not that the game couldn’t use some fluff where the group just hangs out and relaxes; god knows there was plenty of that in Persona 4. But the Hawaii trip comes at a particularly inopportune time in regards to the story’s flow and pacing, feels pretty redundant after the earlier beach visit, and tragically just isn’t that fucking interesting at all. Persona 5 is a game that simultaneously feels loose as hell pacing-wise and way too rigid and tight for its own good, because while it has a lot of extraneous scenes, most of them are still plot-related and only exist because the game needed a better editor, meaning the game feels really overstuffed and none of the characters have a chance to fucking breathe. Most of the “gang hanging out” scenes have been unfortunately relegated to the text conversations because there’s legitimately just no space left on the game’s calendar for most of it. Hell, that more than a few plot-critical conversations happen via text message says a lot about how this game is structured. <br/>
<br/>
But that’s enough of that rant.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-MorganaAngry.png"/> This is too suspicious though. Only one CEO is profiting from these seemingly accidental incidents. I think it’s natural to suspect he’s intentionally causing them. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-MakotoSummer.png"/> I get that, but still… <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-RyujiSummer.png"/> Dammit! <br/>
<br/>
Now, you may ask, “Hasn’t Morgana been a massive asshole to Ryuji for the entire game?” or “Why the fuck are we spending valuable time dealing with Morgana’s poorly-fleshed out inferiority complex that adds nothing to his character besides making him incredibly unlikable?” or “What the fuck is even his plan?” or “Why should I even care that the cat who seemingly does nothing but narrate my life all day is gone?” or “This seems like a petty-as-shit grievance to full-on quit the team over, doesn’t it?” or “This bit stopped being funny three questions ago, are you finished yet?” Well, don’t worry! All this just means it’s time for...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Dumb.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
Why, yes, I do believe it’s that magical part of the game where poorly-established character traits that will never be mentioned again after this take over the entire plot for multiple hours in a row! Who needs organic, compelling character growth and logical story progression when you can just have a character selfishly commandeer the narrative for the sole benefit of themselves?<br/>
<br/>
Look, if I wanted to watch characters be assholes until the plot happened at them, I’d go play Persona 3 again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-MorganaSad.png"/> ……<br/>
<br/>
I should mention that while I don’t actually hate Morgana I have absolutely no stake in his existential crisis whatsoever, mostly because he’s kind of a dick about it but also somewhat because in a sense it’s just a retread of Teddie’s whole deal in P4. Imagine that, I’m favorably comparing <i>Teddie</i> to something.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-MorganaAngry.png"/> All right. I’ve managed by myself before, and I can do it again now. I just need to take down Okumura before those guys do…! <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-GoroSummer.png"/> I’m experiencing equal levels of frustration. My comments on TV turned everyone against me.<br/>
<br/>
Oh boo fucking hoo, people are mad at you when you get paid to appear on TV. Cry me a river.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-GoroSummer.png"/> Then again, I won’t allow mere criticism to break my spirit so easily. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sae.png"/> We won’t keep letting ourselves be defeated either. My suspicion after the hacker’s case last month is now conviction thanks to the principal’s death. The mental shutdown cases and the psychotic breakdowns are surely the Phantom Thieves’ doing. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-GoroSummer.png"/> I remember the data you showed me about Okumura Foods. Is that the basis for these beliefs? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sae.png"/> There have been frequent occurrences of mental shutdowns surrounding Okumura recently. If only there was a clear connection between him and the Phantom Thieves… Well, it would be problematic if there wasn’t one. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-GoroSummer.png"/> So you’re jumping the gun here. <br/>

DAAAAAMN, Akechi! Fuckin’ smoked her! <br/>
<br/>
It’s great to see someone actually <i>get</i> how weird and messed up Sae is. “Wait, you threatened the owner of a restaurant you like with revocation of custody… and then have the nerve to go <i>back?</i>” Of course, Sae won’t care because she’s a goddamn sociopath, but it’s nice to see someone at least attempt to cut her down to size.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sae.png"/> It’s all for the sake of the case. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-GoroSummer.png"/> You may have the backing of the SIU’s director… but you’ve been far too aggressive, Sae-san. You’re trespassing into police territory. Don’t say nobody warned you if this becomes an issue later. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-GoroSummer.png"/> We first need to know what methods the Phantom Thieves are using. The police can’t make a move unless that becomes apparent, after all. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Sae.png"/> This opponent can’t be caught by following the rules. What need is there to stick to formalities?<br/>
<br/>
Uhh, if you don’t know anything about the Phantom Thieves, especially how they do what they do, then you have basically no chance of catching them even ignoring the rules. Akechi’s a fucking cop, yeah, but he seems like the only rational one in this conversation.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-GoroSummer.png"/> So you wish to ignore protocol in order to reform society? I hope you realize that’s no different than what the Phantom Thieves are doing. It’s a shame, especially since we both want to capture the culprit behind the psychotic breakdowns… <br/>
<br/>
With that, Akechi walks away. <br/>

Worth noting: that was one of the only days in the entire game that was spent “normally” (read: we woke up in Yongen and fell asleep in Yongen) where we had no opportunity to control Maaku. Or, in other words, it’s one of the only days in the game we spend at home where we don’t hear “Beneath the Mask” in any form (at least at night). Normally we at least get the chance to walk around Leblanc’s attic and check the news, but it skipped right past that. In addition, outside of the Sae flashforward there were only two dialogue options. Weird.<br/>

Um, he’s not here, so… yes.<br/>

Well, uh. That’s certainly <s>contrived</s> a crazy random happenstance. Who’da thunk that the day after we find out about this Okumura dude the teacher brings him up apropos of nothing at all? It’s almost like this game is incredibly on-the-nose!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-Inui.png"/> With his logical management skills, he revived his company that was on the verge of bankruptcy. He then started Big Bang Burger, a bold and creative venture.<br/>
<br/>
So true. Big Bang Burger only hires the finest hamburger <i>artists</i>. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-Inui.png"/> Okumura’s words are a philosophy on life itself! How could she sell that to a second-hand shop…?<br/>
<br/>
I thought she “threw [it] out.” <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-Inui.png"/> But, in times like these, getting one’s mind to switch gears is key. Wouldn’t you agree, Hamiru-kun? Second-hand shops are also known as thrift stores. Do you know when the earliest ones appeared? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="111-071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-Inui.png"/> Correct. They were mostly run by religious or charitable organizations, of course… But larger businesses could donate unused stock to them, and use them as a tax write-off that way. It takes incredible business acumen to figure out how to be both profitable and charitable at once. <br/>
<br/>

<b><i>Foul: Improper Semicolon Use; Five-Yard Penalty.</i></b><br/>

Hold up, I’m being told the coach will challenge, saying that semicolon here is technically not a violation because the two clauses are both independent. Let’s see what the referees have to say about this. <br/>
<br/>
Hm? The refs are back, and according to them “it’s technically permissible, but no rational human being would use a semicolon like that instead of a regular colon,” and so the penalty stands. They also say, and I quote, “I’m a massive hypocrite, lol, because I have no idea if I formatted that penalty call correctly.”<br/>
<br/>

I mean, let’s think about this. Sure, it makes sense that he’d go there, because he said as much yesterday. But, um, how and <i>why</i> would he commit felony vandalism? Not only does he have no real reason to break shit, he’s a fucking <i>cat.</i> How would he possibly manage to deface a statue even if he was trying? In a game that made more sense I’d just assume it was a freak coincidence due to that, but we’ve got narrative economy on our side, so let’s just assume he did do it somehow. <br/>
