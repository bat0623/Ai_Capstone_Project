	<b>Part 99: 9/6: Mementos Sucks</b><br/><br/>
Really sorry this update’s so late, folks. I’ve been a bit busy as of late, and looking at what this update entailed… can you blame me?<br/>

<br/>
We’ve been putting this off for far too long, and now we reap what we sow. It’s not just a Mementos update, but by far the longest one yet. May God have mercy on our souls.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> We’ll start with this one first… This intel is on an <b>atrocious land speculator</b>. He’s trying to threaten the old couple who manage the theater in Yongen to make them move out. If we don’t do something, things will probably get even worse.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoSummer.png"/> So he’s trying to do this because they declined his offer. We cannot allow such a horrible method to succeed.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-YusukeBlue.png"/> Very well. I will go along with this.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> There are still more. Next is… This intel is on a malicious <b>cheating gamer</b>. Apparently he’s been cheating at the arcades to show off recently. It’s been nothing but an annoyance to the other customers though.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-RyujiSummer.png"/> Let’s change that immature jerk’s heart fast. We’ll show him that a real man fights fair and square. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-YusukeBlue.png"/> Very well. I will go along with this.<br/>
<br/>
...Really? No objections? Makoto? This dude is cheating at a video game, he’s a minor annoyance at absolute worst. Fine, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> There are still more. Next is… This intel is on a <b>harassing boss</b>. He steals the achievements of his underlings without doing any work himself, all for his own profit. Apparently many of the workers have quit because they couldn’t handle his spiteful nature.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoSummer.png"/> Using his position of power for wrongdoing? Such a horrible boss must repent for what he’s done.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-YusukeBlue.png"/> Let us beat that rubbish mentality into submission.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> There are still more. Next is… This intel is on a <b>dangerous assailant</b> who’s shown up in Shibuya recently. He only targets the weak. Many have already fallen victim to him.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-RyujiSummer.png"/> Seriously? The hell are the police doin’ about this? Guess we gotta be the ones who punish this dude.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-YusukeBlue.png"/> Let us beat that rubbish mentality into submission.<br/>
<br/>
You don’t need to chime in on every single one, Yusuke, especially if you don’t have that much to say. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> There are still more. Next is… This intel is on a <b>college student who is abusing animals</b> to relieve stress. Apparently a lot of cats have died by his hand… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-AnnSummer.png"/> How can someone even do that!? I don’t believe this. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> I could never forgive a human like that. This will be revenge. There are still more. Next is… This is about that doctor in Yongen-Jaya, Takemi. She’s in a real pinch right now. An old boss of hers, Oyamada, is trying to crush her clinic to save himself.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-RyujiSummer.png"/> This is the doctor in Yongen? Shit… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> This guy is hiding some serious medical mistakes. It turns out he’s quite the criminal. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-RyujiSummer.png"/> All right, we gotta operate on that dude’s rotten heart then! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> OK, it looks like we’re all ready to do this! We already told Mishima, so the forum post is up and running. There are still more. Next is… This intel is on the <b>couple related to Kawakami’s former student</b>. They are quite the foul pair of people. They’re using the incident where that child died to try and extort money from Kawakami. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-AnnSummer.png"/> What…? Threatening her is bad enough by itself, but using a deceased child to do it… That’s just too much. We have to do this. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> Mm-hm. I’ll show off my skills in front of Lady Ann. <br/>
<br/>
Well, at least none of the others had to find out about Kawakami’s side job.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> OK, it looks like we’re all ready to do this! We already told Mishima, so the forum post is up and running. There are still more. Next is… This intel is on the <b>stage mother</b> who mistreats her daughter, the shogi player Hifumi Togo. She controls every aspect of Hifumi’s career, and has thus ruined her daughter’s shogi life. She forced Hifumi to become an idol against her wishes and even plans to fix her upcoming shogi match. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoSummer.png"/> She’s treating her daughter like some kind of tool. We have to release Hifumi from that state.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-YusukeBlue.png"/> Very well. I will go along with this.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> OK, it looks like we’re all ready to do this! We already told Mishima, so the forum post is up and running. No objections, right? Mm… we’re good to go if you’re OK with it. That’s a unanimous decision! OK, all that’s left now is to take down the target in Mementos! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ominous.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-RyujiSummer.png"/> Yo, how many targets we got? 8 of em, yeah? Let’s do this. <br/>
<br/>
<i>Eight targets</i>. Kill me.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> It’s gotten even bigger. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-AnnPanther.png"/> This happened because we stole another Treasure… right? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-RyujiSkull.png"/> I feel like it’s gonna keep gettin’ bigger and bigger. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-FutabaOracle.png"/> I don’t think Mementos’s territorial expansion is caused by us stealing a Treasure. I bet it’s things like the number of searches for “Phantom Thieves,” the ranking of trending words… And the access counter on Mishima’s website and stuff. Even now, it’s slowly expanding. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeFox.png"/> The more we become the topic of conversation, the more Mementos spreads…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-FutabaOracle.png"/> *nods*<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-MakotoQueen.png"/> Maybe it’s the other way around… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-RyujiSkull.png"/> Whaddya mean? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-MakotoQueen.png"/> We’re the ones expanding it… Or perhaps, Mementos grants further passage as we become more prevalent in the general public’s cognition.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-RyujiSkull.png"/> Like… gettin’ free admission for bein’ popular? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeFox.png"/> That’s rather well-put.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-RyujiSkull.png"/> For real? That’s amazin’! Actually, you’re amazin’, Futaba! How’d you figure that out? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-FutabaOracle.png"/> Piece of cake. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> I didn’t know at all… What have I been doing…?<br/>

<br/>
First things first, let’s get fusin’.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Music:</b> <a href="https://clyp.it/vqwgcmqp?token=066612d6fe19121f880850863e3f59cd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Aria of the Soul</a><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We’re going after our next Strength request, a Lachesis with Tetraja. The simplest way there is through fusing another Ame-no-Uzume using Principality and Lamia. You may remember that Ame-no-Uzume was the target of a previous request, which is why we’re not going to be registering this version in the Compendium/Inmate Registry (in case we want to make completing this Confidant easier in New Game Plus, because the Inmate Registry carries over). We could also try to just Gallows our Clotho, which also knows Tetraja and we’re going to be getting rid of this visit anyway, but I prefer to do these requests the traditional way (and don’t really want to deal with random skill selection).<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-013.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Next up, Lachesis from Ame-no-Uzume and Isis. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Lachesis.jpg"/> The thread of fate is measured by my hand… I am the mask which determines your future…<br/>
<br/>
Lachesis is another of the Moirae Sisters, or sisters of fate, from Greek mythology. She was the one who apportioned how much thread of life each mortal received. She was also the one who was said to choose each person’s destiny after measuring their thread.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-016.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Finally, Jatayu from Lamia and Suzaku.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Jatayu.jpg"/> I will gladly sacrifice my body to help you. If it brings you glory, a new mask I shall become.<br/>
<br/>
Jatayu is a valiant bird from Hindu and Malay legend. From what I’m reading here, it attempted to rescue its old friend Rama’s wife Sita from the devil-king Ravana (and lost) in the Hindu epic Ramayana, as well as defeat its uncle, the giant bird Garuda, in the Malay story Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa (it lost there too). I’m not sure how I feel about having a twelfth of my soul dedicated to the Southeast Asian Bird of Jobbing, but this Persona will come in handy soon anyway.<br/>
<br/>
If you’re wondering what skills I gave this Persona, it was Mafrei, Ominous Words, and Marin Karin.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Now, as mentioned earlier, this Clotho is old and busted. Lachesis is the new hotness. Sorry, girl, we traded up for your sister. It also occurs to me that we haven’t shown off the Electric Chair yet, and Invigorate 1 is a decent skill, so let’s do this.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-020.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
Yikes.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And all that was left is a smoking item. This game’s fusion animations are fucking gnarly, I tell you what. Also in relation to Clotho, here’s what she looked like in <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/godofwar/images/0/00/Sister_Fate.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080528072222" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the ever-understated God of War 2 (NSFW)!</a> Sometimes I look back on that series and go, man, that was mid-2000s as fuck. What in the hell were we thinking? New one looks cool though, I guess. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Caroline.png"/> Looks like you’re getting the hang of this. Well, that’s another assignment done… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Caroline.png"/> No difficult questions, Justine. Just give him his assignment. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Justine.png"/> Understood. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Caroline.png"/> Huh…? What’s with you? You’re not usually this cooperative. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Justine.png"/> I have no intention of abandoning my duty… but I would like to know the truth of this situation. After all, we possess a mysterious list which seems to have foretold the current state of affairs… Who wrote it? Why do I recognize the penmanship? Why does observing growth feel nostalgic? And beyond that… what was the true intent of its creator? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Caroline.png"/> I thought I said no difficult questions… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Justine.png"/> To be honest though… I have arrived at a hypothesis. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Caroline.png"/> What!? You know the answer…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Justine.png"/> We manage the inmate’s power via several arcana, which symbolize the mystic nature of this world. In truth, the encounter we share with him is represented by the Strength arcana. Strength represents great power, a mighty will, and the awakening of the unknown… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Caroline.png"/> Sounds about right. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Justine.png"/> Caroline… In our interactions, has the inmate been the only one to have had something awaken within him? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Justine.png"/> Perhaps… therein lies the answer. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Caroline.png"/> Wh-What’s that supposed to mean!? Ughhh, dammit! Why do I feel so weird…!?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I’m sure whatever you’re discussing is important and all, but I really don’t give a shit about any of it and it doesn’t really seem to have much to do with me. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Caroline.png"/> Sh-Shut it, Inmate! Can’t you see we’re in the middle of something!? And we already told you, there’re three tasks you’ve gotta do before you get your next reward! Although… this next task is gonna be the eighth one. There aren’t too many left on the list. You’ve come this far, Inmate. I hope you see it through. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Justine.png"/> If you do so… the answer will surely become clear.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Caroline.png"/> And, uh… You’re more than just some random shmuck to us now…<br/>
<br/>
Aww.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Caroline.png"/> You’re the only one who can find the answer we’re looking for. You got that, Inmate!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-ProtagNoGlasses.png"/> <i>I feel like my bond with Caroline and Justine is growing deeper...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Caroline.png"/> OK, next! You’ve only gotta bring us one more Persona before you get another reward! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Justine.png"/> We would like you to harbor within you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Caroline.png"/> You got that? A <b>Hecatoncheires</b> that knows <b>Masukunda</b>!<br/>
<br/>
Well then, we’ve got eight fucking targets to take down today, so let’s jump right in.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-RyujiSkull.png"/> Those two look pretty sure of themselves. Real smug lookin’.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeFox.png"/> So they’re blackmailing that teacher, Kawakami, by using that incident where their child died.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-AnnPanther.png"/> But Ms. Kawakami did nothing wrong, right? We have to help her! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> Are you ready? Let’s go. <br/>
<br/>
Seems like we’re starting right off with the worst of the bunch.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This fight isn’t terribly difficult, but the reason there’s no video is just because I decided to try some confusion money farming… which only one of them is vulnerable to. Mr. Takase will throw money away no problem, but the Mrs. is a different story, and I waste a lot of time and SP before I decided to just look it up and confirm she wasn’t susceptible. It ends up working out great for me anyway, though: Mr. Takase was throwing out anywhere between 18-30 thousand yen every time it happened. This isn’t an ideal fight to farm money from, especially because they can use Masukukaja to lower your odds of hitting them with Confusion, but while he only threw away money a handful of times, it was still more than worth it.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of what attacks they use, it’s really just basic medium Ice and Electric spells from the wife and husband respectively, some Physical attacks from Mr. Takase, and the occasional Bufudyne (Heavy Ice damage) from Mrs. Takase. As evidenced by these guys being the first targets we come across (though there’s one we missed and are going to have to loop back around for at the end), they’re pretty weak by virtue of the fact that we could theoretically have gone through Kawakami’s Confidant and reached them a month or two earlier in the story.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This fight takes… a lot of turns, so we get a few opportunities for Futaba’s new skill, Moral Support, to activate.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-039.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Her current rank lets her apply party-wide buffs at random points in the battle, something Rise could also do in Persona 4 Golden. These include:<br/>
<ul class="bbc-list">
<li>Party Attack up<br/>
</li><li>Party Defense up<br/>
</li><li>Party Agility up (in previous games this was known as Hit/Evasion to signify that it represented both your hit and evasion rates, but in the future I’ll just refer to this as Agility because it’s simpler, even though one of the Persona stats is also Agility and that might get a bit confusing)<br/>
</li><li>Party HP recovery (generally moderate)<br/>
</li></ul>
Now, there’s also one more, which Rise didn’t have. While I still think the absence of one specific skill from Rise’s toolkit means Futaba isn’t quite as broken as her, well...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Full-party Heat Riser is pretty goddamn fucked (Heat Riser is a skill that boosts all three parameters of Attack, Defense, and Agility at once. In Persona 4 Golden, Chie’s ultimate skill Dragon Hustle, which cost more than half her SP even at level 99, also let her apply a full-party Heat Riser. As you can imagine, this is stupid broken and can easily turn the tide of a fight). Reminder that Futaba learned Moral Support at <i>Rank 1</i> of her Confidant, which was mandatory. As we rank Futaba up, we’ll unlock more functions of Moral Support that are also amazing, including one that’s somehow even better than this one, if you can believe that.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of things relevant to systems that aren’t in Persona 4 like being surrounded or Mementos mapping, full-party Heat Riser is the only thing Futaba can do that Rise couldn’t. Still, incredible.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-ShadowTakase2.jpg"/> It felt nice to see him gradually break down from working so much… <br/>

I guess there’s actual confirmation that the Takases totally worked Taiki for profit the same way they’re working Kawakami, yikes. What horrible fucking people.<br/>

I’m just now realizing how weird it is that two different people have the exact same distortion, to the point where they appear together in Mementos and have their changes of heart linked. It’s not bad, just… interesting.<br/>

That Envy Chain we got is a new weapon for Ann, which despite its <i>garbage</i> Attack rating, has a high chance of inflicting Despair. We’re not really using Ann’s melee attack with any real frequency, so equipping it’s not a major loss, especially for such a debilitating status ailment. <br/>
<br/>
Next up, Tsuboi, the cat abuser.<br/>

Naguri has a huge health pool, but also takes an absurd amount of damage more than normal enemies. My first attack, a medium Psy spell, did 455 damage to him. Rakunda + Bufula broke 1k. He’ll use Tarukaja, but even with that, his only move worth worrying about is Swift Strike. It’s a really easy fight.<br/>

Oh shit, a Charge skill card. Charge (and its equivalent for magic skills, Concentrate) boosts the power of the next Physical skill you use by 2.5 times. Rakunda plus Tarukaja plus Charge equals some Fist of the North Star, exploding a dude with your pinky shit.<br/>
<br/>

And you’d know, Fox!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-Kishi.jpg"/> That’s my way of management. It’s efficient—I give the orders, and my underlings do all the work. It’s a pretty easy job. As long as the numbers go up, that idiot president won’t say anything. If my underlings have a problem, they should just get promoted. But since I evaluate them...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-AnnPanther.png"/> How did someone like you ever get promoted? If I were the president, you’d be fired! <br/>

<br/>
Kishi will use Brain Shake to inflict Brainwash, but has a rather small HP pool and doesn’t seem to have many more tricks than that… until he casts Diarahan to fully heal himself. He’s weak to Bless skills, though, so we can take advantage of that to take him down before he drags this out too long.<br/>
