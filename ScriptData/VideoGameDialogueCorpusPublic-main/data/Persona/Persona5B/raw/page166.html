<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Murmur.jpg"/> Yeah… I’m definitely gonna vote for him! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chatter.jpg"/> Maybe I’ll actually vote this time… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Chatter.jpg"/> There aren’t many politicians who are like Shido-san!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Morgana.png"/> Haha. I guess it must be hard, even for you. Now that we know who’s behind it all, we can’t get hasty. Rushing will just make us sloppy. But geez, it’s been getting cold lately. We might freeze to death before we can change his heart. Let’s look to see if we can find anything to help us get warm. <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Morgana.png"/> It’s so warm… Once we take care of Shido… …… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Morgana.png"/> Hm? Well… I was just thinking… This might be the last job for the Phantom Thieves. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh no, serious time!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Morgana.png"/> Everyone’s goals and ambitions… They’re all linked to taking down Shido. That’s how I feel. We all became phantom thieves for our own reasons. We weren’t just playing around. Outside of the Phantom Thieves, you also have friends who’ve been helping you. They believe in you. We have an important battle ahead of us, and we only made it all this way because of them. <br/>

<b>Hint hint pay attention you idiot, this is the end of the game and you’re about to run out of time to max your shit</b><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Morgana.png"/> Haha, you’re right. Then again, you didn’t die, even though you were killed, right? The others are tough too! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Aww.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Morgana.png"/> This upcoming battle is personal, so we’ll do it your way. Now you can fight Shido on your terms! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-ProtagNoGlasses.png"/> *nod*<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Kawakami.png"/> I believe I mentioned this before but Hamiru-kun is back at his family’s home. It’s a private matter, so don’t go spreading rumors. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Ann.png"/> How long can we keep this up? We need to take care of things before we get caught… <br/>

<br/>
For the rest of the game, the “roaming” music has been changed to this track. Spooky.<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-RyujiChat.png"/> Bullshit.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-YusukeChat.jpg"/> A dead man cannot go to school, you know. It would all be for nothing if they found out he’s still alive. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Yes. We need to be careful to make sure we’re not being watched as well.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-HaruChat.jpg"/> Want me to get special servants for this situation?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-AnnChat.png"/> You really think like such a rich girl! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-MakotoChat.jpg"/> We’ll have to be particularly careful when we gather at the hideout. Everyone will need to make sure they’re not being followed.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-FutabaChat.jpg"/> K, I’ll watch out.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-YusukeChat.jpg"/> That wasn’t directed at you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-FutabaChat.jpg"/> Hrghhh…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-RyujiChat.png"/> This is the final showdown, so let’s watch our steps. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-FutabaChat.jpg"/> That’s so unlike you, Ryuji!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-RyujiChat.png"/> Shuddup! Anyways, let’s get this shit started. We’ll be waiting for you to contact us.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-MorganaAngry.png"/> OK, so—you’ll stand out too much during the day, so we need to go at night. We’re about to face our toughest target to date. Don’t skimp on your preparations. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Then don’t give me more shit to deal with, <i>gosh.</i> JK Mishima, you know I love you.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-MishimaChat.png"/> Anyway, here’s the info I have… This one is cruel.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-MishimaChat.png"/> I dunno, like selling them “magical vases” or something. Anyway, they keep moving around, so it’s been difficult to reliably track them. Apparently the police have just stopped trying entirely… From what I’ve read online, their representative is a guy named Yoshihito Wakasa. Sorry I don’t have any more info than that. Good luck.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Morgana.png"/> It might be tough for us to go at a time like this, but the info itself is pretty worthwhile. If we have the chance to head into Mementos, he’d make a great target. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-020.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-021.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Protag.png"/> <i>There still seems to be enough fuel left...</i><br/>
<br/>
Sadly, despite what this sentence implies, there is no riveting fuel-fetching mechanic for the heater. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-TV.jpg"/> Taking into account the current political chaos, the period until the election is unusually long. Election day is on the 18th of next month. Each party is in for a long fight.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-MorganaAngry.png"/> The election is on the 18th. We better make sure to settle things before then! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Old_Woman.jpg"/> He’s a very eloquent man, and it’s very impressive to hear him live. He’s got a lot of promise. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Old_Man.jpg"/> I always thought politicians couldn’t be trusted, but I think he’s someone worth voting for. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Sojiro.png"/> ...Then again, I’m sure no one’s gonna be looking for someone who’s supposed to be dead. <br/>
<br/>
Now it’s time for everyone’s favorite LP tradition, Talking To Every NPC In The Game!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Old_Man_2.jpg"/> It’s because they finally caught the Phantom Thieves. That boy, Akechi, is a real hero. I’ll admit, I don’t have much hope for young people, but this one shows a lot of promise. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Boom_Box.jpg"/> The leader of the Phantom Thieves who died was just a kid! His capture was really sudden, and things happened so fast that it was hard to keep up.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Old_Man_3.jpg"/> To think that a kid could be guilty of murder… This country’s going down the drain. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Mother.jpg"/> I don’t think so. The Phantom Thieves aren’t here anymore.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Dog-loving_Girl.jpg"/> You’re a liar! The Phantom Thieves are superheroes! They have to come and make Kotaro feel better…<br/>

The Sweet Potato Vendor now has 50 SP restoring potatos, though we’re limited to one per customer.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Woman_8.jpg"/> Ohoho… You know, I’ve actually met Shido-san, during one of my hus-buddy’s functions. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Woman_9.jpg"/> Is that so? We just met him the other day, while joining the supporters association. He seemed quite nice. Were you at the event?<br/>
<br/>
Ha, Modest Housewife has changed to Not-so-modest Housewife.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Girl_8.jpg"/> The most shocking thing to me is that the Phantom Thieves are minors… They’re around our age, right? High school…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Boy_14.jpg"/> Usually this stuff gets posted on the Internet. I can’t seem to find anything, though… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That Angel Tart we heard about on TV a while back is finally available. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Reporter.jpg"/> Leave those two for the others. I want to uncover the truth about the Phantom Thieves. This is our chance; it’s what everyone wants to know! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Young_Cameraman.jpg"/> You’re right… It could be quite the scoop!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Taxi_Driver_1.jpg"/> Because of the election campaign speeches? Yeah, sucks they held ‘em during peak business hours. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Bickle.jpg"/> That Shido guy was there, I hear. There’s a huge crowd wherever he goes. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Taxi_Driver_1.jpg"/> Makes sense. He’s always on TV, plus he’s pretty charismatic. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Protestor.jpg"/> However, the traitorous apostles, the Phantom Thieves, have fallen. That is quite comforting.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-BDL.jpg"/> You are wrong. The delinquency of my apostles is part of the government’s wicked conspiracy! I return to purge the darkness! Now, listen to the voice of the Ultra-Electromagnetic Sun God! <br/>
<br/>
Woohoo! The Sun God is back!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Woman_6.jpg"/> Oh, is this your motherly side? Your daughter is in high school now, isn’t she?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Woman_7.jpg"/> She goes to Shujin Academy. I’ve been worried for her since I heard the Phantom Thieves go there. I finally felt relieved when I heard they caught their leader, but this is rather shocking… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Man_7.jpg"/> They say “please” so much, they sound like pick-up artists. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Man_5.jpg"/> I don’t care about the election… It’s not like we’d get girls by changing politics… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Man_7.jpg"/> Master, why do you look so down? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Fishy_Hawker.jpg"/> Buy these wonderful study guides, and you too can become a genius like Akechi-kun. S’il vous plait? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Woman_6.jpg"/> Ah, maybe I’ll buy those for my son. Akechi-kun is really quite impressive, after all. It’s true that if you want your son to succeed and join the elite, education will be real important.<br/>
<br/>
The elites won’t need all that fancy book-learnin’ when we break out the guillotines.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Fishy_Hawker.jpg"/> Ahh, yep. So your signature here, then, s’il vous plait… <br/>
<br/>
I love that Fishy Hawker uses pretentious French. That shit’s canon.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-Promoter.jpg"/> You don’t know? That’s right. There’s no way to know! And that’s why we plan ahead. With Wanna-B-Alert’s security guarantee, you’ll be safe in times of unpredictable danger! Before the year’s end, won’t you finally start putting a priority on safety… before it’s too late? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Winger.jpg"/> It’s surprising that no one knows that boy’s identity. I thought for sure the police would leak it. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Lawyer.jpg"/> I suppose they’d want to keep that info to themselves after salvaging their dignity with that arrest. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Winger.jpg"/> It’s too bad that he died, though. I really wish I could have represented him. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Office_Worker.jpg"/> The announcement’s finally been made though. This country’s future is all depending on--<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Maid.jpg"/> All they’re doing is kissing everyone’s ass. We don’t know what those politicians are really like. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Office_Worker.jpg"/> W-Wait, but having a new ruling party could really make big changes in Japan! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Man_3.jpg"/> That suicide leaves a real bad taste in my mouth. And we never found out who they were… We’ll have to get Mr. Shido to expose them! Murderers don’t deserve any rights! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-Nerd.jpg"/> There’s no info on the internet, either. There’s got to be some huge, dark conspiracy here… <br/>
<br/>
I know there’s an actual conspiracy, but the way these idiots are talking about it makes me think they’re gonna start some #PAnon bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Busy_Young_Man.jpg"/> What!? You’re just going to throw away the celeb lifestyle? It’s just over the horizon! I just bought stocks for companies that are donating a lot to Shido! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Woman_7.jpg"/> All you talk about is money. There’s no point in us being together… <br/>
<br/>
Holy fucking shit, you go girl! Finally breaking up with this loser! I’ve been rooting for you this whole time!<br/>
<br/>
Now that we have that out of the way, let’s listen to some random reactions to Shido and Akechi.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-Shido_1.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-Shido_10.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-Shido_11.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Shido_12.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-Shido_13.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-Shido_2.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-Shido_3.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Shido_4.jpg"/><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Shido_8.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Shido_9.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Fucking low-information voters! <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-argh.gif" title=":argh:"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-Shido_14.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-Shido_15.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-Shido_16.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Akechi really is dreamy, huh.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And now that we’re finally done with all of the chatter, we can head over to Haru. As I mentioned earlier, our goal for now before heading into the Palace is to max out our remaining Confidants. There’s only one problem: we’re legally dead and can’t be spotted at school! What to do…? Well, we can at least hide near the school gate, so let’s do that. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-062.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Morgana.png"/> All right… Let’s sneak past everyone and go up the emergency exit. <br/>
<br/>
Breaking onto school grounds seems like a great idea, sure! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="111-064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And so we make it up here. I have no idea what happens if you need to see Ryuji or Makoto, though. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-065.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="113-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Thanks to our Confidant Rank with Haru, we get 3 Moonlight Carrots instead of 2.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="114-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And we go right back to planting more. These will be ready on the 29th.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-068.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="117-HaruGym.png"/> I’m thinking of going to find some books to help me study coffee. Would you mind coming with me? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="118-070.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="117-HaruGym.png"/> Thank you! How about Jinbocho? It would be the perfect place to look. Well, let’s get going. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-072.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Haru.png"/> It says here that the type of roast you want should differ depending on how you want to drink your coffee. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-073.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="123-074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Haru.png"/> You know, Okumura Foods didn’t start out as a burger chain…<br/>
<br/>
“We actually started out as a pancake house.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Haru.png"/> Originally it was nothing more than a small cafe run by my grandfather. That particular shop closed before I was old enough to appreciate the finer intricacies of coffee… But that’s where the real origin of our family business lies. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="124-075.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="125-076.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Haru.png"/> At any rate, after my grandfather passed, the company shut the cafe down due to its steady loss of revenue. He had never cared about turning a profit though. His only goal was to make people happy. He built a strong community around the cafe… He’d even give out free meals to those who could afford it. Then the day it closed, people lined up for blocks to give flowers. They really loved that place… <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Haru.png"/> I know we need to do well to keep our employees paid, but I can’t help but think we’ve lost something important. I mean, Takakura-san seems to only be focused on profits… At this rate, we’ll never lose our black image.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Haru.png"/> Oh, I get it! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="129-080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It’s really not that funny. Please don’t laugh so hard, it’s embarrassing.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Haru.png"/> You were trying to cheer me up, weren’t you…? Thanks for that. *sigh* I think what I really need… is to get stronger. I mean, I can act tough in front of my employees… but you know how weak I am inside. <br/>
<br/>
Don’t use words like “weak.” I prefer “delicate.” Like a beautiful, pure cinnamon roll.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Haru.png"/> Before I can really determine who I trust, I first need to know what it means to have others trust in me. So, I’m going to get stronger… strong enough for you and the others to rely on me!<br/>
<br/>
I mean, you already shoot things to death with a grenade launcher. Strength isn’t really the issue. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Protag.png"/> <i>I can sense a firm resolve from Haru...</i><br/>

<br/>
Ah fuck.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Haru.png"/> S-Sugimura-san…!? What are you doing here? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="135-Sugimura.png"/> I was just heading home from a business engagement when I saw you from my car window. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="136-086.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="135-Sugimura.png"/> ……! You’re one of those brats from before… <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you kicked my cat into a wall, motherfucker.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="137-087.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Haru.png"/> Um, this is a friend from school. He’s helping me look for some books today. Anyway, we should be getting back to our shopping. Please excuse us. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="138-088.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="139-089.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="135-Sugimura.png"/> Oh yeah? And what about the contract I made with your father? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="141-091.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Haru.png"/> A contract could never hold the same weight… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="135-Sugimura.png"/> Are you sure about that? Think about the reparations clause. If you back out of the deal now, you will lose everything you own. Okumura Foods, your estate… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Haru.png"/> Even so, I… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="135-Sugimura.png"/> And what about your employees? Are you really willing to put their jobs on the line for the sake of your selfishness?<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like this reparations clause is really fucking sweeping, eh? Why would Okumura ever have agreed to this, even if he was absolutely certain it would never be invoked?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="135-Sugimura.png"/> Besides, this marriage is exactly what Okumura Foods needs right now. My father would have no trouble managing your shares or sweeping away your company’s tarnished image. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Haru.png"/> …… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="135-Sugimura.png"/> That reminds me, did Takakura-san tell you about the wedding hall? He got us the Phoenix Wing at the Wilton. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="142-092.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="135-Sugimura.png"/> He made a provisional reservation for ten days this coming spring. After all, the sooner the better. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="143-093.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="135-Sugimura.png"/> We’ll have to look into our guests’ schedules as well. There’ll be over three hundred of them, you know. Takakura-san can handle Okumura Foods in the meantime. Why don’t you go stop by the gym or something, Haru?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="144-094.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Okay, first, fuckin’ what the hell is wrong with this dude!? Second, how can you even tell if she needs to lose weight? She’s wearing the bulkiest sweater in the world.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="145-095.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="135-Sugimura.png"/> I’m out of here.<br/>
<br/>
Sugimura leaves. What a fucking creep. And Maaku was completely silent for all of that, what a hero. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="146-096.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="147-097.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="148-098.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Haru.png"/> He has everything… Fame, intelligence, manners…<br/>
<br/>
Manners!? He just called you fat!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Haru.png"/> The only thing he needs now is a wife he can control… And I guess I’m the perfect target. He’s going to get Okumura Foods as well as my entire inheritance… and I’m totally powerless against him… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="149-099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
See, to me this just sounds really patronizing, but that’s yet another example of Me Not Really Understanding The Tone Of A Dialogue Option!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="150-100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Haru.png"/> ...Thank you. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="151-101.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Haru.png"/> For today though… I’m rather tired. Would it be OK if we parted here? Well, goodbye. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-FutabaChat.jpg"/> Akechi too. I can’t believe they’re calling hi mthe detective of the century! Plus they’re treating the Phantom Thieves like criminals.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-AnnChat.png"/> That side of things has faded a little bit though, don’t you think? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Yes, all the talk of the elections must have made people forget about the suicide news. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-MakotoChat.jpg"/> The main culprit is “dead,” things are settled, and society can go on like normal. That’s probably what people are thinking… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-AnnChat.png"/> Hm. I have mixed feelings about all of this. I’m not saying they should talk about us more, but the sudden change in momentum is weird… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="154-104.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That second response says “hasty,” not “nasty.” I was staring at the image for a while and it didn’t make any sense.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-FutabaChat.jpg"/> Everything up until the elections is the real battle! Let’s take him down! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-HaruChat.jpg"/> Well then, we can discuss this more tomorrow! Let’s do our best!<br/>

I accidentally hit X near the coffee siphon and realized I had never gotten the Kawakami prompt, so here it is. It’s just a brief explanation of how calling Kawakami to make coffee works. <br/>

As before, we really have no other choice but to try to do some menial tasks that won’t really benefit us anymore at night, as there are no more night Confidants to advance. Here, I’m just trying to get the trophy for reading all the books because why not, right?<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Morgana.png"/> Secret technique, huh? Sounds like something phantom thieves would use… I think. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="164-111.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Morgana.png"/> It was full of secret techniques for a bunch of games… We could beat any video game we want now! Well, I guess it’s up to you whether you actually want to use any of these cheats. <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="166-113.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Here’s a fun thing that they <i>don’t</i> tell you: if you actually try to use any of these cheats, Morgana goes “oh, that wasn’t very exciting,” even though he was cool with it a second ago! Even for the dumb gambling game that’s 100% luck! What a dick.
