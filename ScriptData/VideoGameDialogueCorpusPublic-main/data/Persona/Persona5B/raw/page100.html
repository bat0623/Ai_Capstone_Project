<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Sojiro.png"/> You some kinda misfortune magnet or something? Just don’t bring any bad luck down on me, got it?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoChat.jpg"/> No, my sister still hasn’t come home.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-RyujiChat.png"/> Mannn, she’s seriously that busy?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Probably because of us. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-AnnChat.png"/> So, uh.. do you still want to go through with this…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Yes. I can do it. Hold on, I have a message. It sounds like she’s on her way home.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-RyujiChat.png"/> All right! It’s finally time! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Understood. I’ll report back tomorrow.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> Oooh, I can’t wait to see what comes of this… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-TV.jpg"/> But who did it? Could #Millennials be possibly involved? We investigated to try and get to the bottom of this. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> Wow, everyone’s so interested in the Phantom Thieves. Make sure you don’t blow our cover, OK? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I’m gonna murder all the rich people, old man, and you can’t stop me.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-006.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-007.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Becky.png"/> By the way, is your house ever going to get air conditioning? Maid outfits get too hot during summer and really cold in winter. They’re so impractical. Oh, well. Does your room need cleaning, or did you need me to cook for you? I provide all sorts of services! But, um… there’s stuff I need to talk to you about, so would you request me? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Becky.png"/> I’ll be heading over right away, thennn. Please wait for me, Master! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Becky.png"/> …… But I have to say goodbye to it today. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Becky.png"/> The thing is, I’ve decided to quit! ...My boss found me a part-time job that pays better than this one. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh no.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Becky.png"/> Takase-kun’s guardians keep increasing their demands… ...So this is just what I have to do. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-015.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Becky.png"/> Takase-kun’s guardians say the only way to apologize to Takase-kun is by paying them. If that’s not true, then what’s the right thing to do here…? I wonder if I can escape all this if I quit being a teacher. People like me have no right being a teacher. If I quit on my own, I won’t have to pay them… That’s why I’m going to quit both my teaching job and my maid job… What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-017.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Becky.png"/> But did I really decide it on my own…? Now that I think about it, it’s too late for me to stop being a teacher. If I really felt bad for what happened, I would’ve resigned the day he died. And yet, I still felt the need to teach… I wonder why I feel that way even now. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Becky.png"/> ...Hamiru-kun. …… Oh, that’s right… I decided the way to apologize to him was to make sure there won’t ever be another student like him. Because I might’ve been able to save him if I hadn’t been afraid of rumors or labels back then. I wanted to become a teacher who takes care of her students. That’s the mindset I had! But now, I spend all my free time at part-time jobs, just so I can continue working as a teacher. I put the critical work of a teacher on the back burner, so I could make “apology” money. That’s where it all went wrong… I can’t make things right with Takase-kun like this… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Becky.png"/> I’ll be the teacher I aspire to be… That’s the right way for me to make amends to Takase-kun. From here on, I refuse to pay them any more money! And that is my answer! ...Well, what do you think? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-021.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Becky.png"/> ...I learned that from you. In a way, you’re MY teacher. ...Haha, just kidding. <br/>
<br/>
This fall on Disney Channel, experience the heartwarmingly funny tale of the teacher who might just have more to learn from her students than the other way around! <sub>and also she’s a prostitute</sub><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Protag.png"/> <i>I feel Kawakami’s trust in me strengthening...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Becky.png"/> I’ve been so worried about making money that I haven’t been paying attention to my students. Especially to you. I averted my eyes from you because you were labeled, just like Takase-kun was… But from now on, I’m going to protect you too. As your teacher, I will never betray you.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The first option here is hilariously weird and line-crossing, even if it fits with the tone of the conversation better. Therefore I went with the second option, which is basically the equivalent of responding to “I’ll defend you with my life” with “Cool,” and just seems ridiculously non-chalant.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Becky.png"/> I’ll speak with the Takases. I’m not going to run anymore. Everything should be fine as long as I talk to them face to face. All right, it’s time for me to go. Thank you… I’ll see you later. Good night. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Sae.png"/> I’m listing up the evidence that’s been taken into storage. It’s a chore that any part-timer could do. I don’t have time to waste on something like this… I felt like my irritation would show on my face at the office, so I brought it home. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-MakotoSummer.png"/> Sorry to hear. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Sae.png"/> The Phantom Thieves case isn’t so easy that I could pursue it in my spare time… The media keeps making a ruckus about it, so people have been wary whenever we make inquiries. Why, I couldn’t get anything out of a man who seemed to have intel… I even tried threatening him. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yikes.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Sae.png"/> All I did was question him a bit harshly. <br/>
<br/>
It’s unclear, but I think it’s possible she’s talking about Sojiro, in which case this is a hilarious understatement. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-MakotoSummer.png"/> Oh, I almost forgot… I’ll be going on a school trip starting next week… The senior faculty are being questioned, so I’ll be going in their stead… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Sae.png"/> Sounds good to me. The school will owe you for it. It won’t get in the way of your entrance exams, will it? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-MakotoSummer.png"/> Not at all. ...Feel free to take a bath first. I… need to study. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Sae.png"/> OK. I think I’ll do that. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-028.jpg"/><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-MakotoSummer.png"/> …… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
A progress bar appears onscreen.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-MakotoSummer.png"/> This should do it, right? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Shit!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Sae.png"/> I want to change my toothbrush. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-MakotoSummer.png"/> I-I bought a new one already! It’s on the shelf! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Sae.png"/> Thanks. <br/>
<br/>
HOT TOOTHBRUSH REPLACEMENT ACTION<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-MakotoSummer.png"/> Hurry…!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
An extremely soft thud can be heart from the bathroom, so quiet I had to rewind the video and turn my volume all the way up to hear it. There’s zero chance anyone playing this on a TV would have heard this, is what I’m saying. Also Sae’s been in the tub for maybe twenty seconds at this point.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-035.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It's pretty great that according to the portraits Sae bathes fully clothed because they couldn't be bothered to give her a whole second outfit.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-MakotoSummer.png"/> It’s so close to being done too…!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Sae.png"/> What is it?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-MakotoSummer.png"/> I bought a new bath salt. It’s on the same shelf, so would you mind putting it in the tub?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Sae.png"/> Not at all.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The process completes.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoChat.jpg"/> I have to head to school right now though… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-FutabaChat.jpg"/> Whoa! My bad! Bring it right after then. I’m gonna punish you if you’re lateee!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> Looks like it went well! I wonder what we’ll find… Oh! Before that, we should get over to school! <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Boy_4.jpg"/> He knew all about Kamoshida, but kept his mouth shut. Ridiculous… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Boy_5.jpg"/> Well, let’s vote him up on the Phan-Site. I can’t imagine the Phantom Thieves wouldn’t go after someone so rotten. I’m sure other teachers knew, too. Anyone who did deserves a change of heart. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Boy_4.jpg"/> Yeah… But, wait! What if it messes up our school trip? Maybe we should wait until after.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Inui.png"/> Your destination is none other than Hawaii. I hope your passport isn’t about to expire. You’re heading out on Wednesday, so there’s no time to get a new one printed.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Wednesday.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Monday.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
HMMMMMMM<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Inui.png"/> Anyhow, I’m sure you’ll enjoy your time sightseeing in Hawaii more if you have more knowledge. <br/>
<br/>
Fucker, I’m MAXED<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Inui.png"/> Now then, Hamiru-kun. Look closely at this picture.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yes, really. That’s his name.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Inui.png"/> In this famous statue, he’s holding a spear in his left hand, but what does he have in his right? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We’re gonna get sued.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Inui.png"/> That’s correct. He’s actually just holding his hand in the air. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Inui.png"/> As an aside, it seems that this statue is not of King Kamehameha himself. <br/>
<br/>
I want you all to know that “Kamehameha” does not set off my word processor’s spellcheck. Dragon Ball is real, y’all.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Inui.png"/> After Kamehameha’s death, another king commissioned the statue, using a boy from his court as the model. <br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Knowledge +1</b>. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Inui.png"/> I hope you will make the most out of your five days there. Let me just say that I have a fondness for macadamia nuts, so… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> Souvenirs, huh… I definitely wouldn’t want to get some wooden figurine. I can’t understand why people would send things like that as gifts… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Kawakami.png"/> I repeat, Hamiru-kun, please come to the Student Guidance Office. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> That sounded like Kawakami. I wonder what’s up… <br/>
<br/>
Hmm, what could Kawakami want with us during lunchtime? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Kawakami.png"/> I told them… that I’m not going to pay them any more money!<br/>
<br/>
Good for you!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Kawakami.png"/> I’m going to devote myself to being a great teacher! No matter what others say, I won’t waver. So, thank you for giving me such good advice. I just thought you should be the first to know… <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-MrsTakase.jpg"/> How rude… I guess a student is only as good as his teacher. Obviously you lack a proper education. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-MrTakase.jpg"/> You thought you could just call and say you’re not going to pay anymore? Who do you think you are? <br/>
<br/>
Wait, I thought she said she was gonna do it in person? Guess she got cold feet?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Kawakami.png"/> It’s what I decided, for Takase-kun’s sake. I’m going to make sure there won’t be any more students like him, who… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-MrsTakase.jpg"/> So you’re just trying to get out of your responsibility? I bet you don’t even care about Taiki! How are you still a teacher? Maybe we really should sue the Board of Education! Are you OK with that? A teacher who caused her student to die would surely cause a scandal. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Kawakami.png"/> If you want to take legal action, then go ahead. Regardless, I’ll continue teaching. I’ve decided that that’s the best apology I can make to Takase-kun. Paying money to you two is not the solution, to say the least! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-MrTakase.jpg"/> Hmmm… Along with suing you, maybe I should tell everyone about your little secret… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-059.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
AH, FUCK<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Kawakami.png"/> How did you…!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-MrTakase.jpg"/> Oh? So I’m right, am I? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-MrTakase.jpg"/> I mean, the amount of money you’re paying us can’t come from just a teacher’s salary. Well? Shall we head on over to the faculty office? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-MrTakase.jpg"/> Hah! A teacher working in the sex industry? You’ve definitely done it this time. How unfortunate for you that you thought you could just leave Taiki’s matter unsettled… You know what you have to do now, right? Pay up! And don’t ever call us again with this garbage about stopping the payments!<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Kawakami.png"/> Please don’t. A Shujin teacher asking the Phantom Thieves for help would be…<br/>
<br/>
Who said anything about the Phantom Thieves? I was going to break into their house and kick them until they stop moving. Holy shit, what awful people.<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-AnnSummer.png"/> Come on, food’s more important than some turtle. You really don’t find steak this big and thick in Japan! Also… mahi-mahi? Is that some kind of fish? Think it’s good?<br/>
<br/>
I thought Ann’s deal was sweets, not meat. You’re infringing on Chie’s gimmick!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-YusukeBlue.png"/> It seems that it’s the season for schools all around. We’re going on our school trip as well. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-RyujiSummer.png"/> Yeah? Where you guys goin’? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-YusukeBlue.png"/> I believe it’s Los Angeles. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-AnnSummer.png"/> Ahaha, that doesn’t suit you at all, Yusuke! I bet you wanted to go somewhere like Nikko or Nara. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-YusukeBlue.png"/> Anywhere is acceptable. Natural mineral pigments used for Japanese art was also originally imported. <br/>

<br/>
I dunno guys, it’s so hard to pick, and I’m just a little distracted by the fact that my homeroom teacher is being forced into selling her body against her will to raise money to pay her blackmailers. That’s still pretty fresh. But I’m sure whatever you fucks are goofing off talking about is pretty important too.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

Just no wooden figurines. He hates those, apparently.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-Futaba.png"/> Hmm, there’s a lot, so it’s not happening overnight. But I’ll manage by the time you guys get back. I demand souvenirs from Hawaii and LA for my reward. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-AnnSummer.png"/> I don’t really get all this, but you’re as amazing as always, Futaba! I guess it’s called an information war? It’s so high tech and modern, it kinda reminds me of a movie.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> We’re the Phantom Thieves, so it’s not that big a deal. I mean, I can turn into a car and stuff too… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-RyujiSummer.png"/> C’mon, don’t try and compete with her. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> What did you say!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-AnnSummer.png"/> You’re fine the way you are, Morgana. Like, you’re cheeky cute? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> Cute… Lady Ann… I… <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-RyujiChat.png"/> What?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoChat.jpg"/> The teachers have asked me to chaperone the trip in their place. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="111-088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Yes. I was worried about how many troublemakers will be there.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-RyujiChat.png"/> Are you talking about us!?<br/>
<br/>
Wait, what? I just said I’m glad she’s coming and she immediately turns around and insults me?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-AnnChat.png"/> But why are they having you go at all, Makoto?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-MakotoChat.jpg"/> It seems some teachers have to stay behind to deal with that tabloid article. So, they decided to get a couple of third-years to act as additional chaperones. It seems a few others besides myself will be going as well.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-AnnChat.png"/> Oh, I see.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Either way, this overseas trip has been truly long-awaited. I expect leaving Japan will be a great eye-opener for us. This is a wonderful opportunity, so we should be sure to enjoy it.<br/>

<br/>
I’m fucking serious you guys, Iwai’s Confidant so far just seems to be a random mishmash of every single Yakuza game.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="127-Homeless_Man_2.jpg"/> Though you’d figure something that massive woulda got more people talkin’ about it… Maybe they leased some kinda high-end club to keep it as private as possible…? I didn’t hear a thing about that though. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="123-Iwai.png"/> Depends on how quick the parts come in. Some stuff’s prolly gonna have to go through customs… How long things get stuck there’s totally outta my control though… <br/>
