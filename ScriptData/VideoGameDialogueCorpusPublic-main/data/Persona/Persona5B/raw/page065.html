<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chouno.png"/> The humidity is what kills me about Japanese summers. I miss the dry heat of California. Not to mention, July and August both have thirty-one days. Summer is long… Now then, Mr. Hamiru! Do you know the reason why July and August both have thirty-one days?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
No really, that’s the correct answer.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chouno.png"/> Great! That’s right. You may already know this… But the months of “July” and “August” are named after the Roman emperors Julius and Augustus. Augustus named a month after himself, just like Julius. However, he felt like he would be losing if his month was shorter than Julius’, so he added a day. It’s a mystery why men are so stubborn and prideful over silly things like this.<br/>

Maaku gains <b>Knowledge +1</b>.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chouno.png"/> Well, as far as you’re all concerned, you’re just lucky to get a long vacation. But before that, you have exams. They start on the 13th of next week. Don’t forget, OK?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> Next Wednesday, huh… You’d better make sure you study.<br/>

We head over to the Velvet Room and fuse this Jikokuten from Orthrus and Rakshasa to free up a slot to resummon an Eligor.<br/>

Anyway, now that we’ve gotten that done, we can get the boost for having an Emperor Persona for Yusuke’s Confidant.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeBlue.png"/> Meanwhile, I am here to observe the public in an attempt to refresh my mind. Do you need something?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Protag.png"/> &gt;I came to see you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeBlue.png"/> *chuckle* You must have a wealth of free time if that is your decision. I have some news for you. My piece “Desire” has been accepted into the public exhibition. It is on display as we speak. Would you like to come see it with me?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Protag.png"/> &gt;Hang out with him<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeBlue.png"/> Then let us head to the museum. To be honest, I have yet to actually go there myself. This should be quite lovely. *chuckle*<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We can now take people to the art museum in Ueno.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeBlue.png"/> Hm, I believe my piece truly stands out among the sea of art here. And yet, nobody has come to see it… Perhaps they are so afraid of the truth held within that they dare not take a closer look. <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I’m sure it’s that, buddy.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Woman_6.jpg"/> There’s a dark, almost sinister aura emanating from it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Storeowner.jpg"/> Hm, the title is… “Desire”? I see no desire here. Ah, I understand now. This area is for students. The artist likely decided to paint this on a whim.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Woman_6.jpg"/> Indeed. There is neither elegance nor emotion in this piece. Come, dear. There are much more detailed paintings over there.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeBlue.png"/> ...There is no need to worry. I am not bothered in the slightest. That was nothing more than the drivel of unrefined commoners. I needn’t pay any mind to them. As long as those who are in the know understand my work, I will be happy.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeBlue.png"/> I would like your opinion, sir… What are your thoughts on this piece?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Art_Patron.jpg"/> I can see quite clearly why it was accepted into the exhibition. The technique is excellent. However… The composition as a whole is mediocre at best.<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Art_Patron.jpg"/> The title is listed as “Desire”… but that idea is quite overused. Some may even call it stale. If you want to paint an abstract work with such an old theme, you must inject some individuality into it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeBlue.png"/> What…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Art_Patron.jpg"/> Take another look. Try to remove yourself from the artist’s bias. These brush strokes are splendid given your age… but does this painting really tell you anything? It is empty, devoid of meaning. <br/>
<br/>
...Well, I liked it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Art_Patron.jpg"/> I suggest you take a more critical eye to your work in the future if you truly want to progress as an artist.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeBlue.png"/> But… why? I put my heart and soul into this piece, captured the very essence of desire… It was supposed to lay bare the reality of the world…! Perhaps… Perhaps he was right. It may be empty after all… These colors, these brush strokes… They do not convey the true meaning of desire, only my conception of it…! I haven’t captured desire… Desire has captured me…!<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-RyujiChat.png"/> Looks like we’re all clear then.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-YusukeChat.jpg"/> We can’t be sure of that just yet.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-AnnChat.png"/> You mean he might not have had a change of heart?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-YusukeChat.jpg"/> No, I’m relatively certain he did. That is not the issue. Despite Kaneshiro’s change, his organization remains intact. I can only hope they don’t abscond with the photographs.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-RyujiChat.png"/> Y’mean like, run off with it? I guess that is possible…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-YusukeChat.jpg"/> After all loss of the leader does not necessarily spell out the demise of the group. That is merely common knowledge.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Hopefully Kaneshiro’s confession motivates the police to crack down on the mafia… I would love nothing more than to see them defeated once and for all.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-RyujiChat.png"/> That part’ll be up to Makoto’s sis.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-MakotoChat.jpg"/> That aside, we’ve done everything we can for the time being. All that remains now is to wait until the result becomes clear.<br/>

We head back to the Velvet Room because we need a Star Persona for Hifumi and we don’t have any in the Compendium yet. First we fuse this Clotho from Orobas and Eligor.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Clotho.jpg"/> Spin and spin, the thread of fate… I am the mask which can see your past…<br/>
<br/>
Clotho is one of the Greek sisters of fate (also known as the Moirae sisters), who are personifications of fate. Clotho is the youngest and spins the thread of life. Their threads control the life of every mortal being, including the gods.<br/>
<br/>
Also because we don’t have the Fortune Confidant yet we don’t get the end screen, so just know I gave her Maragi, Marakunda, and Garu in case you care.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
From there, we can fuse Suzaku and Clotho for Fuu-ki, a Star Persona.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Fuu-ki.jpg"/> I’ll become one of your masks and work as though I were a raging thunderstorm within your heart!<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Protag.png"/> &gt;Hang out with her<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-MakotoSummer.png"/> Thank you. It will be nice to have you there when I talk to her. Wait for me in the student council room. I’ll call her in.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-MakotoSummer.png"/> Both myself and Hamiru-kun here saw you there. Based on where you were heading, we assume you’re working at a store called the After School Salon. How is it, working there?<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Eiko.jpg"/> Whaddya mean? It’s just a normal cafe. They make me wear a costume and stuff, but that’s it. Oh, and I don’t hafta do anything weird, if you know what I mean. It’s all totally legal.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-MakotoSummer.png"/> Hm. So you’re sure nothing strange is going on?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Eiko.jpg"/> Yup yup, the worst I get is some weird old guys gawking at me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-MakotoSummer.png"/> I see… Beyond that though, why are you working there? ...How’s your financial situation?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Eiko.jpg"/> Uh, fine? I mean, I can just ask my parents for cash whenever I want.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-MakotoSummer.png"/> O-Oh, I see...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Eiko.jpg"/> But they’d totally bug me about what I’m buying if I did that. That’s why I work at the salon. I got some good spending money, plus the guys who come in there like, mega pamper me.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Eiko.jpg"/> It’s nice having people treat you like you’re special, y’know? I’m sure a super honor student like you gets that all the time though. Anyways… are you gonna tell on me? You even brought a witness today… Hold up, doesn’t that mean you were in Shinjuku together? What’s up with that, Miss Prez?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-070.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-MakotoSummer.png"/> At any rate, don’t mind him. As for you… I don’t plan on telling anyone.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Eiko.jpg"/> Ohhh, I get it! So we’re like, protecting each other’s secrets? Oh crap, and I just realized your boyfriend’s that rumored criminal… You’re a real badass, Miss Prez!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-072.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-MakotoSummer.png"/> I was just worried you were getting wrapped up in some shady business, so I asked him here for support.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Eiko.jpg"/> Hmmm… Eh, whatever. Btdubs, I was wondering...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-MakotoSummer.png"/> Huh? You know Buchimaru-kun…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Eiko.jpg"/> I had like, tonnns of Buchi stuff back when I was a kid. What a blast from the past! Wait, why’s it so beat up!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-MakotoSummer.png"/> Well, it was given to me when I was still in elementary school… I’d like to buy a new one, but they’ve stopped selling Buchimaru-kun merchandise.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Eiko.jpg"/> OMG, this is too hilarious! The student council president has an adorable pencil case? My image of you has done like, a complete 360 today.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-MakotoSummer.png"/> Um… isn’t that a full circle?<br/>
<br/>
that’s why they call it the xbox 360<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Eiko.jpg"/> Mmm, I dunno, I’m just real surprised. You don’t really look like the kinda person who’d be into that stuff. I mean, I always thought you were kinda like a robot, but I guess I just had to get to know you better. Hey, why don’t we trade phone numbers!? I really wanna talk to you more about Buchimaru-kun… and your boyfriend.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-MakotoSummer.png"/> Wait, he’s not my boyfriend...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Eiko.jpg"/> Aaand saved! Oh crap, it’s this late already? I’ve gotta get to work. I’ll send you tons of pics of my Buchimaru-kun collection later though. Bye byeee!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-MakotoSummer.png"/> Honestly though, I’m in shock. She thought I was a robot...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Now, I know you want me to pick “Beep boop,” and trust me, it’s killing me that I can’t. I’ve picked that option before, because it’s amazing, and I’d do it here but I can’t, because Makoto gets mad at you and you don’t get any points, and we need those points to unlock the next rank. All she says is “Don’t tease me!” which isn’t worth spending an extra day unlocking the next rank. Still, Makoto needs to loosen up, because if she can’t appreciate how funny “Beep boop” is, that’s a real shame.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-MakotoSummer.png"/> You know, I believe what Takao-san said about me is how others think as well. I thought I had changed after the incident with Kaneshiro, but perhaps it wasn’t enough… That aside, it was almost inspiring to meet someone so distinct from myself. I’m going to try to look at things a little differently from now on. And, well… I think that will help me break out of my shell. I hope you’re ready. I’m going to show you how useful an honor student can really be.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Protag.png"/> <i>I can sense a quiet resolve from Makoto...</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-MakotoSummer.png"/> Perhaps I can correct her misconceptions about you… And as always, I’ll let you know if anything important happens. Well, see you later.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-Kawakami.png"/> I’m changing my lesson for today. Instead of a regular class, we’ll be reviewing last week’s materials. I suggest you listen carefully. But don’t think you can slack off, OK? I absolutely won’t allow it. No slacking off!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> Kawakami’s graciously given us this free time, so we’d better put it to good use. So, what’s the plan?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-087.jpg"/><br/>

Kawakami’s giving us some time off in her own class, finally.<br/>

I need to tell her to lay off with the double entendres, this is really bothering me.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Protag.png"/> &gt;Call her over<br/>

I mean, there’s nothing left for me to hide from you, so the truth comes out, you know? Now that I think about it… I’m glad you’re the one who found out about me being a maid. Are YOU going to be all right in this dusty room? And have you been eating well? You need to eat fresh vegetables, and none of that instant stuff. Vitamins are super important! You’re going to turn out like me if you don’t take care of yourself!<br/>
