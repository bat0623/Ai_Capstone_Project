Oh hey, random lady I met once a month ago. I totally remember you.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ohya.png"/> Morning! Going to school now? I’m just heading home! The morning sun is too bright...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Ohya.png"/> I pulled an all-nighter. Journalist Ichiko Ohya works around the clock, you know! Well, you work hard on your studies.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-AnnSummer.png"/> So, whose heart do you want us to change?<br/>
<br/>
Getting right to the point for once, I like it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-MakotoSummer.png"/> ...A mafia boss.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-RyujiSummer.png"/> What’re you talkin’ about!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-MakotoSummer.png"/> That’s what they call themselves. This group seems to be the cause of the rise in phishing scams. What’s worse, once you’re in their sights, they won’t stop threatening you until you get what they want. They’ll force you to take part in their scams, threaten your family, and ultimately destroy your life.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-RyujiSummer.png"/> Holy shit...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-MakotoSummer.png"/> It appears that their victims include some of our students.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-AnnSummer.png"/> No!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-MakotoSummer.png"/> They primarily target juveniles.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-RyujiSummer.png"/> What’s their boss’s name?<br/>
<br/>
Ryuji, actually being forward-thinking.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-MakotoSummer.png"/> Nobody knows.<br/>
<br/>
Well, uh. Fuck. Can we get an easier one?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-MakotoSummer.png"/> The victims are being threatened not to testify, so even the police can’t get a grasp of the situation.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-AnnSummer.png"/> That’s where you want us to start!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-MakotoSummer.png"/> You should be able to pull it off… If you’re really the righteous Phantom Thieves. Or is Akechi-kun correct when he says you act without justice?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> Can’t you say something witty back at her?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I have to.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> I knew you were gonna say that!<br/>
<br/>
Another fun detail of that response I like is that Makoto has no response to it. She just totally ignores you.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-MakotoSummer.png"/> Their main hub of activity is in Shibuya… That’s all the information I have. You have two weeks. Once that has passed, I’ll submit all the evidence I have to the police and to the school.<br/>
<br/>
Two weeks!? We had more than that for even Kamoshida, and we knew his name!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-MakotoSummer.png"/> I hope you don’t let me down...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-RyujiSummer.png"/> “Don’t let me down”… Dammit, she was just bossin’ us around...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> Come on, we should get in touch with Yusuke.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Sae.png"/> Are you saying that Makoto was sticking her nose into this Phantom Thief business…?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Sae.png"/> That’s not the issue here…! Why would Makoto...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Sae checks her watch again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Sae.png"/> Fine. I’ll listen to everything you have to say before I decide the truth of your statements.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-YusukeBlue.png"/> The mafia? Hm...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-AnnSummer.png"/> Can we really do this…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-RyujiSummer.png"/> …...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> Either way, we have almost no information on our target. This guy’s a crime boss, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he had a Palace. Still...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-YusukeBlue.png"/> Isn’t this a prime opportunity for us though?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-AnnSummer.png"/> How!? We’re in huge trouble!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-YusukeBlue.png"/> Even after we punished an evil man who seemed to be good, the public did not acknowledge us. However, if we take down an actual criminal, let alone a target the police don’t have answers for...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-AnnSummer.png"/> Oh, right…! That might make people believe in us!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-RyujiSummer.png"/> I get it! That means even Akechi’ll hafta acknowledge us as the Phantom Thieves!<br/>
<br/>
Have you idiots learned nothing? We need a better hideout.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-RyujiSummer.png"/> Whaddya say, leader?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-RyujiSummer.png"/> Hell yeah! We just gotta do what we always do!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-YusukeBlue.png"/> Our time limit is two weeks, correct? We can’t afford to waste too much time. ...I’ll ask around Kosei and see if there are any victims.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-AnnSummer.png"/> OK, I know some girls who go to Shibuya pretty often. I’ll check with them about it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-RyujiSummer.png"/> All right, then I’m gonna see what I can find on the net. <i>(to Maaku)</i> That leaves our school up to you and Morgana. You figured out what to do during the whole Kamoshida thing, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> I’ll back you up.<br/>
<br/>
I feel so much better knowing the cat is here with me.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-RyujiSummer.png"/> All right, let’s get back together at the end of the week once we’ve got all our info! I’ll get in touch with you guys later!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-YusukeBlue.png"/> Well, it’s… I had a yearning to see the “Sayuri”… So, if you’re heading homeward, I’ll accompany you.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-YusukeBlue.png"/> Through my artistic career, there have been moments I’ve struggled with particular motifs or techniques… However, those struggles came to pass on each occasion. Yet now I find myself in a similar situation… but the more I try to escape it, the worse it becomes. It seems I am trapped in what we in the art world call a “slump”… Are you aware that I am attending Kosei on an art scholarship? Such coveted grants are not given as charity. I must continually achieve within my field to remain eligible… Were I to lose my scholarship… I would likely have no choice but to leave the school as well. In the earlier days of my career, I would exclusively paint what I desired, when I desired it. The only goal I had in mind was the pursuit of pure beauty… That goal is what drove me onward. I wanted nothing more than to attain the lustrous allure of the “Sayuri” in my own work… Yet what reason do I have now? Holding on to my scholarship? Keeping a roof over my head? Worldly desires are all that spur my brush to move… and the resulting work reflects such impurity of mind. To be honest, I am unsure as to whether I can even call myself an artist anymore...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-YusukeBlue.png"/> ...My apologies. It seems I got somewhat carried away there. But… I simply cannot accept this lack of purpose in my work. That is why I am so upset with my own indecision. Such vague ambition is, in essence, a sin of sorts… Though I suppose allowing my young career to come to an end here would be even more sinful. I only wish to create a work I can be genuinely proud of… Maaku. Please look over there at the “Sayuri.” Her incandescent figure, alluring gaze… That is the meaning of pure beauty!<br/>
<br/>
I’m not sure I would use the world “alluring” to describe my mom, but okay.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-YusukeBlue.png"/> Yet no matter how hard I try to replicate it, an elegance so sweet remains elusive to me…! Why is that, you ask? It is surely because the painter behind the work differs… Because the soul differs…! But if my estimations are correct, the “soul” is nothing but another way to speak of the human heart. What, then, is the heart…? How does it bring forth such beauty? I must understand…!<br/>
<br/>
This is getting a little heavy for me, man.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-YusukeBlue.png"/> …… To be perfectly frank though… I am unsure of how to do so. Maaku… Would you be able to provide me assistance? You have already brought profound change to my world. Hence, I believe you of all people may be able to bring me closer to the truth.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-020.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-YusukeBlue.png"/> At the moment, my art teacher has yet to notice any drastic changes in my work… But I cannot hide forever. Impurity of the heart will undoubtedly seep onto an artist’s canvas eventually. I must go now. My curfew approaches. I look forward to speaking about this matter again.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Protag.png"/> <i>I walked Yusuke to the station...</i><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-RyujiChat.png"/> Now, in my expert opinon, Iida of class 2-D is guilty.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-AnnChat.png"/> You mean Iida-kun from our class? Wait, start at the beginning. What’s he guilty of?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-RyujiChat.png"/> Supposedly he’s been spending money left and right recently. Said it’s because of some great part-time job he got.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-YusukeChat.jpg"/> I see. That may very well be worth looking into.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-RyujiChat.png"/> Right? Can you try asking him about it, Ann? I don’t think he’d be cautious around a girl.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-AnnChat.png"/> In that case, yeah. I don’t mind giving it a try.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-AnnChat.png"/> Thanks, that’s a huge help.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-RyujiChat.png"/> I’m hoping for some great things this time from Takamaki-san’s world-class wonderful acting.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-AnnChat.png"/> Shut it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-YusukeChat.jpg"/> I hopes this will get us even marginally closer to their so-called boss. I leave this Iida to you two. And I have high hopes for your acting as well, Ann.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-AnnChat.png"/> You’re both missing the point!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> Is it true that Iida guy’s guilty? Well, we’ll need to dig up some dirt first thing in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> I can really sense her kindness and tenderness from it. Mothers really are strong. <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Haughty.png"/> Have you ever given it any thought? What is “justice” to you?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Haughty.png"/> I see. That’s one way to look at it, but you only perceive what is on the very surface. The boy who was featured in that TV discussion is still in high school. Akechi, was it? He was well-spoken and skilled in the art of debate—almost as good as I was at that age.<br/>
<br/>
Man, fuck this dude.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-TV.jpg"/> A team of reporters followed a police investigator who is on the mafia case. What was clear is that there is little the police can do.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> Even the police are having a hard time. We can’t let our guard down.<br/>
<br/>

These guys supposedly come asking if you want an easy, high-paying job… But then if you say yes, you get dragged into some real shady stuff… The teachers or student council prez’ll do something about it though.

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Principal.png"/> This is the greatest disgrace in the history of this academy… If it were to be discovered…<br/>

You’re all just ignorant… After all, what’s falling from the sky is acid rain that can melt metal. Hamiru-kun. Let’s test your knowledge and imagination. What would happen if you keep washing your hair with water that’s contaminated with metal?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Hiruta.png"/> That’s right. By the way, your hair will turn green if the metal is copper or red if it’s rust. However, acid rain can’t melt gold or silver. If you want to dye your hair gold, use bronze coins.<br/>
<br/>
Fuck yeah, gold hair. I’m gonna look like the lamest Super Saiyan.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Hiruta.png"/> Thinking you could save money by skipping a visit to the hair salon? ...It seems you still don’t understand the horror of acid rain.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-AnnSummer.png"/> Can you tell me about this easy part-time job? I’m sure you know about it, Iida-kun. Please!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Iida.jpg"/> …… You don’t need my help. A girl like you could probably get a job anywhere, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-AnnSummer.png"/> Huh…!? Ummm… Now that you mention it… Yes… So, um… What I mean is...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> This is going south fast.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-AnnSummer.png"/> O-Oh, Francois! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Iida.jpg"/> Huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> Hey, what are you--<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-AnnSummer.png"/> My cat Francois got run over by a car… and also has an incurable illness! I need money fast!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> That’s not convincing at all… Is she talking about me…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-AnnSummer.png"/> If Francois were to die, I think I’d die too! Probably…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Iida.jpg"/> Come on, don’t talk like that...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-AnnSummer.png"/> If you don’t like it, then tell me about that easy part-time job. You know something, don’t you? I’ve heard the rumors. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Iida.jpg"/> Rumors…!? Was it Nishiyama who--<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-AnnSummer.png"/> Nishiyama…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Iida.jpg"/> Oh, uh...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-AnnSummer.png"/> Hey, what was that about Nishiyama?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Iida.jpg"/> That’s...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> She actually got the momentum back. She’s not acting anymore now, is she? Come on, let’s leave this guy to Ann and go look for that Nishiyama fellow.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
(sarcastic greeting to Mishima)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-MishimaSummer.png"/> You’re looking for something, right? I want to help you out, so please ask me anything.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-MishimaSummer.png"/> So that’s why Takamaki-san was chasing him… Rumor is that he’s been spending money like crazy lately. I also hear that he’s been acting… weird. If you’re curious about Iida, I’d say it’s best to ask Nishiyama… I’m sorry, I don’t know where he is right now… He usually stays till late, so I think he’s probably still somewhere in the school. I’ll keep digging around while you’re looking for him!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> ...Well, I guess we can let him handle this.<br/>
<br/>
(Emphatic denial)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> We’ll have to ask someone else about Nishiyama’s whereabouts. Can you think of anyone who might know?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Newspaper.jpg"/> The student council is on edge. Hurry up… Do you have anything you want to ask about?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Newspaper.jpg"/> I heard the muggings, scams, prostitution, and drugs are making them tons of money. Most of their victims have been high schoolers, leading our school to warn its students as well. But… nobody actually knows how they operate. Even the police are completely lost.<br/>
<br/>
(curious response to relieve insecurity regarding my amount of commentary)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Newspaper.jpg"/> The principal asked for us to come forward with any information we might have, right? I heard someone did come to the student council, saying they were being threatened… I don’t want to assume this of you… but you didn’t have anything to do with that, right?<br/>
<br/>
(faux-offended response)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Newspaper.jpg"/> Iida-kun, from your class? I’ve heard he’s a serious student… Although he has seemed a little down lately. I wonder what happened...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Newspaper.jpg"/> Nishiyama-kun? Are you looking for him? He’s a really serious student with great grades. I always see him at the library after school. The library’s just up on the floor above this one… Why don’t you go talk to him?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Girl_4.jpg"/> Yeah, I heard it’s because of the mafia. They’re even forcing girls to work as prostitutes for them.<br/>
<br/>
(veiled discomfort at the subject matter)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Girl_1.jpg"/> I can’t believe there’s drug dealers in Shibuya now. I wish someone would get rid of them…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Girl_4.jpg"/> Maybe we should ask the Phantom Thieves? They fight for justice, take down bad guys, right?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Boy_3.jpg"/> They can’t just tell us to stay away from Shibuya. I have to go to cram school there.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Boy_5.jpg"/> This is so dumb. The mafia’s just a bunch of lowlife losers, aren’t they? I don’t care if people want to be criminals, but don’t do anything that might affect my life. Geez.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-MakotoSummer.png"/> Ah… It’s nothing. I was just looking at the bulletin. Anyway, how is the investigation going? I don’t believe there’s much time left at this point.<br/>
<br/>
(annoyed rebuttal that there was never much time left, and besides, she gave us this mission yesterday)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-MakotoSummer.png"/> Hm? Perhaps I misjudged your ability? Anyway, this is a very important matter for our school. I hope you can return with good news. And don’t worry… I’ll keep my promise as long as you uphold your end of the bargain.<br/>

<br/>
(mention of overpowering laziness preventing me from making a portrait for this guy)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Generic.png"/> Iida…? How do you know about that? Are you doing something to him!? He’s been acting really strange lately...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Generic.png"/> Wh-What do you mean? Is he really wrapped up in something shady?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Generic.png"/> ...One day the two of us went to Shibuya, and a man approached us over near Central Street. He asked if we were interested in an easy part-time job… I said it wasn’t, but Iida was into it… He was asking the guy all sorts of questions.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Generic.png"/> U-Um, I don’t know… I was so scared I ended up going home alone… But according to Iida, it only takes ten minutes, and is good for people who don’t stand out.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Generic.png"/> Iida statted spending a lot of money. That’s when his strange behavior began too… But that’s all I know… That’s enough, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> A man on Central Street, hm? That is suspicious… Maybe he was making him commit crimes?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-YusukeChat.jpg"/> I have tried looking into this high-paying part-time job myself. People seem to be talking about it here as well. Supposedly a man will talk to you in broad daylight over on Central Street… And your job is to deliver a small envelope he hands you. Well, I will contact you again if I learn anything more.<br/>
<br/>
(reminder to the audience that Makoto said these guys were behind phishing scams, which this is emphatically not)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> So that means this part-time job is somehow crime-related… It takes ten minutes, is good for people who don’t stand out, and involves a small envelope… ...Does that ring any bells? It’s something the mafia would definitely be up to.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> What does that have to do with envelopes? And it’s not really something you can do unnoticed. Hmmm… Any other ideas? It’s something the mafia would commit.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> Like illegal drugs…? Maybe they made Iida smuggle drugs for them. That definitely fits with the small envelope, and you can get arrested just for possession...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-MishimaChat.png"/> Well, I looked into Iida on my own anyway. Rumor has it he got involved in some kind of suspicious part-time job. And that job’s apparently totally insane… Something about trafficking drugs, I think. I hear they ask you to take part in it down on Central Street. In broad daylight, even…<br/>
<br/>
(exasperation at Mishima’s outdated information)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> So he is smuggling… This won’t be pretty. Come on, let’s go back to Lady Ann! We’ll ask Iida directly!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-070.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-MishimaSummer.png"/> No problem. I just want to see you guys succeed. You wanted to ask Iida something, right? He’s still in the classroom with Takamaki-san.<br/>
<br/>
(defeated sigh at no one ever understanding sarcasm)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-072.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> She’s still doing that…? All right, take over for her.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Iida.jpg"/> Hamiru…!? Come on, you too…? I already told you, I don’t know...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Iida.jpg"/> He did!? That bastard… Dammit! …… Shit… Well, if you already know about it, fine… But I don’t want to talk about it here. Let’s go somewhere a little quieter.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-076.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> That’s right! You have to smuggle it to people while it’s still hot! I mean, not that kind of smuggling! Tell him what you heard earlier!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Iida.jpg"/> How do you…? I’ve only told one person about that… Of all people, I can’t believe you were the one to find out… Y-You’re right… They told me they had an easy part-time job for me, and I ended up smuggling drugs… All I had to do was put envelopes into coin lockers, and they said they’d give me a hefty paycheck. I didn’t know what was in the envelopes though! Still, this is what came out of it...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Iida.jpg"/> So you knew, huh… They started threatening me right after they deposited the money into my bank account… They had pictures of me carrying the goods. Said they’d expose what I did unless I paid them off… You know… why are you even asking me this stuff…? Are you just gonna use my job to blackmail me too…?<br/>

That’s where they told me about it… I-I told you everything you want to know, right? Can I go? Well then...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-083.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-YusukeChat.jpg"/> So they ask you to deliver drugs...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-RyujiChat.png"/> That’s serious. I just searched for “Shibuya drugs” and got tons of hits too.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-Clipboard01.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-AnnChat.png"/> So they’re making people traffic drugs, then threatening them…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-YusukeChat.jpg"/> That must be what I heard people talking about in Shibuya. They seem to be going about this quite openly during the daytime. What bold methodology.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-084.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-YusukeChat.jpg"/> I see. Yes, more students will be out during the day, while the police will be more cautious at night.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-AnnChat.png"/> Ryuji, you’re over in Shibuya now, right? Do you see anyone like that there?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-RyujiChat.png"/> Yeah, I’m at Central Street. It’s tough to tell though.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-085.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-AnnChat.png"/> Yeah, that seems like our only choice now. We can split up and search separately then.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-YusukeChat.jpg"/> In any case, we have some new intel. Let us call that progress for today.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-AnnChat.png"/> Whoever asks us to take on that job should know who their boss is too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-RyujiChat.png"/> All right, I’ll get in touch with you guys later tonight and we can come up with a plan.<br/>
