<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-MakotoSwimsuit.png"/> There’s a lot of people here… Are you OK, Futaba?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> <i>(nervously)</i> I’m fine. You guys are here. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> It’s almost lunchtime.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-002.jpg"/><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> Why don’t we eat lunch too? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> I’ll go get some stuff for us then. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-005.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> My staple food. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> What’s up Makoto? You ain’t eatin’ much. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-MakotoSwimsuit.png"/> Oh, um… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> Not feelin’ well or something? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> You just don’t get it, do you, Ryuji? When a girl’s in a swimsuit, she wants to look as slim as possible. Still, you’re worrying too much. Did you make sure to eat breakfast? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> Mona lacks tact. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> So, whadda we do now? Should we play some beach volleyball? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> Oh, sorry. Us girls already made plans to ride a banana boat. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-MakotoSwimsuit.png"/> We could only rent a three-person one. Sorry. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> Wait… Then what about us? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> Keep an eye on our stuff. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> Hell no! Why you gotta treat us like that!? We’re celebrities makin’ headlines! You should treat us better!<br/>
<br/>
Uh, they’re also “celebrities makin’ headlines,” Ryuji. I don’t think they owe you anything.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-MakotoSwimsuit.png"/> I do think they’re not bad in the Metaverse, but in reality… Strange, isn’t it? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> They can steal treasures, but they don’t seem like they can steal a girl’s heart at all.<br/>
<br/>
Please don’t lump me in with Ryuji.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> B-But… Lady Ann… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-MakotoSwimsuit.png"/> Oh, sorry. We’ll go now. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> Banana! Banana! Ugh! The sea is hot! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-MakotoSwimsuit.png"/> Wait up! It’s dangerous if you run around like that!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> Here comes a good wave!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> We risk our lives bein’ Phantom Thieves. There’s no way we’re the same as other guys around here.<br/>
<br/>
Shut up, dude! How many times do we have to fucking tell you?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> Shouldn’t we be havin’ more good times in reality too!? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> We’re special, man. Don’t you agree, Yusuke? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeHoodie.png"/> Well… if you put it that way, you may be right. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> Ann and the others don’t get it ‘cause they’re always around us. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> Hey, how do we get Lady Ann to notice how amazing we are as Phantom Thieves? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> Well, we gotta steal… you-know what. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> You moron, that’s a crime. What we’re gonna steal in reality are… girls’ hearts. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> I see. I just need to prove my skills in reality as well...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> Let’s steal all the hearts with the skills we’ve honed as Phantom Thieves! I’m sure girls will be all over us, considering the vibes we give off! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeHoodie.png"/> Very well, let’s do this. Pulling off our work in reality doesn’t sound bad.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> It’s settled then. So… Mona, you’re in charge of watching over our stuff, OK? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> Huh? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> All right, let’s hurry up and go. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
All right, Operation Babe Hunt 3.0, let’s do this!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The approach...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-015.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and denied!<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-018.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This one seems receptive!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, a wild boyfriend! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Back off before he kicks our ass!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, corner her by the water, this’ll go great.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-023.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-024.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Welp, we suck.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> I dunno… The ocean just looks kinda bland to me… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> C’mon, it ain’t over yet! I’m goin’ for a miracle comeback! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeHoodie.png"/> Hm… I’ve sensed a presence staring at us for some time now. Are we being followed? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-028.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yusuke can read further down the page and wants nothing to do with the next scene. What a smart boy.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Hmm?<br/>

<br/>
Ah <i>christ</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> What’re you doin’ here!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Beefy_Trendsetter.jpg"/> Oh my! I can’t believe we’ve been reunited in such a stunning place! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Scruffy_Romantic.jpg"/> Smells like destiny to me! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Scruffy_Romantic.jpg"/> So, which of us do you think is more manly? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> Wh-What’re you talkin’ about…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Beefy_Trendsetter.jpg"/> Oh dear, your time is up! Sorry, but it was a trick question. The correct answer is… We’re both lovely!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Scruffy_Romantic.jpg"/> You interfered with our duties by not answering the question! I sentence you to… stripping! Oooh, my fashionista skills would be perfect for this! Hands behind your head!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Scruffy_Romantic.jpg"/> The suspects are escaping! Catch them!<br/>
<br/>
Goddammit, Hashino. Well, at least that’s the last time we ever see those two in the main story! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> By the way, where’s Yusuke?<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh hello. Lobsters. Of course. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeHoodie.png"/> While you were busy with your interrogation, I found these beautiful specimens on sale. And so, I decided to spend the last of my money on them. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> Man, you’re real hopeless when it comes to cash… Wait, you were watchin’ us!? Why didn’t you help!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeHoodie.png"/> Apologies, but I was entranced. The moment I set eyes on this distinct shape, I was in love. I haven’t had my core shaken as vigorously as this since the first time Ann entered my gaze. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> Good for you… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Pretentious_Man.jpg"/> C’mon, don’t lie to us, baby. How about you come for a nice cruise on our boat? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Wealthy-Looking_Man.jpg"/> There’s going to be a party too. Tons of celebrities and industry people will be coming along. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> Are you even listening to us!? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Pretentious_Man.jpg"/> Huh, so you were serious about being here with friends. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> That’s what we’ve been saying from the start! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Wealthy-Looking_Man.jpg"/> Don’t you find it boring spending your time with kids like them? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-MakotoSwimsuit.png"/> It’s far more interesting than anything involving you two. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Pretentious_Man.jpg"/> What was that? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Wealthy-Looking_Man.jpg"/> Hey, let’s just let the children have fun with fellow children. We’ll be going now!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-MakotoSwimsuit.png"/> Thanks for coming in like that. Those guys just wouldn’t stop pestering us. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-MakotoSwimsuit.png"/> To be honest, I was nearly at my wits [sic] end. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeHoodie.png"/> By the way, where are Futaba and Morgana? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> I was wondering about that myself. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-043.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Lobsters.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> We did tons of stuff today. All in all, I guess comin’ to the beach was pretty worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, we got shot down repeatedly, almost got sexually assaulted, and chased off some creepy older dudes harassing our friends. What a great day. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LOBSTERS, I DEMAND TO KNOW<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeHoodie.png"/> Agreed. Let’s pack up.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> Futaba seemed fine in the crowd too, so it looks like she’s overcome her last exercise. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> Hey, Futaba. We’re goin’ home. Stop standin’ around and help us. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> All this time, I thought that it was my fault that my mom died. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> Uh-huh...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> It’s because everyone said that I killed her. Everyone looked at me thinking I was a murderer. I ended up hating this world. That’s why I shut myself in and covered my ears. I wished… I wished my mom would come back to life. Sometimes, I’d wake up and think it was all a dream. But nothing had changed in the world. That’s why I’d sleep again. It’d be a repeat of that… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-MakotoSwimsuit.png"/> Ah… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> How she’d work late into the night. How she’d wake up early and make me a boxed lunch every day. How she’d do her best to further her research. How she’d scold me for peeking at her notes. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-MakotoSwimsuit.png"/> It was cognitive psience, wasn’t it? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> “The cognitive world can become distorted through desires. If it becomes distorted, a person begins exhibiting problematic behavior in reality. That cognitive world disappears when you remove its core, and further problematic actions stop.”<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> Isn’t that about Palaces…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> That’s the Metaverse! She knew about that? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> It made no sense back then, but now I understand, after it actually happened to me. All I thought about was my mom. I was trapped in a cognitive labyrinth. I couldn’t get out of it. There was nothing I could do by myself. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> That’s why you asked us to steal your heart? That’s a huge jump in logic in so many ways! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> At first, I didn’t believe the rumors about the Phantom Thieves… That they steal hearts. But I overheard you accidentally. I learned that you were near me. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeHoodie.png"/> Overheard? Ah, the bug… So why were you listening in on Leblanc in the first place? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> I had to keep an eye on Sojiro. Make sure he was actually working.<br/>
<br/>
That’s a really dumb reason! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> Talk about an awful hobby… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> I thought, maybe the Phantom Thieves could cure my heart. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> You could’ve just told us from the start… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> You might’ve been wary of me if I asked out of nowhere. And besides, you could’ve been bad guys. That’s why I cautiously got in contact with you. I checked many times to see how you’d react. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-MakotoSwimsuit.png"/> Yes, you had us twisted around your little finger. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> But, Futaba, you didn’t talk to anyone besides Boss for a long time, right? You must’ve needed a lot of courage to contact the Phantom Thieves. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> ...There were two reasons for it. One was Medjed’s taunt. The Phantom Thieves were so pitiful, it frustrated me. I would’ve been in trouble if they got disbanded too… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeHoodie.png"/> Indeed. You were our only hope. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> The other was what I heard through wiretapping Leblanc. Sojiro was being blamed with lies, like abusing me… He was being threatened to spill everything about my mom… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> Talk about makin’ shit up. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
“Man, I wish I could find whoever did that and kill their whole family” – Ryuji, probably<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> It made me dad, and it hurt. I thought, I have to save Sojiro. I gotta do something. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> So that’s why… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> I didn’t think you guys would be taking such risks for me. I didn’t think you’d worry about me so much. I’m sorry that I acted like I doubted you guys. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> Do you believe in us now? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> Yeah. I can tell. You aren’t bad guys. That's why I have a request. Let me join your team. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> There’s nothin’ to join. You’re already one of us. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> I’ll be honest. Changing people’s hearts isn’t my goal. I want to learn what happened to my mom… The reason why she was killed. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeHoodie.png"/> Killed…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> It was written in her notes. Should the self in the cognitive world die, the self in the real world would lose consciousness… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> Is this about mental shutdowns? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeHoodie.png"/> Then, the criminal that Kaneshiro mentioned… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-MakotoSwimsuit.png"/> Yes, that could be the case. I don’t like pursuing this line of thought, but perhaps your mother’s Shadow was… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> I don’t know for sure… But, right before my mom died, she didn’t seem right. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> In what way? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> No matter how much I talked to her, she wouldn’t answer back. And she didn’t jump into the road. It was more like she collapsed and fell in… That’s why I thought what was written in the notes was real and looked into it. I read books, checked theses that were released online… I even snuck into the networks of various research labs to look at their classified data. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> That’s why you’re good at hacking. ...What kind of brain do you have? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> But, I didn’t figure anything out. My mom’s research was nowhere to be found. <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> I bet it’s them… Those adults in the black suits who read the fake suicide note.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> Futaba… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> If I stay with you guys, I think I can find out more about that world. Then eventually, it might even lead to those men in black. It’s a super-personal reason why I wanna join you… Is that OK? Or would I just be dead weight? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> If anything, you’re dependable. Ain’t that right, Mona? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> Why are you looking at me? Are you trying to say I’m inadequate!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> Well, she was more useful than you, as a matter of fact. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> Hey, that’s inexcusable! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-MakotoSwimsuit.png"/> This is what our Phantom Thieves are like, but I hope we get along, Futaba. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> Thanks. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> Let’s leave those two be… Why don’t we lose no time and decide on Futaba’s code name? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Um, did you hit your head? You’ve already referred to Makoto as Queen in a text chat.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> It’s not cool if we called [sic] each other by our real names.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeHoodie.png"/> Joker, Skull, Mona, Panther, Queen… And I’m Fox. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-MakotoSwimsuit.png"/> In Futaba’s case… “Hacker” wouldn’t be right, would it?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> “Mech”? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-YusukeHoodie.png"/> “PC”?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> No. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> Why don’t we go literal and call her “Goggles”? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> Super lame. You’ve got no taste, kitty. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> Haha, in your face! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> <i>(to Maaku)</i> Do you have any good ideas for Futaba’s code name? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> That’s you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-MakotoSwimsuit.png"/> What would you want it to be, Futaba? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> Hm… “Oracle.” With my vision, I’ll guide you all to victory.<br/>
<br/>
In the original Japanese her name was “Navi,” but I guess Nintendo’s got the copyright locked down on their own annoying helper character names (do not @ me I know that’s not the actual reason).<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnSwimsuit.png"/> Sounds great. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiShirtless.png"/> Then, Futaba’ll be Oracle. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> But man, I never even dreamed that the rumored Phantom Thieves would be so close! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> Same goes to you. To think you’d be the daughter of a Metaverse researcher… Talk about a mysterious fate. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-MakotoSwimsuit.png"/> Should we get going then? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-FutabaSwimsuit.png"/> Yup! Let’s go home! <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-SIU_Director.png"/> This should spur the Phantom Thieves’ support even more now. …… I agree. There are effective ways to use the Phantom Thieves… Now would be the best time to dispose of unnecessary trash… ….whether they’re connected to us or not. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-MakotoChat.jpg"/> This is no longer a matter we can ignore.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-RyujiChat.png"/> Especially cause they might be the one who killed Futaba’s mom. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-YusukeChat.jpg"/> To be honest, I had considered the idea that they might be behind only the rumored psychotic breakdowns… But now it appears as though this person is killing people as well. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-FutabaChat.jpg"/> Technically, they’re making people have mental shutdowns, which then cause them to die.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-RyujiChat.png"/> That’s what happens when you kill someone’s Shadow, yeah?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-AnnChat.png"/> Mm-hm? We were worried about it back with Kamoshida and Madarame, remember?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-FutabaChat.jpg"/> Psychotic breakdowns and mental shutdowns… It would make sense if the same person was behind them. The news never talks about the victims dying, so people only know about the breakdowns. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-RyujiChat.png"/> So this shit’s seriously a case! If that’s for real, whoever’s doing it is some kinda assassin!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-FutabaChat.jpg"/> I’m gonna beat the crap outta them… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-YusukeChat.jpg"/> I would suggest we be more cautious going forward as well. We still don’t know much, even about our Metaverse Nav. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Fuck, let’s just tell them about Igor. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Fuckin’ Ryuji!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-AnnChat.png"/> I wonder if that criminal is using the app too… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Futaba, this seems like your area of expertise. Do you know anything about it? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-FutabaChat.jpg"/> No, I’d never even heard of it before. I mean, it’s not really even an app. It’s more like… a mysterious app-like thing.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-MakotoChat.jpg"/> I see… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-FutabaChat.jpg"/> It’s OK though. I might not know much about the Nav, but I can still navigate you guys on the path to victory! I’ll guide you to whatever criminal you’re looking for. Mwehehe… You can rely on me! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-RyujiChat.png"/> Awesome, dude! You’re way more reliable than Mona! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> Dammit, Ryuji… You always find the worst possible thing to say! <br/>
<br/>
I feel kind of bad for this fucking cat, constantly getting shit on by Ryuji. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> That’s… well… If what I saw from earlier is true, is it OK for me to stay with the Phantom Thieves…? And even if I’m with the team, I’m useless at the moment… It’s nothing. Well, I’ve gotten pretty used to my life as a cat too. And to be frank, this storage room isn’t bad either. Then again, I can’t wait to turn back to being a human so I can move out. Maybe I’ll live a life of luxury in a suite on the highest floor… …… But rather than becoming some weird thing, maybe staying as a cat isn’t so bad either… You and me made a deal, yeah? That means I can stay here… Isn’t that right? <br/>
