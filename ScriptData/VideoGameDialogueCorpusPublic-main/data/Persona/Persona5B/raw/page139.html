<br/>
SpooOOOoooky Halloween, everyone! The only holiday I don’t refuse to acknowledge because it’s predicated on exploiting feelings of guilt to make you buy shitty cards for your family! <br/>
<br/>
...Moving on!<br/>
<br/>
<b>Anon: waste of tax money imo<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Makoto.png"/> My sister is… serious. Her determination to win this fight is reflected in that casino. She won’t be easy to beat. I know that better than anyone. I want to understand our situation as soon as possible. Let’s go to the Palace today. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Naaaaaaah, I have to make a spookytime costume. Hell if I’m going to figure out how to make a sexy sheet ghost. ...That’s not for me, for the record. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Makoto.png"/> Sorry. Perhaps I AM getting a bit too high strung. But I can’t bear seeing my sister like this. We’ll stop her no matter what. If you’re going by any chance, let me know. I’ll make sure I’m ready at a moment’s notice. <br/>

We don’t actually need any more social stats, so reading is kinda pointless. There’s only three reasons to keep reading: there’s a trophy for reading all of the books in the game (which is pointless for this LP but I may go for anyway if it’s expedient), unlocking the rest of the hangout spots (which is also pointless by this point but also unlocks a trophy), and getting the reward from Jinbocho by reading all the complicated “three session” books. I want to at least show off what the reward is, so we’ll be reading the last of those complicated books.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Morgana.png"/> Would the tactics of the Casanovas in this book still work today? I wonder… <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Girl_6.jpg"/> Ah, don’t say that. I get scared just by thinking they could be lurking nearby… I’ve been writing all over the Phan-Site, asking the Phantom Thieves to give themselves up.<br/>
<br/>
Are yours the comments Mishima keeps deleting? Nah, he’s probably only going after like, egregious threats.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Girl_5.jpg"/> It doesn’t seem like the police will catch them anytime soon. I wish Akechi-kun would save us… <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Chatter.jpg"/> President Okumura died ‘cause of the Phantom Thieves, right…? I heard they’re behind all the weird shit that’s been going on… They tricked us good, huh… Does that guy not watch the news or something? Way to bring the mood down… Dude, why’s he drawing this shit? Is he brave… or just an idiot? Come to think of it, isn’t he notorious? He’s got guts… <br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Guts +1</b>. No, really. It’s pretty great, but it’s one-time, so don’t get any bright ideas. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-MorganaSad.png"/> They’re treating us like villains or something… Damn it… <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Newspaper.jpg"/> They can’t be forgiven if they caused those mental shutdowns. I’ll quote you in my article. I wonder what the truth really is. Discerning what’s true from what’s not is a real challenge… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Newspaper.jpg"/> I personally agree with you, but critics of the Phantom Thieves won’t change their minds easily. I wonder what the truth really is. Discerning what’s true from what’s not is a real challenge… <br/>
<br/>
Well, at least my <s>favorite</s> <s>second-favorite</s> fifth-favorite NPC is on our side. <br/>
<br/>
(For those of you wondering, Yoshida, Sojiro, Foreign Barker, and Drunken Souse are ahead of her. Young Rocker, the religious protesters, and Homeless Man are just below and Fishy Hawker, Starry-eyed Student, and Busy-Looking Young Man are also somewhere on there just through sheer audacity. Hifumi is probably also in the top 10 or so but this game has a lot of good NPCs)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Newspaper.jpg"/> Yeah. We’re not getting all the important info we need since the mass media is unfairly biased.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Girl_4.jpg"/> Um… I’d save it and live off the interest. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Girl_5.jpg"/> That’s boring! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Girl_4.jpg"/> Boring, but practical. Who knows what the new prime minister will do once he’s in office! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Boy_10.jpg"/> I’m certain. Many people can be counted among their victims. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Boy_5.jpg"/> It’ll be so exciting once they get arrested. You think it’ll happen sometime this year? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Boy_10.jpg"/> They announced that they’ve made progress in the investigation. It’s only a matter of time. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Boy_1.jpg"/> It looks like the guys in my team have been studying different diets and workouts, too. It’s like they’ve all changed. Did the Phantom Thieves get to them all or something? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Boy_5.jpg"/> No way, the Phantom Thieves are killers. They’d be dead by now if they were targeted by them. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Boy_8.jpg"/> Maybe the Phantom Thieves bribed him. I didn’t expect him to say they weren’t behind that murder. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Boy_1.jpg"/> I can never understand what these smart people are thinking. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Teacher_1.jpg"/> Yeah, it’s a bit disappointing, but I’m glad nothing bad happened. I just wish those Phantom Thieves would get caught already. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Gaudy_Female_Student.jpg"/> The police are useless. Always telling us what to do, but they can’t catch the Phantom Thieves… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Boy_13.jpg"/> The thing is, this celebrity might actually be a criminal… What should I do? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
PERPETUATE THE LIE THAT IS YOUR EXISTENCE<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Boy_13.jpg"/> But then I-- Um, I mean, my friend, would live each day in fear of being arrested. If the Phantom Thieves had just stayed heroes, I never would have had to deal with all this. Er, you know I was just talking about my friend, right?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-030.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Boy_14.jpg"/> There’s a ton of theories that they’re connected to Shujin somehow. Do you know anything?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Girl_8.jpg"/> I don’t… I don’t want to believe they’re at my school… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Boy_14.jpg"/> Hey, try to look into it while you can. It’ll be too late if you have a psychotic breakdown…<br/>
<br/>
What a fuckin’ hero this dude is. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Haru hangs out on the roof. She said she wanted to get Sojiro’s opinion on her vegetables, so maybe we can form a Confidant and hold an impromptu Halloween party at Leblanc at the same timeB. <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-HaruGym.png"/> Huh? At a time like this…? Is this perhaps part of your grand infiltration strategy? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
She gets really mad at you if you say “I dunno,” heh.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-HaruGym.png"/> *giggle* You make it sound like it’s really important. I suppose relaxation is pretty vital at times like these… In that case, I’d like to use this opportunity to bring my most recent harvest to Sakura-san. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Protag.png"/> <i>This may be a good opportunity to deepen my bond with Haru...</i><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-HaruGym.png"/> I’d like to stop by Leblanc today… Could you join me? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-HaruGym.png"/> Great! Let us go then. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Sojiro.png"/> It’s all good. Not like I have customers to deal with. <br/>
<br/>
How the hell does this place stay in business?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Sojiro.png"/> So… this is what you grew? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Haru.png"/> Yes. I’d like an honest opinion from a culinary professional. <br/>
<br/>
“Culinary professional” is maybe stretching it a bit. He makes coffee and curry. Damn good coffee and curry, but that’s kinda it. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Sojiro.png"/> Let me see… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Wow, Sojiro went right for the throat.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Haru.png"/> I see.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Sojiro.png"/> But, it’s impressive you managed to grow anything at all up on a rooftop of all places. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Haru.png"/> I’m honored to hear you say that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Sojiro.png"/> Y’know… I can’t say it tasted good, but it was actually somewhat refreshing. Kinda like how you feel good after taking bitter medicine.<br/>
<br/>
“Eating your vegetables reminds me of how I feel when I drink cough syrup” is not exactly glowing praise.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Haru.png"/> Hmm… I first came across the plant in my house…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Wait, what!? What the hell are you feeding us!? I mean, it explains how it grew so fast, and on a rooftop of all places, but still! And you found it in your house? Jesus christ, are these veggies <i>haunted?</i> Is the vengeful spirit of Kunikazu Okumura infesting these plants!? Oh god, I ate a ghost!<br/>
<br/>
Well, it’s still better than the last time I got haunted where I just spent four and a half minutes eating an awful pie.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Haru.png"/> Thank you very much for the input, Sakura-san. I’ll take note of that. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-040.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Haru.png"/> ...He’s right. That was the same thought I had. I think I understand what Sakura-san meant when he said they were refreshing. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Haru.png"/> I agree! ...I’m so happy. I didn’t expect this hobby of mine to provide value to the Phantom Thieves. This is actually the only thing I can honestly say I’m good at. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Haru.png"/> But it’s what I want to do. Oh, then… do you think you could help me out again sometime? Like you did today.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Protag.png"/> *nods*<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-046.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Sae.png"/> There’s the possibility you even infiltrated their company building. Perhaps some sort of connection… ...Tell me about this person!<br/>
<br/>
Infiltrated their company building? Not in the real world, no. None of that’s true, in fact. I kind of assumed you were going to ask me about these weird veggies, actually.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The Empress arcana represents concepts like nature, motherhood, femininity, and fertility. When reversed, it signifies dependence. Haru seems like a pretty good fit for most of that. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-049.jpg"/><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Haru can grow vegetables for us, which is a pared-down version of a similar system from Persona 4 Golden. This system is a little half-baked, honestly. The effects are undoubtedly useful, but they fall into the “too good to waste” category where we’ll never use most of them, and it’s so late in the game that we’re unlikely to have too many major difficulties going forward. There’s just not enough time to really take advantage of it. We’ll go into the effects of the vegetables next time we talk to Haru, though.<br/>

We can only grow one vegetable at a time, and the rate depends on the species. Still, a few days is awful fast. Guess it’s that weird Okumura Foods genetic tampering. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-HaruGym.png"/> Let me know if you’d like to grow any vegetables. So, what will it be today? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-HaruGym.png"/> *giggle* That makes me happy. These vegetables should grow nicely here. What do you think? <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The Moonlight Carrot restores all of one ally’s SP, and the Sun Tomato restores 100 SP for everyone. We’ll get more options as we rank Haru up.<br/>

Six days? Time’s kind of at a premium, so that’s a little disappointing. Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-HaruGym.png"/> Hehe. I hope you’re looking forward to it. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-Shinya.png"/> ...She’s one of the bad guys. To be honest, I’ve thought that for a while now. My mom… Do you think they’ll actually be able to change her heart? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-083.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-084.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-Shinya.png"/> So… Someone has to give this to my mom, right? ...OK, I’ll do it. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-085.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Both of these options sound really patronizing to me!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-Shinya.png"/> Well… It IS kind of my fault… that my mom got this way… She had to deal with a lot, raising me on her own… She had to get stronger… ‘cause I was so weak… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-086.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-Shinya.png"/> She fights with everyone, about everything, and ends up getting hurt… At this rate, my mom’s gonna break…<br/>
<br/>
I was initially kind of on the fence about this one because it felt like a rather slight justification to change a heart (even if she was exacerbating Shinya’s bullying) but I feel better about doing this if the rationale is that she’s going to fucking destroy herself if she keeps this up.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-Shinya.png"/> I want my mom to realize that she doesn’t have to be strong for me anymore… But she won’t listen to me when I tell her that… That’s why I wanna help the Phantom Thieves. I wanna stop my mom. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="123-087.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="124-088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-Shinya.png"/> OK, I’ll give her the calling card. She’s my mom, after all. I really want to help her! The next time you see the Phantom Thieves, please tell them I said thank you. And thanks for talking to them about this, Hamiru-san. I’m going to teach you my best, strongest move… <br/>

This upgrade to Bullet Hail causes it to do about 50% of enemies’ max HP in damage, which is great. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="126-090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-Shinya.png"/> Hey, do me a favor… Don’t tell anyone you saw me crying earlier, OK? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Protag.png"/> <i>Interacting with Shinya has made my heart grow… I feel like my <b>Kindness</b> has increased…</i> <br/>

Maaku gains <b>Kindness +3</b>.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="131-Woman_5.jpg"/> “Do you think the Phantom Thieves are innocent?” It’s funny that people make a big deal out of it. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="132-Man_6.jpg"/> Of course they’re not innocent. They’re wanted, so they’d be arrested on the spot. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="133-094.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-TV.jpg"/> The cabinet’s approval ratings hit rock bottom due to how they’ve dealt with the Phantom Thieves. With Representative Shido leading the criticism, many are starting to consider leaving the party. If the ruling party—the Liberal Co-Prosperity Party—splits, a snap Diet election is certain. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="134-MorganaSquint.png"/> They’re having a falling out because of us? I don’t really get politics. <br/>

<br/>
I find these lines so funny for no reason.<br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Charm +3,</b> but it’s a long book so it’s technically +4.<br/>
<br/>
And we’ve finished reading the final Jinbocho book. Time for our reward!
