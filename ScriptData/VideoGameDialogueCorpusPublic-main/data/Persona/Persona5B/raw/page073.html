<br/>
Hm, sounds oddly familiar…<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-AnnSummer.png"/> “Futaba Sakura”…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MakotoSummer.png"/> Wasn’t Sakura...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I honestly love that there isn’t even an option to point this out yourself. It is canon that we don’t remember the last name of Sojiro, who we see literally every day, and it has to be pointed out by Ann and Makoto, who’ve met him three times between the both of them. On my first playthrough, I didn’t remember it either and it blew my fucking mind.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-YusukeBlue.png"/> Does he have any family?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> Does he?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We know <i>nothing</i> about this dude except that he hates deviancy and loves pussy. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-RyujiSummer.png"/> For reals!? How laid-back are you!? Wouldn’t you normally be introduced at least? I mean, you ARE living at his place.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-YusukeBlue.png"/> Well, his situation does make things difficult...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MakotoSummer.png"/> The calling card was delivered to Boss’s house; it’d be more natural to assume this is all related.<br/>
<br/>
This game was overseen by two warring editors with opposing takes on the use of apostrophes after names ending with the letter “s.” <br/>
<br/>
Ha, just kidding, this game’s localization didn’t have an editor.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MakotoSummer.png"/> One of the reasons for that is because Alibaba mentioned nothing about “which” Futaba Sakura. Perhaps he thinks that the name alone is enough.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> That makes sense.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MakotoSummer.png"/> I believe it’s adequate for us to think that this is the doing of someone close by.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-AnnSummer.png"/> I see.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MakotoSummer.png"/> I don’t know how Alibaba got a hold of Maaku-kun’s smartphone information. However, since he’s ordering us through chat, I do feel as though he’s taunting us.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-RyujiSummer.png"/> You mean, this might just be a prank?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MakotoSummer.png"/> I mean, look at his demands. Pay me if you don’t want me to leak who you really are—that I’d understand. But he’s telling us to steal someone’s heart without explaining why.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-YusukeBlue.png"/> So we’re being tested?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MakotoSummer.png"/> Regardless, I think we should ask Boss about Futaba Sakura once.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> That’s probably for the best. There’s nothing else we can do at the moment, and Chief might have an idea on what this is about too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MakotoSummer.png"/> I’ll check the school’s roster just in case.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-YusukeBlue.png"/> We must make sure Boss doesn’t figure out who we are. We’ll have to go about this cautiously.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Could there be a reason as to why that was?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Hm. Alibaba might be our only hope of defeating Medjed. I wish we could get some info about Futaba out of Boss...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-AnnChat.png"/> But trying to force it out would probably have the opposite effect.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-YusukeChat.jpg"/> To be honest, I owe a great deal to both Boss and Maaku. I don’t wish for this to be a source of discord between them.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-RyujiChat.png"/> Yeah, I know just what you mean!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-MakotoChat.jpg"/> It’s probably best to wait for Boss to bring the subject up himself.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-TV.jpg"/> Our show managed to get a “calling card” left by—as it says here--”The Phantom Thieves of Hearts.” On it, they also claim that they will make their target “confess their sins.”<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> Oh, we’ve gotten pretty famous. I guess it’s no surprise that we’re in the public eye now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-RyujiSummer.png"/> Oh yeah, about this Futaba Sakura girl… If she’s related to Boss, think people livin’ nearby would know about her?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> That’s some keen intuition coming from you, Ryuji. You should have made use of that on your exams.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-RyujiSummer.png"/> Ugh, I never wanna think about exams ever again… Anyway, askin’ around in your neighborhood might be the fastest way to figure this shit out. Then again, I doubt it’ll be that easy. It never is...<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> Let’s head to Yongen and gather info around the neighborhood!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
So, here we are in Yongen-Jaya. Our mission: to talk to everyone to discover information about this mysterious “Futaba Sakura.”<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Old_Man.jpg"/> ……It’s the name of my very first love, my teacher back when I was in elementary school!<br/>
<br/>
As you might have guessed, these people aren’t very helpful!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> ...Let’s ask some other people, too.<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Storeowner.jpg"/> A vintage game console… Could I actually sell it if I threw in some games…? I’ m not sure anyone would buy a <b>game console</b> that’s this old, though...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> We can always come back here later. We need to get info on Futaba first.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Neighborhood_Man.jpg"/> No. No, I don’t know who that could be.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Shopper.jpg"/> By the way, do you eat a lot?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Shopper.jpg"/> Well, whenever Boss buys food, it’s enough to feed three people. ...What? You’re telling me you don’t actually eat that much? Maybe it’s Boss who eats a lot then...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Old_Man_2.jpg"/> Hm, but wouldn’t this Futaba get angry if they find out you’re snooping on them though?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Deliveryman.jpg"/> I come to Sakura-san’s often to make deliveries, but I’ve never seen who you’re talking about.<br/>
<br/>
And that’s everyone! What have we learned?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> So, up until now, our biggest lead seems to be… Boss buys a lot of food, far more than enough for one person living alone. Let’s check out all the shops where you can buy food!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-040.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chatter.jpg"/> …… Futaba? Over at Sakura-san’s? I haven’t heard anything… Sorry. Come again!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> I think our only option now is to go home and ask the chief directly...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Sojiro.png"/> So you’re the one who tipped him off about Futaba. You really shouldn’t have done that. I have no intention of talking to you about Wakaba.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Sae.png"/> Tipped off…? What are you talking about? Back to the matter at hand… Your parental authority will have to be suspended. I take it you’re OK with that outcome?<br/>
<br/>
Huh? Parental authority?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Sojiro.png"/> What!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Sae.png"/> Considering the state of your daughter and your family overall, there are no points in your favor. Would you like to take this to domestic court? Our chances of victory are roughly 99.9% though.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Abuse!?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Sojiro.png"/> You’re going that far…!? I told you, I don’t know a damn thing about it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Sae.png"/> We’re extremely serious about this. As long as there’s a possibility that cognitive psience can be linked to psychotic breakdowns…<br/>
<br/>
Nuh-uh, no, that’s not how you spell that. Anyway, Sae glances over at Maaku.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Sojiro.png"/> Tch… Fine… I yield.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Sae puts her card down on the counter.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Sojiro.png"/> I doubt you’ll find anything you want to hear though.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Sae.png"/> That’s fine. It will be up to us to decide whether the information you give us is useful or not.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Sae.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
We have pretty much no idea what’s going on here, but it’s clear that Sae should probably never show her face in Leblanc again. Finishing that conversation with the equivalent of “Toodles!” is just hilariously shitty.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Sojiro.png"/> That woman is real good at pissing people off… ...What’s with that look? You got something to say?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Sojiro.png"/> This doesn’t involve you.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Sojiro.png"/> That’s enough! Just behave yourself and keep going to school if you don’t want me to throw you out of here.<br/>
<br/>
...But tomorrow’s the last day.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Sojiro.png"/> You got that?<br/>
<br/>
Yessir.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Sojiro.png"/> Lock the store up.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> Moreso, our conjecture that Alibaba is connected to Leblanc seems to have a pretty solid foundation. Oh, and didn’t they mention “cognitive” something? ...I wonder what the chief’s hiding. We can’t really press him on the subject though, especially after he mentioned throwing you out.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-TV.jpg"/> Kizuna Fest is happening again this year, and it looks like the demand for tickets is huge. I’m a fan of Kanamin Kitchen myself—maybe that’s why I’ve just been eating meat lately… Hahaha.<br/>
<br/>
Kanamin Kitchen, for those of you who didn’t play Persona 4: Dancing All Night, an actual video game that really exists, is a fast food-themed idol group primarily featuring Kanami Mashita, one of the main characters of that game who was also referenced in Persona 4 as an indirect, offscreen foil to Rise Kujikawa, then on hiatus. Anyway, the “meat” line is about how each of them have a different animal they’re associated with as part of their gimmick. Kanami makes a lot of references to herself as a “prize cow” in that game, for instance, and talks up the quality of her “meat.” It’s about as weird as it sounds.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> Would the chief really do that? It’s gotta be some kind of mistake, right?<br/>
<br/>
Must be.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-RyujiSummer.png"/> What’s up?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MakotoSummer.png"/> It’s nothing. So to summarize what you told us, Futaba is Boss’ daughter, and he’s abusing her? I don’t know him very well… Is he really the kind of person who would do that?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Not a chance. It’s Sojiro. He’s a good gu—well, actually, I don’t know that much about him, and he seems like kind of a dick, but the funny kind, not the unfortunate kind.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MakotoSummer.png"/> I would like to believe so as well, but we don’t have any conclusive evidence, do we…?<br/>

Listen, Makoto, I won’t let the good name of that asshole who hates my guts be besmirched!<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Alibaba.jpg"/> Why aren’t you doing it? I told you I’d help you if you stole her heart. What seems to be the hold up? I also said I’d report your identity to the police if you didn’t help me. Are you OK with that? I’m serious here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-YusukeBlue.png"/> What a selfish person.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MakotoSummer.png"/> Well, he does have information on us…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-RyujiSummer.png"/> Anyways, this Futaba he’s talking about have a Palace? If so, we’ll need keywords to get in. Try messaging him about ‘em.<br/>
<br/>
I don’t think Alibaba will know what that means, Ryuji, considering they already got confused regarding the purpose of the calling card.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Alibaba.jpg"/> Keywords? What are you talking about? Are you just saying random stuff to dodge the issue?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-AnnSummer.png"/> What’re we supposed to do about this?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> We’d be able to figure out Alibaba’s identity if we could just meet with him… Try asking if there’s any way we could meet up.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Alibaba.jpg"/> Meet? With me? That will be difficult. I have reasons for not being able to go out. That’s why I’m contacting you like this.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> He can’t go out?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Alibaba.jpg"/> Wait. I get it. You steal people’s hearts directly… That might make things difficult. Extremely difficult. Hold on. I’m thinking… OK. It’s a shame, but I’m calling this deal off. Stop looking into Futaba Sakura. <br/>
<br/>
Uh, what?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-063.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-064.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-AnnSummer.png"/> Huh…? Did he just shut the whole operation down?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> This doesn’t make any sense… Not only can Alibaba not go out, but he won’t let us meet Futaba either?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-RyujiSummer.png"/> Well, it’s none of our business now. We can’t contact him anymore.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-AnnSummer.png"/> But… what do we do about Medjed? We won’t be able to get Alibaba to help us with them now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-RyujiSummer.png"/> Maybe they were just prankin’ us. They made that huge declaration, but they ain’t done nothing since. I bet we got ‘em freaked out.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> You mean they backed out because they’re afraid we’ll change their hearts?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-RyujiSummer.png"/> Yup. And now it’d just make ‘em look lame if they came out and apologized!<br/>
<br/>
That’s stupid! Why are we pretending this makes any sense, let alone relying on the prospect?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MakotoSummer.png"/> But--<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-RyujiSummer.png"/> I guess with Alibaba and Medjed outta the picture, can we just say this case is closed?<br/>
<br/>
No! Because they’re not, at all!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MakotoSummer.png"/> ...You do have a point. I guess it is safe for us to relax a little.<br/>
<br/>
Makoto! Not you too!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-RyujiSummer.png"/> Oh yeah, remember Kaneshiro’s Treasure? Prepare to have your minds blown! We got one hundred and fifty thousand yen out of it!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-AnnSummer.png"/> That’s awesome! We can really go all out with that kinda money!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-RyujiSummer.png"/> Yeah! Let’s make up for what happened at the fireworks festival! We gotta go eat something fittin’ for the Phantom Thieves’ worldwide debut!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-AnnSummer.png"/> Where would be good…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-RyujiSummer.png"/> Ooh, how ‘bout sushi!? I could really go for some eel too!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-YusukeBlue.png"/> The best method is to fill yourself on ginger before beginning to eat sushi. That is my master technique.<br/>
<br/>
I just realized that the joke here is that he can only afford to eat ginger. Yusuke has like, one joke to his character.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MakotoSummer.png"/> You don’t need to do that this time. Actually, definitely don’t do it, OK?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> I’m all for sushi! You’re OK with that too, right?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> Then it’s decided.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-RyujiSummer.png"/> All right! We’ll go tomorrow night!<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Now that I think about it calmly, it’s strange that they haven’t actually done anything yet. If their goal is to target the Phantom Thieves, they should want to be acting now, given our fame.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-AnnChat.png"/> Huh. When you put it that way, it kinda makes me wonder too. Especially after they taunted us theatrically like that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Yes. However, it would be best for us to come up with a countermeasure regardless.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-RyujiChat.png"/> I was thinking that too! I can’t really put it into words though. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Hm, Yusuke is right. I’m sorry for bringing this up. On the day before our celebration party too…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-AnnChat.png"/> Cheer up, Makoto! We’ll be eating sushi like kings tomorrow!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-YusukeChat.jpg"/> I hope one person in particular is on their best behavior. I’ll refrain from saying who though.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-RyujiChat.png"/> ...You better not be talking about me!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-TV.jpg"/> As of now, no one has stepped forward and identified themselves as part of the Phantom Thieves. With the identities of both sides shrouded in mystery, everyone is watching for what they’ll do next.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> We were starting to get popular. I want us to live up to everyone’s expectations, but these hackers...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-072.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
So, we’re giving up on this whole Medjed/Alibaba/Futaba situation, which is kind of an anticlimax. Except not, because if you actually think it’s ending here, you’re a damn fool.<br/>
<br/>
The characters seem awful ready to ignore what’s happening, and fail to think about several crucial questions, like:<br/>
<ul class="bbc-list">
<li>Who is Alibaba?<br/>
</li><li>What is their connection to Futaba Sakura?<br/>
</li><li>Why haven’t we seen or heard anything about Futaba once in the three and a half months we’ve been staying here?<br/>
</li><li>Is Sojiro abusing her?<br/>
</li><li>Why does she need a change of heart?<br/>
</li><li>Is she even eligible for a change of heart?<br/>
</li><li>What if Medjed hasn’t given up?<br/>
</li><li>Will the sushi be delicious?<br/>
</li></ul>
