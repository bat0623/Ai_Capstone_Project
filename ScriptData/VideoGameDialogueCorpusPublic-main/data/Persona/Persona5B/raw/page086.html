<b>Other man’s voice:</b> Ohhhh! Is there no god in this world?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Morgana.png"/> That bishop guy is too much. He should cut the other guy some slack…<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-YusukeCollarless.png"/> Thank you for today. The time we spent together felt worthwhile. Well then, let’s head home.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chatter.jpg"/> What is Medjed doing?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chatter.jpg"/> It’s hard to tell when they aren’t making any moves…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Murmur.jpg"/> The Phantom Thieves have kept their silence too…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chatter.jpg"/> Is our country gonna be done for when the deadline comes?<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-RyujiChat.png"/> It’s not Medjed, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-MakotoChat.jpg"/> I think they’d make it into a much more theatrical occasion.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-AnnChat.png"/> You’re right! They didn’t make any declarations or anything!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Still… It’s quite a headache.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-RyujiChat.png"/> The hate we’re getting online is insane too. People’re treating us like this is all our fault.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-AnnChat.png"/> I wanna try harder too. We have to do whatever we can.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Either way, simply relying on Futaba will not do.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-RyujiChat.png"/> Well if we run out of options, that might be our only choice…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Are you gonna bug me about that literally every day?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-011.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-012.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MishimaChat.png"/> Right? Wait… Why are you talking about it like you’re not involved? Anyway, let me tell you about the most interesting thing I’ve found so far. Indiscriminate acts of violence in Shibuya. Pretty scary, huh? I can’t find much more than that though… All the posts mention rumors they heard in the underground mall in Shibuya, but nothing else. It’s not super reliable… It’d be good if we could find out more about those rumors, but my presence is limited to the web. You might want to try and learn more on your own if you’re interested.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Morgana.png"/> Hm… I guess we have no choice but to look for details ourselves. I suggest you <b>infiltrate the underground mall as a store employee</b> if you want more info. <br/>
<br/>
You mean… go to my job?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-014.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-TV.jpg"/> It’s actually been quietly becoming a boom? Why don’t YOU try revisiting your childhood?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Chatter.jpg"/> That really takes me back. I used to play in secret so my parents wouldn’t find out. A lot of people find old <b>game consoles</b> at <b>second-hand shops</b> and buy them out of nostalgia.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-MishimaGreen.png"/> *chuckle* As do I, of course. So, you did the request I asked you to do. Thanks! Oh, right! You need to prepare for your next move, right? I’ve been doing the same, actually. Preparing for what, you ask? I could tell you, if you have the time.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
*sigh* Let’s hang out with Mishima.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-MishimaGreen.png"/> You really wanna know, huh? I think you’ll like it! Anyway, let’s head over to the diner! It’s lame just standing around here.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-MishimaGreen.png"/> Actually, I already know! The Phan-Site has been crazy busy thanks to you guys.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Eh, that’s nice Mishi-WHAT<br/>
<br/>
What? What? Why? What? How? What? What? What? Who? What?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-MishimaGreen.png"/> It cost me a lot of money...<br/>
<br/>
Not really what I wanted to know, man.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
None of these options are “WHAT THE FUCK, DUDE.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-MishimaGreen.png"/> Well, yeah! That just goes to show how special it is! I heatrd they had to completely halt production because people kept mistaking it for a real gun. <br/>
<br/>
That’s distressing! But also it seems like that gun would be pretty great in the Metaverse… But also why do you need a fake gun, Mishima?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-MishimaGreen.png"/> It was suggested to me by this military buff from the Phandom. I figured I could use a bit of security, since I’m the sole admin of the whole Phan-Site. I mean, you guys are getting really popular. There’s been a lot more info on the forum lately too… Some of the stuff up there is pretty scary… so it seemed like I might need a little protection.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-MishimaGreen.png"/> This is just for self-defense! I mean, people might come after me if they found out I was working with the Phantom Thieves, right? But as I was saying, we’ve had a pretty massive influx of new posts on the forum lately. One of them seems particularly worthwhile. It’s bigger than anything we’ve done so far… But if we want to really make the Phantom Thieves famous, we’ll need to go after some flashier targets.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Protag.png"/> <i>Mishima seems extra motivated...</i><br/>
<br/>
God, every day with Mishima’s a fuckin’ adventure.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Pretty obviously useful, here.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-MishimaGreen.png"/> By the way, um… do I look any different toy you?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-MishimaGreen.png"/> People keep telling me it seems like I’ve changed recently. I guess I can’t hide my newfound confidence, huh? My true worth will finally--<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Short_Hair.jpg"/> You’re exactly the same as you were back in middle school, Mishima.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Thin_Brow.jpg"/> Yeah. Once a zero, always a zero.<br/>
<br/>
...Not one of you notices the fucking <i>gun</i> on the table?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-MishimaGreen.png"/> Y-Yeah, haha...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Akiyama.jpg"/> You haven’t changed your cell number, have you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-MishimaGreen.png"/> Huh? N-No, I haven’t… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Akiyama.jpg"/> Then why didn’t you come to our hangout? All our ex-classmates were there, y’know! Oh, wait… Nobody even remembered you existed! Can’t invite a guy you can’t remember, right?<br/>

<br/>
Really? Because not only is that not surprising at all, it’s exactly what that looked like.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-MishimaGreen.png"/> But I’ve changed now. I can help you… I’m not going to be that boring guy anymore… …… ...Sorry about that. Anyway, it’s getting late. We should probably head home… See you later.<br/>

Our task today is to investigate that rumor by working at the flower shop.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Flower_Shop.jpg"/> Um…Be careful on your way home. It’s been dangerous in this area lately.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Flower_Shop.jpg"/> Haven’t you heard? There have been quite a few assaults. Just the day before yesterday, a man was hospitalized after getting attacked by someone...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Flower_Shop.jpg"/> Hmm… It’s only a rumor, but I heard it was a famous thug from around here named <b>Taizo Naguri</b>. But… the police can’t handle the situation without any proof. Honestly, I’ve been worried too… I only take the main roads home, even if it takes a bit longer. Maybe the Phantom Thieves could do something about him since the police have their hands tied… …Oh, I almost forgot! Here’s your pay for today.<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Benzo.jpg"/> Yes, well, I’d like to discuss a personal matter. Allow me to be frank. I will be running for my grandfather’s seat in the coming election.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-ToraNoSash.png"/> I see… Congratulations.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Benzo.jpg"/> I held a low-level position in the party’s executive office, but I’m new to candidacy… So I was hoping you could educate me on how to run an election campaign.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Benzo.jpg"/> I’ve heard that you’ve been working harder than anyone these past 20 years.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-ToraNoSash.png"/> Well, I did have a lot of free time after I lost the election. Study is all an amateur can do.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Benzo.jpg"/> Amateur? You’re a veteran, if anything. Besides, you have experience teaching him, right?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Benzo.jpg"/> Your reputation has greatly improved around the executive office recently. And my grandfather has expressed his intent on making peace with you now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-ToraNoSash.png"/> I’d be happy to bury the hatchet with Mr. Kuramoto… But I’m not worthy to join his group again. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Benzo.jpg"/> I thought you would find these conditions favorable… …So I ask that you keep what I’m about to tell you a secret.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Benzo.jpg"/> No, I’d like for your favorite pupil to hear this too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-ToraNoSash.png"/> …? Wait a moment… is your plan to involve him so that I can’t decline?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Benzo.jpg"/> I simply trust his discretion. The Kuramoto group is planning to move forward with a political realignment.<br/>

<br/>
Oh no! Politics!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Benzo.jpg"/> With the government in a weakened state, now’s our chance. As such, I want to emphasize our unity.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-ToraNoSash.png"/> And so you’ve come to me, a former member of the Kuramoto Children… But my views differ from those of the Kuramoto group. And I don’t intend on changing them.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Benzo.jpg"/> I understand. However, you won’t be able to put those beliefs into action if you don’t get elected. ...Hamiru-kun, could you talk some sense into him? You’ll benefit as well.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-ToraNoSash.png"/> Haha, you’re not intimidated, even by the grandson of a big-time Diet member. <i>(to Benzo)</i> ...I appreciate your offer, but I must respectfully decline.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Benzo.jpg"/> So you’re OK with being No-Good Tora forever?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Benzo.jpg"/> Looks like you chose the wrong politician to follow.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-ToraNoSash.png"/> Try to understand that he has his own beliefs.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Benzo.jpg"/> …My apologies. I made a slip of the tongue. And in front of your secretary, no less. I don’t need an answer right away. If you want to show deference to my grandfather… please let me know. I already took care of the bill, so enjoy. Now, if you’ll excuse me...<br/>

I love you, Anime Bernie Sanders.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-ToraNoSash.png"/> I bet when push came to shove, Kuramoto-kun intended to lure you in. He probably didn’t expect me to remain so calm after he showed his trump card. I feel surprisingly at ease whenever you’re with me, like that time with Matsushita. I’m truly indebted to you for all you’ve done for me, but I must ask that you continue to help me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Protag.png"/> <i>I feel like my bond with Yoshida is growing deeper...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-ToraNoSash.png"/> You know, from the way he was acting, I’d swear Kuramoto-kun was hiding something… Ah, my apologies. We’re done eating, so let’s go home.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Protag.png"/> <i>I was able to fend Kuramoto off using only words. I feel like my <b>Charm</b> has increased...</i><br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Charm +3</b>.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-ToraNoSash.png"/> Good work today.<br/>

What the hell is with all these invites<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Truth be told, I found something interesting. It’s a DVD that talks about paintings from around the world. Although I bought it, I don’t have a device to play it on. And even if I did have one, the cicadas are noisy at my dormitory. As such, I’d like to borrow your room. I’ll go to your place tomorrow to hang out, if that’s all right.
