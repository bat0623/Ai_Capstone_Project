<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Haru.png"/> Good morning, Maaku-kun, Mona-chan. The Phantom Thieves are all over the newspapers and television. We’re outlaws now. We have to clear our name, for my father too. So, I’d like to make some progress. Why don’t we go to the Palace today?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I’m too busy fucking around.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Haru.png"/> I’m sorry for rushing you. I’m just worried about Mako-chan. There’s a lot to think about when the target’s someone close to you. Anyway, I hope it goes well. Let’s give this our all. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Chouno.png"/> The Phantom Thieves should target somewhere bigger, more global—not this tiny island country. Like… Oh, I don’t know, the casino city of Las Vegas or something. It was like a dream when I went there… Hehe, I might not look it, but I’m good at card games. The four suits of cards all symbolize something. By the way, Mr. Hamiru. Look at this. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-005.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Aren’t you an English teacher? Why are we talking about this?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Chouno.png"/> Excellent! Yes, the answer is the Holy Grail. The heart was originally drawn as a cup. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Who is “they?”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Chouno.png"/> However, there are cards that belong to no class, in other words, they have no suit. <br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Knowledge +1</b>. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Chouno.png"/> The only card without a suit is the joker. Some theories say it originates from the Fool in tarot decks, but no one knows where it really came from. However, both are trump cards that can bring about unexpected effects. How you use them is critical. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Morgana.png"/> You heard her, Joker. Pretty good name, if I do say so myself. I kinda wish I’d given myself a cooler name… <br/>
<br/>
I don’t even get what “Mona” is supposed to be.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We don’t have the option of hanging out with her normally due to her own Confidant request block, but even if she was available, this Mementos trip for the Hierophant Confidant takes precedence, just like when we needed to recruit her to deliver Shinya’s initial calling card. In either case, we can’t hang out with her until the relevant situation is resolved. The good news, though, is that either situation can be resolved on any afternoon we have free instead of waiting for Futaba to be available. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-FutabaJacket.png"/> Thanks. This is a family issue, so I wanna do it alone with you. Oh, and I sent my uncle an anonymous letter, so the calling card part’s taken care of. <br/>

<br/>
So, we’re going to regret Futaba’s decision to make us come alone here pretty much immediately. Virtually every advantage we have in combat evaporates fighting solo: we have less time to capitalize on the power of buffs, debuffs, and status ailments, have to use our only turn to heal in between attacks, and we just generally have fewer opportunities. <br/>
<br/>
There’s also the fact that this boss is kind of hilariously overtuned. All this adds up to make this fight legitimately one of the most annoying fights in the entire game. The <i>one</i> thing we have going for us is that unlike Girimehkala, the Persona it shares a <s>model</s> form with, it doesn’t have any resistances—so no repelling Physical and Gun. That’s it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-018.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Though given how this thing is capable of depleting 1/3 of Maaku’s health on a <i>bad</i> day in one attack, we’re not really going to be using attacks that are cast from HP.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Once or twice I managed to get a lucky Burn or Shock ailment off an Agilao or a Zionga.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I was unable to capitalize on this because <i>it fucking knows Fast Heal,</i> that skill Haru started with that heals status ailments in half the regular number of turns. That’s not even the biggest fuck you, though:<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
See, I decided to switch to a Persona that’s immune to Physical to see if maybe I could cheese the fight, or at least get some relief. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-023.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Nope! If you do that, it switches to spamming Almighty attacks at you!<br/>
<br/>
(I also in the process of writing this update went back and discovered that he doesn’t switch to Megidola if your equipped Persona is only <i>resistant</i> to Physical instead of immune. I had two Personas that fit this criteria, but unfortunately they’re both relatively weak and had bad skill lineups so I didn’t use them. Whoops!) <br/>
<br/>
(<b>edit:</b> Apparently you can use Physical-immune Personas, just not ones that reflect it. Aw geez, one more mistake immortalized in the LP!)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I eventually managed to win by just spamming attacks, only healing with Beads (full health restores) when I was about to die. It sucked and I wasted some items I’d rather have kept. This is your fault, Futaba! Curse you for not being emotionally ready to tell your friends about the horrific abuse and neglect you suffered at the hands of a relative!<br/>

<br/>
Oh boy, time to learn about what makes this piece of shit tick!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-FutabaOracle.png"/> You were thinking about Mom…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Isshiki.jpg"/> Even back then, I thought just being normal was OK… Then, my whole world changed when I won a lot of money through gambling. Everyone who thought I was worthless started being jealous of me. Haha… I couldn’t forget that feeling… It made me feel like I was smart and confident, like Wakaba! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I like the part of this game where I get to mock the sad backstories.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Isshiki.jpg"/> Ha… Haha… You’re absolutely right… But maybe I’ve realized that too late… Futaba, I’m sorry… Forgive me, Wakaba… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-FutabaOracle.png"/> Uncle… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-028.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-FutabaOracle.png"/> Sojiro’s safe now! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-ProtagJoker.png"/> <i>Youji Isshiki seems to have had a change of heart. I should check on Sojiro…</i><br/>

First, let’s head in for a quick fuse. We need to pick up a matching Persona anyway. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Mild-mannered_Man.jpg"/> Our apologies for coming in so late. We’re investigators from the domestic affairs court. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-041.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Uptight_Woman.jpg"/> Moreover, this report stated that you are abusing your child… Futaba-san. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-FutabaJacket.png"/> N-No… We didn’t make it… Uncle sent his report to the police before we could make him have a change of heart…!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe shut up about that in front of all these people, Futaba. I guess it’s implied she’s whispering?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Mild-mannered_Man.jpg"/> However, the anonymity of the report has led us to question the validity of its content. May we have a word? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Sojiro.png"/> ...Fine by me. I’ve got nothing to hide. Please, take a seat. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Sojiro.png"/> It’s true that Futaba was living as a shut-in, but she overcame that weakness under her own power. And… I would never abuse her. She’s like a daughter to me. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Mild-mannered_Man.jpg"/> And what about the assault claim? His criminal record points to a history of such violence… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Sojiro.png"/> The kid never laid a finger on that guy. He just stood in the way to try and protect Futaba. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Mild-mannered_Man.jpg"/> To be honest, Hamiru-kun, we looked into your current reputation at school… And it seems there have been no issues whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
What? Everyone there thinks I’m a murderer and I got into a suspicious argument with the gym teacher like a week before he got brainwashed. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Mild-mannered_Man.jpg"/> Now then, it’s our job to make sure children like you are safe. How is it… living with Sakura-san? Please, you can speak honestly. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-045.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Uptight_Woman.jpg"/> And what do you think, Futaba-san? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-FutabaJacket.png"/> I… I’m OK. I couldn’t go out for a while… but everyone helped me get better. I’m not afraid anymore.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Awww...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Mild-mannered_Man.jpg"/> ...I see. It’s quite obvious there was no truth to the report we received. I don’t think we’ll need to schedule any additional check-ins for Hamiru-kun either. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Uptight_Woman.jpg"/> …Are you sure about this? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Mild-mannered_Man.jpg"/> They wouldn’t have been able to answer so genuinely if they were trying to trick us. <br/>
<br/>
I mean, you’re right in this case, but you sound like kind of a putz saying shit like this. I’m a very accomplished liar. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Mild-mannered_Man.jpg"/> Besides, meeting them only served to to reaffirm my suspicions… These children are the real victims here. The truth of these things will be clearer to you once you’re a little more experienced.<br/>
<br/>
Cool it on the sexism there, bro! “I guess you’re just too <i>green</i> to see past your <i>emotions</i>.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Mild-mannered_Man.jpg"/> Anyway, thank you for your cooperation, we’ll see ourselves out. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-HaruGym.png"/> Within its gentle care, even a tiny seed can awaken, spread its roots, and grow up towards the sun. It’s almost like a mother. ...Perhaps that aspect is why I find this place so comforting. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-083.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-HaruGym.png"/> I was hesitant at first… but I liked it so much that I kept them long past the original request. I started mixing my own fertilizer, adjusting soil ratios… Now I raise these plants in complete secret. But um, Maaku-kun… I’m worried what the school might do if they found out about this. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-084.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-085.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-HaruGym.png"/> In that case, we can be partners in crime! Honestly, Maaku-kun… I really enjoy the time we spend together. ...It’s so different from how I feel when I’m around him. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-086.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-HaruGym.png"/> Oh, sorry… I meant my fiance. That reminds me though, I wanted to ask your advice about him… This whole arrangement began when my father first introduced us around the beginning of this year. I was told we were just meeting his friend for dinner… but then he said that “friend” was to be my fiance. It was surprising… but I suppose I had always known I would someday be married off for political gain. So… I accepted, and that was the start of our relationship.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-087.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Haru sweats.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-HaruGym.png"/> A-Anyway… I was never exactly fond of him to begin with, but now he has grown far worse. Recently he’s been suggesting we go on an “early honeymoon” together to celebrate our coming marriage. <br/>
<br/>
Now, that’s just hilariously gross!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-HaruGym.png"/> I can’t even stand to look at him though… let alone spend any actual prolonged time together. So, um… what can I say to decline his offer…? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="111-089.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-HaruGym.png"/> As you know, my father passed away before he could fulfill his promise to rescind the marriage proposal. So… any conversation about putting a halt to the marriage will have to come from me. To tell the truth… I’ve already mentioned it to my fiance. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="113-091.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
You go, girl!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-HaruGym.png"/> But he refuses to listen to a single word I have to say. Apparently, he’s even been telling the employees at Okumura Foods about the contract he made with my father… How the company would have to pay extreme reparations if it got called off for any reason… <br/>
<br/>
It seems like the megacorporation could probably afford to hire a decent contract lawyer to make this go away.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-HaruGym.png"/> I just… don’t know how to handle this. I can postpone while I’m still in high school, but after that…? Thinking about it now, it seems my father’s death has turned out to be quite favorable for my fiance. After all, he’s now engaged to the majority shareholder of a massive company… I suppose in the end, all he really cares about is his own personal gain… But that’s not what a relationship is supposed to be built on. It should be something more… Something like… a love so intense that just seeing the other person makes your chest tighten up. Have, um… Have you ever experienced that? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="114-092.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-093.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-HaruGym.png"/> But… there’s no spark like that with my fiance. Spending time with him is almost like some kind of training… Still, any hardship I go through now will surely help the Phantom Thieves eventually. I’ll get through this! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Protag.png"/> <i>I can sense an earnest resolve from Haru...</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="117-095.jpg"/><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="125-Tsuda.jpg"/> Heh, you’re as sharp as ever, Mune. Glad to see you haven’t lost your touch in your absence. I bet we never would’ve gotten duped by those Hong Kong motherfuckers if I still had you as my right-hand man. Instead I’m stuck dealing with the mess that idiot Masa made for me… Hey, kid.

I keep saying this is just a Yakuza game and it keeps going even deeper than I thought.<br/>
