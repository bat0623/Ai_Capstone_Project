Just a little bit of acting. Somehow, the internet found out and hates me now. And the jeers get worse when I explain myself. Perhaps this is a sign. Perhaps I’ll move on from critiquing films to the next stage of my career. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Scathach.jpg"/> I will become a new mask for you and grant discipline to your soul.<br/>
<br/>
Not what we were looking for. In fact, kind of disappointing, considering we already have one of this Persona. Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh, ya think!?<br/>
<br/>
Scathach is the Scottish warrior woman who trains Cu Chulainn in Celtic mythology. While looking this up I discovered that Cu Chulainn <i>fucks</i>. That is all.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is the <i>incredibly</i> rare occurrence of a fusion accident. I say incredibly rare because this is the first time it’s happened to me in two playthroughs. The result Persona, which I believe is chosen from a pool based on the level the original Persona was supposed to have been, does not gain any experience from Arcana Burst but will inherit any skills the original Persona would have.<br/>
<br/>
It’s fine, the Persona we were fusing wasn’t terribly important, it’s just kind of annoying. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Anyway, let’s move on. This Baphomet is three levels above us, so previously we would have been unable to fuse it. But if we try now that we’ve maxed Strength...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Igor.png"/> However, given your circumstance, I may be willing to expressly facilitate your rehabilitation. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
If we pay a fee we can fuse above our level. However, I have <i>no earthly clue</i> what the actual formula is. Based on some GameFAQs posts I dug up it <i>seems</i> like the rule of thumb is a flat ~50k fee to start, increasing by another ~50k for every five levels after that until 20 levels above, when it jumps to ~20k per level. Is this right? Well, immediate testing seems to reveal that it’s not! Fusing one level above gives me a sum of 44k, which is close enough to 50, but going as high as 14 levels above gives me a sum of 99k, which is nowhere near what it should be if that was accurate. It’s possible it’s based on the skills the result Persona knows, but I’m not sure how that works because for three different Personas I got two with the same sum and one with a wildly different one. I think it’s highly likely, though, that it’s also based on how high the result Persona’s level is in the first place. The Japanese wiki I usually consult for information on weird technical data like this is failing me here, so I guess it’ll just be a secret lost to time. <br/>
<br/>
I eventually decide not to fuse it even though I’m fucking rich because I want to save my money and also because I don’t want to blow the game’s difficulty wide open <i>just</i> yet by fusing way above my level. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Anyway, let’s fuse this Byakko from that Scathach we found and Queen Mab!<br/>

<br/>

Aww jeez, the tiger only talks in olden speak.<br/>

<br/>
Byakko is the White Tiger, one of the four symbols of the Chinese Constellation, along with Seiryu (Azure Dragon), Suzaku (Vermillion Bird), and Genbu (Black Tortoise). It represents the west, the season of autumn, and the element of metal.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-FutabaJacket.png"/> She said she wants to go back to school next year, but she might not have the money…<br/>
<br/>
In case this confuses anyone, high school in Japan is not compulsory. You have to pay to go. It’s also why entrance exams are such a huge staple of Japanese media. <br/>
<br/>
While I’m on the subject, it’s a little weird that all the recent Persona games have had school on Saturdays for the protagonists, even if only a half day, as that stopped being mandatory in 2002. Some schools have brought them back to help meet the country’s rigorous education requirements, but it’s kinda weird that it’s just a staple.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-FutabaJacket.png"/> As for me, I… I’m gonna go back. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-FutabaJacket.png"/> And I mean, sure I hated elementary school, but I met Kana-chan there, so… maybe it wasn’t all bad. The same goes for high school. Even if I hate it, I know something positive will come from it. But… I still have to do the last item on my promise list. “Being OK without you around”… Honestly, I’ve been feeling kinda weird lately… My heart’s been beating real fast when we’re together… Then even when we’re apart, I can’t stop thinking about you… <br/>
<br/>
Uh oh.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-FutabaJacket.png"/> I know you’re only being strict ‘cause it’ll help me, but… I just… can’t be OK without you around. Life doesn’t feel the same when you’re not with me. I mean, er… not that, but… I dunno… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-FutabaJacket.png"/> That makes sense for him though. I mean, he’s basically my dad. But you don’t have a reason like that, so… why are you so nice? <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-Mishima.png"/> The Phan-Site’s gone up in flames, so I need to do something, fast. At the very least, I need to make sure the poll is functional again… <br/>
<br/>
Like Yoshida, we can’t hang out with Mishima right now for story reasons. However, we will be able to interact with him again in this case after we take down Shido. He’s not locked off for the rest of the game. <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which, our status as Dead means that, were certain Confidants to be at certain ranks, we could not progress them: Kawakami, Ryuji apparently, and probably Makoto and Futaba too. Really just any event that involves school heavily is a no-go, with one major exception that we’ll get to eventually. One of Futaba’s previous ranks involved her going to Shujin, which I’m assuming is an obvious no-go. I also assume that we can’t do any of Makoto’s ranks that take place in the student council room. I have been told that someone did get locked out of progressing Ryuji, which is probably due to his Rank 8, which takes place at school and has you interacting with the former track team. Finally, there are multiple mandatory scenes for Kawakami in between ranks that must be seen to progress her Confidant, all of which take place at school. The scene with the Takases after Rank 8 and the scene in class where her will to teach is reinvigorated after Rank 9 have to be seen to move on to the next rank, so you’re screwed if you haven’t seen them yet by now.<br/>
<br/>
Also, to answer my question last update about how you contact Ryuji or Makoto since they hang out at school: Ryuji goes to his “day off” hangout spot, the Shibuya arcade, while trying to interact with Makoto results in the two of you meeting by the subway platform.<br/>

Morgana just calling this dude a loser, wow.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="111-YusukeJacket.png"/> Thank you. I would like to enter Mementos again today. I believe that place holds the truth of the human heart. <br/>

Oh, joy. Mementos.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-YusukeFox.png"/> It is ugly… yet beautiful as well. That duality is what makes humanity such an interesting subject… As you know, I have been confused recently about the reason for my art. Did I want to be recognized, or did I want to capture true beauty? Was it due to my talent, or just my upbringing? ...Each answer would seem correct at first, yet only prove itself false upon a more in-depth examination. Maaku… When my mother was painting the “Sayuri”… what do you think she was thinking about? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="118-086.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-087.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-YusukeFox.png"/> But you are probably right. However, I believe that was not the only thing she thought about. “It seems the “Sayuri” was meant to impart something with me… and all others who view it, for that matter. Love, regret, loneliness, anxiety, calm… and hope. All of the emotions my mother felt, conveyed plainly to the viewer. That is why it has such a profoundly unique impact on those who see it.<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-089.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-YusukeFox.png"/> And yet… that painting has kept me going this whole time. During particularly difficult nights, it was there to soothe my sadness. It acted almost as a ray of light cutting through the somber darkness… I had wanted to create a similar beacon of hope for others… but it seems I lost sight of that goal. Look. This world is a dark, unrelenting place, Maaku. But that is why I am going to wield my brush again… To give hope to all those who see my paintings. <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="123-091.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-YusukeFox.png"/> Now, I will use my art to paint over the blackness of this world. It shall become a vivid realm, full of hope… I expect it will be a most beautiful sight to behold. Perhaps you will see it someday, Maaku… <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-YusukeFox.png"/> Hm, this radiant light growing within me… It must be the light of hope. ...I shall paint it.<br/>
<br/>
It seems Yusuke has discovered his <i>raison d'être.</i> How nice.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="128-Art_Patron.jpg"/> On your way home? You clearly have time on your hands, Yusuke-kun. I’m on my way now to prepare for the competition. Speaking of which, do you plan on entering? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="111-YusukeJacket.png"/> Indeed I do. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="128-Art_Patron.jpg"/> Your pride may not be too pleased with the outcome. After all, the winner’s spot is not simply yours for the taking. I suppose whether you ultimately opt to enter is entirely your decision though. The more the merrier, yes? Hahaha!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it’s just the fact that we haven’t hung out with poor Yusuke in quite some time, but was “inability to accept defeat” really one of his defining hangups?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="129-095.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="111-YusukeJacket.png"/> That no longer matters to me though. I am going to enter my painting merely so others can be exposed to it. Well, I will talk to you later, Maaku. Farewell. <br/>
