<br/>
So, we start off this update immediately bumrushed by Shadows and caught in an ambush because you’re not ready for a fight immediately after that cutscene with the camera facing the wrong direction! Also, it’s a double fight, because fuck you.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ryuji learns Maziodyne to replace Mazionga.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Futaba also learns Subrecover SP EX, which automatically replaces Subrecover SP. Now backup party members will have their SP restored by 3% instead of 1%.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we continue.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-YusukeFox.png"/> Destruction is… pleasing? She cannot be in her right mind. It is as though she wishes for the world to end… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This is Chernobog. It is weak to Bless and Fire, uses a bunch of different Physical moves, and can cast Mudoon. It also drains Curse and Ice and blocks Electricity.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This is Baal. It drains and uses Wind, as well as Physical, Matarukaja, and Charge.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chatter.jpg"/> I heard there were some others who escaped this place, but they found their way back recently… Wouldn’t it be better if people just lived with the hand they’ve been dealt? How hilarious… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-RyujiSkull.png"/> Is she talkin’ about Kamoshida and all the others…? I dunno how to put this… but I’m thinkin’ these people’re more human than the ones in reality… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chatter.jpg"/> And besides… it’s going to be happening soon…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-FutabaOracle.png"/> So he just wants to see the world from online, huh…? I know how that might feel, but it gets old after a while. I can speak from experience… And besides that, what’s “happening soon”?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chatter.jpg"/> So, why don’t you guys come join us? The world’s going to end soon anyway, so you might as well…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruNoir.png"/> When did these people begin to think this prison is a comfortable place to live…? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ann learns Fire Amp to replace Evade Ice.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Haru also learns Cripple (50% damage boost to Gun attacks, stacks with Snipe) to replace Amrita Shower. Amrita Shower is plenty useful, but here in the endgame we’re generally going to want Maaku to be taking care of ailment relief.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We finally come to our first safe room. This dungeon isn’t terribly long in comparison to the others, but the safe rooms are still spread very thin.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-YusukeFox.png"/> Even though this is the cognitive world, I find it hard to believe this is underneath Shibuya… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruNoir.png"/> It’s known as a city of freedom, both in fun and in fashion… <br/>
<br/>
“Freedom” is certainly a way to describe the fashion of TWEWY, sure.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-MakotoQueen.png"/> Yes, it’s a brilliant place. The crosswalk in front of the station is internationally-known nowadays. And yet, people seem to somehow consider it a prison for them… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-AnnPanther.png"/> A city of freedom… Is that really true? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Morgana.png"/> What do you mean? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-AnnPanther.png"/> Like, all Shibuya really is to me is a congested station where changing stops is frustrating… Are the people here really free…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-RyujiSkull.png"/> That aside, how far you think we’re at now, Mona?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MorganaSad.png"/> O-Oh, let’s see… Maybe halfway…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-MakotoQueen.png"/> Hm, we’ve come pretty far. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MorganaSad.png"/> But wait… The Treasure feels a lot closer than it ever has before… What’s going on here…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-YusukeFox.png"/> We did pass through Mementos to get here. It may make sense if we take that fact into consideration.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-RyujiSkull.png"/> Welp, we just got another half to go! Let’s get fired up and do this! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The saferoom itself is at a minor fork in the road. We head north and immediately come across another device.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-016.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Puzzle_1.png"/><br/>
<br/>
Looks simple enough. Start on A2, south to B2, east to B3, south through C3 and D3, west through D2 and D1, north through C1 and B1, east again to B2, and north to A2.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Puzzle_1_A.png"/><br/>
<br/>
Uhh, hold on a second. South… West… East… Argh, no!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, Makoto’s here to inform us we’re boned.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-RyujiSkull.png"/> Huh? Whaddya mean?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-MakotoQueen.png"/> Given the room’s shape and number of spots, there’s no mathematical way we can make it all blue.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruNoir.png"/> Then, what do we do…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-MakotoQueen.png"/> I’m not sure… but if this is really a security system, there has to be a way past it.<br/>
<br/>
Makoto doesn’t seem to understand what the purpose of a security system is.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-MakotoQueen.png"/> We may want to try checking elsewhere for the time being. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
On our way out of this area, we spot this weird indentation. I forget to examine it, but you’ve played enough JRPGs to know that we have to put some manner of doohickey in there.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We head south at the fork this time. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-020.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruNoir.png"/> There’s something shining back there… What could it be?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-YusukeFox.png"/> Either way, if it is worth being protected, it should be safe to assume that it’s of value to us. What do you think, Joker? Shall we defeat it and take whatever it is protecting? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-YusukeFox.png"/> Understood! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-023.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Mementos_Warden.jpg"/> Hmph, I won’t deny that you’ll need it to continue onward. But mark my words, you’ll never get your hands on it. After all, you’ll have to go through me to do so! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Aaaaaaaagh.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This guy’s weak to Psy and Nuke and drains Physical, Gun, and Curse. He uses powerful Physical attacks exclusively.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
He doesn’t put up much of a fight, though.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-MakotoQueen.png"/> Hm… What do you think this could be used for…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-RyujiSkull.png"/> Who knows? It’ll prolly come in handy though. I mean, that strong-ass Shadow was guardin’ it. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chatter.jpg"/> I’ve heard there’s a place reserved for the most terribly evil people of them all… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-FutabaOracle.png"/> ...Do you think that could be the Quarantine Cell we heard about? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chatter.jpg"/> Here, any wish can become reality… and isn’t that all anyone wants out of life? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-MorganaAngry.png"/> These people really think their wishes are going to come true…? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-032.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-033.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The platform lowers.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Now, let’s try this again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Puzzle_1_B.png"/><br/>
<br/>
South to B2, east to B3, south to C3, west to C2, east to C3, south to D3, west to D2 and D1, north to C1 and B1, east to B2 and B3, south to C3, north to B3, west to B2, and finally north to return to A2.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Simple.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Another one of these massive spirals downward, eh?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-MakotoQueen.png"/> We’re so far underground at this point… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-YusukeFox.png"/> I hope we don’t suddenly find ourselves in a giant pool of lava… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-RyujiSkull.png"/> Still, we gotta keep going…! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-039.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-040.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And one more cutscene room.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruNoir.png"/> Doesn’t that cell seem… different from the others? <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-YusukeFox.png"/> Supposedly, the most sinful, most dangerous inmate is held within… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Morgana.png"/> This place smells familiar for some reason…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruNoir.png"/> Mona-chan…? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-MorganaAngry.png"/> This is it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-046.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>What!?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruNoir.png"/> Born…? Inside the prison? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-AnnPanther.png"/> Wait, then are YOU the dangerous inmate!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-MorganaAngry.png"/> No… the inmate wasn’t me… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Morgana.png"/> Someone created me here… To guide all of you… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruNoir.png"/> Guide…? And who is this someone…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MorganaSad.png"/> Ngh… I can’t remember… Damn it… I’m so close… but my memory is too foggy… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-RyujiSkull.png"/> Y’know, hearin’ all this just makes me wanna know what’s inside. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Mementos_Shadow.jpg"/> Alert! Alert! Capture them at once!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-050.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And the game throws you into an automatic ambush. Bullshit. <br/>
<br/>
The dragon dude uses Fire and Physical (which he can Charge), and the Nebiroses are near-identical to their regular Shadow forms. The only hurdle here is the fact that they get to act first.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-YusukeFox.png"/> Given how important this cell appears to be, the depths of Mementos must be near. Mona’s memories may return if we continue on… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MorganaSad.png"/> Yeah… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-RyujiSkull.png"/> So, we’re finally gettin’ close to the public’s Treasure, huh? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MorganaSad.png"/> Now that I think about it, it makes sense that Mementos would connect to some place like underneath Shibuya. Everyone crams themselves into packed underground boxes day after day without any complaints… From my standpoint, those are the true inmates of Mementos. It’s no surprise the places are connected.<br/>
<br/>
Really makes u think<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-MakotoQueen.png"/> You know, the voices of the public may have led the Phantom Thieves on more than any criminal…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-RyujiSkull.png"/> Seriously! Let’s hurry up and steal that Treasure so we can crush Mementos!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruNoir.png"/> We truly are reforming society… Let’s go!<br/>
<br/>
Everyone nods.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I guess we’re just leaving the Quarantine Cell behind, then? No way that could possibly be important.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This is Thor. He’s weak to Psy, drains Electricity, and uses powerful Physical and Electric skills. He can also use Tarukaja and Charge, and he has Shock Boost and Elec Amp.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yusuke replaces Kamu Susano-o’s Heat Wave with Vorpal Blade, which deals Severe Physical to all enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Morgana learns Wind Amp. I replaced Masukunda with it, but immediately realized that I fucked up and actually wanted to get rid of Samarecarm, oops. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The guy on the right is Belial. It’s pretty much identical to its “boss” form, in that it has no resistances outside of blocking Curse and uses Maragidyne, Myriad Slashes, and Charge exclusively.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chatter.jpg"/> The only reason you can act so grand is that you live in a safe zone, devoid of possible failure. How does it feel to hear the truth? Are you relieved to know you’ve been fooling yourselves? Now what I really can’t understand is what you call “happiness.” But whatever, I guess. Everyone has their own way to reach it. Either way, stop trying to tell us what to do. This is how we can attain true happiness. I don’t care what you guys think of it. We have no reason to listen to your complaints!<br/>
<br/>
Jesus christ, we get it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-YusukeFox.png"/> Hm… If you truly believe all of that, then you are free to do as you wish. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chatter.jpg"/> It was a fun joke while it lasted, but it’s old news now. Tell me something a little more exciting. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-RyujiSkull.png"/> A joke!? Bullshit! Y’know people have actually died from those mental shutdowns, right!? You ever thought of that!? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chatter.jpg"/> I’d rather use that time for myself before it’s too late… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-MakotoQueen.png"/> There’s no such thing as “time for yourself” in a prison cell. Why are they acting like this…? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-YusukeFox.png"/> How can one who cannot open their eyes be a judge of beauty…? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Another device here. It’s hard to tell in this image, but the platform we’re currently walking on is transparent. This doesn’t actually effect anything in the upcoming puzzle, and it might as well just be a blank tile. I will mark it red in the diagram.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-063.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-064.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Hm… as we step on more tiles, the lights on them darken.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-Puzzle_2.png"/><br/>
<br/>
Still, nothing to worry about. East through A2 and A3, south through B3 and C3, west through C2 and C1, north through B1 and back to A1. Finished.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-MakotoQueen.png"/> But what could those patterns on the floor have meant…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-FutabaOracle.png"/> I’m pretty sure I figured it out while I was watching… There was a limitation on this area. You could only change the colors up to ten times. Any more than that and we’d have had to start over. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-AnnPanther.png"/> You solved a puzzle like that on your first try, Joker…? That’s seriously incredible!<br/>
<br/>
Eh, not really. As long as you don’t double back you can’t fuck this one up.<br/>
<br/>
But Futaba’s correct. Stepping on an eleventh tile will deactivate the whole thing and you’ll have to try again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chatter.jpg"/> And my dreams…? I just have to deal with never seeing them come true. It’s a cruel fact of life. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-YusukeFox.png"/> “Reality is ending”? That is similar to what the others in the prison are saying… What could that mean? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-068.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Up ahead, we come across another barrier and another device. We obviously can’t solve this one yet due to the presence of the barrier, but here’s what it would have looked like: <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Puzzle_3.png"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-YusukeFox.png"/> My apologies, but we did not come here seeking approval. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Another device.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-072.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-Puzzle_4.png"/><br/>
<br/>
West from the start at A2 to A1, south to B1, east from there all the way to B5, north to A5, south to B5, north to A5 again, and west three to return to A2.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-073.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And our reward is another thingamajig.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-075.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-076.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Put it in the slot… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-077.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and activate the device.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There are a couple of ways to do this one, but I did a figure-eight: east from the start at A2 to A3, south to C3, west to C2, north through B2 to A2, west to A1, south to C1, and east to C2, whereupon we use B2 again to reach A2. Please note that the diagram and these instructions are relative to the default camera position when you start the puzzle, not the map. I actually had to go back and remake some of my diagrams because they were inconsistent about this.<br/>

<br/>
Further in, we come across Yamata-no-Orochi. It is weak to Nuke, blocks Ice, and uses Mabufudyne and Oni-Kagura (Medium Physical to the party with a chance of Rage).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Aaaaaaaaaaaaand this is a visit from your IT department, also known as Mara. It blocks Gun, drains Fire, and reflects Curse. It also uses Fire, Curse, Physical, and Almighty.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chatter.jpg"/> It won’t matter soon enough anyway…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-MorganaSad.png"/> I see… She doesn’t realize what being governed by someone really means… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-081.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chatter.jpg"/> Just let me see out the end of this world in peace… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-MakotoQueen.png"/> I’m curious as to why everyone believes the world is coming to an end… What could they mean…?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-082.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Another puzzle up ahead.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-083.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Puzzle_5.png"/><br/>
<br/>
Let’s try this one. West from the start at A3 to A1, south all the way to D1, east to D2, north to C2. Then, west to C1, north to B1, and north to A1… and we’re out of moves.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-084.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-YusukeFox.png"/> Are you certain about that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-MakotoQueen.png"/> Absolutely. Taking the shape and number of spots into account, no route could complete that quick. Having said that, there seems to be another device in this room. Why don’t we try that first?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there are actually three devices in this room. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-085.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We’ll start with the third one, all the way to the east (because that’s the one we need to do first).<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-086.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-Puzzle_6.png"/><br/>
<br/>
Start at A2, west to A1, east to A3, south to B3, north to A3, west to A2, east to A3, west back to A2. Easy peasy, and with two moves left.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-087.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The device’s platform lowers, allowing us to complete the next puzzle in the sequence.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-088.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-089.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-Puzzle_7.png"/><br/>
<br/>
The platform that lowered was C2. We start at A3, west to A1, south to C1, east to C3, north to A3. Bing badda boom.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="111-090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And now the obstruction that prevented us from finishing that first puzzle is gone.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-091.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
One more time, shall we?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="113-Puzzle_5_A.png"/><br/>
<br/>
Start at A3, west to A1, south to D1, east to D2, north all the way to A2, south to B2, north to A2, east back to A3. Ten moves.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="114-092.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-AnnPanther.png"/> About time… Now we can keep moving forward! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruNoir.png"/> Nicely done, Joker! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-093.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And we finally come across another safe room, which means we’re at the end of Mementos Depths. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-capture_252_26122018_152635.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruNoir.png"/> It seems we’ve made it quite far… What are your thoughts, Mona-chan? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-MorganaAngry.png"/> We’re almost to the Treasure… Its presence is really close now… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-YusukeFox.png"/> So the time has finally arrived… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-RyujiSkull.png"/> Yup, this is seriously it. Let’s take the public’s Treasure, you guys! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-AnnPanther.png"/> But… what’s going to happen once we actually take it? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-MakotoQueen.png"/> I doubt that alone will be enough to make everything right. Still, it is worth going through with… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruNoir.png"/> Mm-hm. I’m sure that everyone’s hearts will change somehow. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-FutabaOracle.png"/> It’d be super weird if people all over the city just started crying and apologizing for stuff though! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-YusukeFox.png"/> Well, results are yet unknown, but we have come this far… We must continue onward. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="117-capture_253_26122018_152644.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-RyujiSkull.png"/> Hell yeah! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-MorganaAngry.png"/> The word failure’s not in my dictionary! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-AnnPanther.png"/> This is the end! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-YusukeFox.png"/> The labor we have put in up to this point shall finally come to fruition! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-MakotoQueen.png"/> That’s right!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-FutabaOracle.png"/> I’m here too, so you guys don’t gotta worry about anything! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruNoir.png"/> Let’s bring all of our hard work to a triumphant close! <br/>
<br/>
Before we continue, let’s do some last-minute fusin’.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="118-094.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
First, Cybele from Yamata-no-Orochi and Baal. We have to pay 94900 yen to fuse above our level, though.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-095.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-Cybele.jpg"/> I’ll hunt you down and skin you if you dare cheat on me. I’m your mask now… You better be ready.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-096.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Cybele is the Phrygian mother goddess of the earth, who is also associated with wildlife (lions in particular) and vegetation. She was a protector of several city-states, including Athens. According to her in-game description, she took Attis, her priest, as a lover, but he was driven insane when he was forced to marry another.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-097.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Also on the docket for today, Siegfried from Thor and Byakko.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="123-098.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="124-Siegfried.jpg"/> Your soul shall act as a tool to transform my dauntless might into an unstoppable mask.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="125-099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Siegfried is the German name of the hero from the epic poem “Das Nibelungenlied.” His original Norse name was Sigurd. He slayed the dragon Fafnir, and bathed in his blood to make himself invincible. However, a leaf that had stuck to his shoulder gave him a weak spot.<br/>
<br/>
Now, let’s head back down and make our approach towards whatever lies at the heart of Mementos.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="126-100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chatter.jpg"/> I feel sick just thinking about it. All I can really do now is ignore it, I suppose.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-RyujiSkull.png"/> What a load of shit… Hey! The world’s not gonna get better on its own, y’know! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="127-101.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chatter.jpg"/> I might lose the one place I belong if I put myself out there… I’m afraid of that happening, so I think I’ll just stay as I am… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-AnnPanther.png"/> Uh, your current situation should be what’s scaring you! How’s he OK with all of this…? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="128-102.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Only one way forward now. What’s that ahead of us…?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="129-103.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-MakotoQueen.png"/> It’s so big… I can’t believe there’s such a giant thing all the way down here… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruNoir.png"/> Is everyone’s Treasure inside?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-MorganaAngry.png"/> Yeah… That should be the case. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-YusukeFox.png"/> But this bizarrely ominous air about it… It could be likened to a temple of sorts… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-RyujiSkull.png"/> Th-There’s no point freakin’ out now! C’mon, let’s go!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="130-104.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="131-105.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="132-106.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And so we descend into the belly of the beast…
