<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Ushimaru.png"/> It’d spell the end of this country if kids started wanting to become more like the Phantom Thieves. You’re already in your second year of high school. You should have a clear vision of your future. If you’re looking for safety and stability, a civil servant is a good option. Hey, Hamiru. Not all civil servants work in government offices. Which of these occupations is a civil one. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Uhhhhhhhhh…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Ushimaru.png"/> Oho… I’m impressed you knew that. Only the cormorant fishermen of Nagaragawa are officially used by the imperial household. <br/>
<br/>
“Cormorant” fishing? According to my incredible internet proficiency, I have discovered that a cormorant is a type of bird, trained by Asian fishermen to catch fish for them. That’s rather quaint.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Ushimaru.png"/> Those fishermen are granted spots on the Imperial Household Agency’s Board of Ceremonies. That said, you can’t break into that industry even if you wanted to since it’s a hereditary occupation. If you want a government job, try for a spot in the Diet—though some may say that’s hereditary too.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Morgana.png"/> Oh yeah, they said on the news that the cabinet’s approval rating went down again. They’re the complete opposite of us. Our popularity and approval have been going through the roof. <br/>
<br/>
And there’s no way it could ever stop...<br/>

<br/>
This sounds like a problem!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Shinya.png"/> ...It’s a war. I’m on the defensive right now, but I’m looking for a chance to counterattack. I could finish them in a second if I put my mind to it. It’s just that… now’s not the right time. It gets kind of annoying having to watch my back all the time, though… Maybe I can ask the Phantom Thieves to take care of them… <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Woman_5.jpg"/> Of course not. You did your best, and that’s all that counts. Now, no more crying. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Shinya.png"/> That’s what my mom told me. My mom’s fighting with the school… About how classes are taught, the way teachers treat students, the size of the classes… Since the divorce, my mom’s been taking care of me all by herself. She says it’s exhausting.<br/>
<br/>
That’s a weird thing to say! I mean, it’s true, child care is exhausting and expensive, but it’s weird to put that on the kid.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Shinya.png"/> She leaves really early to go to work. Then she comes home really late to take care of me. It’s no wonder she demands so much from the school, you know? But all my classmates make fun of her and call her a complainer… When I tell them to stop, they call me a momma’s boy… That’s how the war started. My mom gets made fun of because I’m weak! That’s why I gotta get stronger!<br/>
<br/>
Shinya seems happy with her though.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-022.jpg"/><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Shinya.png"/> But I’ve got a long way to go… Oh, before I forget, I need to show you something… Don’t tell anyone else about this, OK? But I’m going to show you a guaranteed way to win!<br/>

Warning Shot lets us potentially skip the negotiation process by firing a… warning shot. It apparently works a very, very high percentage of the time. I never got Shinya past Rank 2 in my original file, so everything from here on is uncharted territory, and let me just say that this Confidant gets us some amazing shit. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Shinya.png"/> ..I wish I could be a member of the Phantom Thieves and help them defeat the bad guys in the world. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Oh no! I accidentally did an INFORMATION CRIME!<br/>
<br/>
No, but seriously, I’m cracking up at how stiff that reads. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-TV.jpg"/> Consider the following… A: Divulging someone’s crimes/B: Insult in an internet post/ Which of these counts as slander? You be the judge! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-TV.jpg"/> The correct answer is...A! Spreading around someone’s criminal history… is a crime! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chatter.jpg"/> If you publicly say something that hurts someone’s reputation, even if it’s true, it’s slander! Insults are usually not considered defamation, and even if it was, it’d be libel on the internet. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Morgana.png"/> Oh, you got it right. So everyone who spreads rumors about you is guilty of slander, eh? <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Wait, Lala actually gave it to Maaku!?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Ohya.png"/> Thanks to my quota… and that shithead chief. But I made some progress on my personal investigation. I did some research on the Phantom Thieves. I’m starting to get the impression they might actually be the real deal. No signs of an internal power struggle, no dirty money changing hands…<br/>
<br/>
Well, we just had an internal power struggle like two weeks back, and a lot of our revenue is technically from counterfeiting, so...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Ohya.png"/> I can kinda understand now how someone like you became a fan. The more I get to know about the Phantom Thieves, the better I understand them… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Ohya.png"/> I can relate to their sincerity. They remind me of how I used to be. I already know firsthand that fighting the evils of society is a never-ending, thankless job… But I still do it nonetheless. I bet the Phantom Thieves share that same type of passion. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> *giggle* I never thought I’d hear you talking about passion, Ichiko-chan. Maybe all this talk about the Phantom Thieves has influenced you. Or maybe it’s just the kid. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Ohya.png"/> Maybe… I mean, he is a pretty big fan of theirs, so… <br/>

I can’t just give up now! <br/>

<br/>
And we can rank up Shinya next time. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> Meanwhile, I am here to observe the public in an attempt to refresh my mind. Do you need something? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Let’s hang with Yusuke. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> *chuckle* You must have a wealth of free time if that is your decision. Do you remember Director Kawanabe of the Japanese Art Support Foundation? ...The man who offered his support to me at Madarame’s house.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yes! The time we broke into a place and then he broke in after us! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> I would like your assistance with him. Do you have time to spare? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> You are truly kind. I find it quite suspicious that he would offer money to a mere high school student like myself… I am grateful for his offer… but I am unsure of what to do. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> ...Indeed. I must cling onto any semblance of hope I can find in this world… <br/>
<br/>
Geez, you’re a downer.<br/>
<br/> 
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> Very well. I will call him. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> …I would appreciate it if you could join me, Maaku. Your presence could help ease my societal discomfort, as well as diffuse the temptation of money. Furthermore, your composure will allow you to tell if he is truly attempting to scam me. Kawanabe-san is waiting for us at the sushi bar. I already told him that you will be coming, so let us go. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We’d better eat up before the sushi gets cold.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> Before that… there is something I would like to ask. ...Just who are you? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Art_Patron.jpg"/> Hm… An interesting question. My work involves gallery management, but my hobbies are diverse. The foundation is but one of those hobbies. Broadly speaking, we’re responsible for scouting and nurturing talented youth involved in the art world. We offer free scholarships, mediate study abroad programs… and we also connect young artists to customers. ...At a time, even Madarame participated in our organization. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> Sensei… I-I mean, Madarame? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Art_Patron.jpg"/> Indeed. A good many benefited from his time working with us. We were aware of the dark rumors about him… but we could never have seen his confession coming. I suppose it’s likely he was deceiving us that whole time… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> ...This is all because of him. It is his fault I can no longer view paintings with a pure heart…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Art_Patron.jpg"/> Hm…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> In the past, simply the desire to paint led me to seek beauty. But now, I find myself constantly weighed down by the search for awards or the praise of others… An ugly attachment has fastened itself upon my work… I can no longer paint how I used to. My art… is tainted. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Art_Patron.jpg"/> ...I see. However, it would be wasteful to let your talent dry up. Our foundation would gladly support you. Not only a former student of the infamous Madarame, but someone with those looks… There is definitely a market for you. We’ll sell you as the “tragic, handsome artist.” <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-072.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Music:</b> <a href="https://clyp.it/xgygzltf?token=453ba8f05314d2b84945c0acae73d4f5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Suspicion</a><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Art_Patron.jpg"/> Exactly as it sounds. Having your ideas stolen by Madarame, losing a place to live, hungry for food… That unstable air about you makes for the perfect tragedy. A story like yours will sell even to those who don’t understand art. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> A story…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Art_Patron.jpg"/> If you don’t have one in the modern climate, nobody will even mention your name. ...Don’t worry, we’ll handle the details. But in return, you must sell your work through my gallery. We will take a mediation fee, but you’ll be granted steady revenue and a nice customer base as well.<br/>
<br/>
This seems sketchy, but I wonder how much of that’s just the track literally named “Suspicion” playing in the background. When you think about it, most of it’s really rather benign. Oh no! They’re going to promote him and his work in exchange for… a fee!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-074.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> In the end, this is only about money! That which taints pure beauty… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Art_Patron.jpg"/> How immature…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> Excuse me!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Art_Patron.jpg"/> It seems you haven’t learned anything after all. You’re not looking at reality objectively. Is wealth really that horrible?<br/>
<br/>
Well, yes, but whatever.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Art_Patron.jpg"/> And beyond that, how long will you continue to chase those illusions of yours? Purity… Art…<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I see the issue here. This dude doesn’t believe in <i>~the power of art~</i>. It’s just a means to an end for him. For shame. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> Sh-Shut your mouth! I reject your offer! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Art_Patron.jpg"/> Hmph… I thought you of all people would have the resolve to use art to make a living. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> I have that resolve! However, I also believe such a life should only come via proper assessment! <br/>
<br/>
This is a really fancy way of saying “he thinks that you should have to think really hard about shit before you have money” or something, I dunno, I thought I understood.<br/>
<br/>
It probably actually just means that he should understand art or money or both before he tries to use art to <i>make</i> money, it’s just not phrased well.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Art_Patron.jpg"/> Hm? In that case, I have an opportunity for you. My foundation will soon be holding a competition for young artists from around the nation. The prize shall be our support. We’ll bring customers from around Japan to see the next great talent. ...There will be a great deal of pressure on you, should you enter. Or perhaps… are you too afraid?<br/>
<br/>
“I’m a 65-year-old man calling you a chicken! What are you gonna do about it, art-boy?”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> What did you say…!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Art_Patron.jpg"/> I wonder if you have what it takes to withstand a skill-based assessment of that magnitude. ...I look forward to finding out. Now then, it seems there’s no use in any further discussion. You can have them send the bill to my office. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-076.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> Why is it that all artists talk about is money, money, money!? Has the true meaning of art been lost!? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-077.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Look man, I got 500k on me <i>right now</i>. Maybe I ain’t the best person to talk to about this. I’m just telling you what you want to hear at this point, money’s fuckin’ great!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-078.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> You are correct… My passion can change the world. However… I would starve to death without money. Passion alone may fill my heart, but it cannot fill my stomach… What a troubling predicament… Anyhow, I am quite glad that you chose to accompany me here. I may have bit my tongue off in anger had it been only me. In other words… you are a soothing force in my life. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, all that <i>sentiment</i> is so <i>embarrassing</i>, Maaku. Aren’t you so above it all?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Protag.png"/> <i>I feel like my bond with Yusuke is growing deeper...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And now there are no skill cards we cannot duplicate. Rad.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> I… I will partake in Kawanabe’s exhibition. I am going to display my ability and prove him wrong. ...Come, let us go home. …… Actually, we should eat first. The sushi has done nothing wrong, after all. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-081.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-YusukeBlue.png"/> Now then, let us head off. <br/>

“Just a heads up: nothing’s changed. Just gonna keep stressing you guys out by worrying about this constantly. Okay, laters!”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-MakotoChat.jpg"/> I appreciate the consideration.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-HaruChat.jpg"/> I’ve yet to truly speak with him though.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-YusukeChat.jpg"/> As I’ve said before, this is just what happened to Madarame. There’s no need to worry. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-083.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
If you’re having trouble reading it, the bottom option says “No need to get hasty.” I misread it as “nasty” several times. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-AnnChat.png"/> He’s right. We don’t need to be worried. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-RyujiChat.png"/> In that case, ain’t it time to be talking about our next celebration party?<br/>
<br/>
You know, those things that always go well!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="111-FutabaChat.jpg"/> Too soon. Too stupid.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-RyujiChat.png"/> What was that!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-MakotoChat.jpg"/> We can talk about that some other time. For now, let’s wait patiently. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-HaruChat.jpg"/> Yes. I’ll contact everyone if anything comes up. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-084.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-TV.jpg"/> Our reporters succeeded in getting an interview with a man who used to work for the company. What he described was a harsh work environment where employees are not allowed any freedom. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Morgana.png"/> Whoa. Having a job sounds like a lot of hard work. What are you gonna do when you’re an adult?<br/>
<br/>
I’m an anime, Morgana. I’m never going to be an adult. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="113-085.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="114-086.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
*sigh* ...Hey, Mishima. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-MishimaSummer.png"/> Oh, right. Do you think we can talk about last time again? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-087.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Fine. I can’t believe I’m not done with you after your most recent escapade, but I’m so close to dropping you completely, just give me a damned excuse.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-MishimaSummer.png"/> Thanks. I want to go somewhere I can talk to you alone… How does the park sound? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="117-088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Here we go, he’s probably going to send us after this dude again...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="118-089.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-MishimaSummer.png"/> Huh!? W-Well, actually… I was just gonna say the same thing. <br/>
<br/>
Hm?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-MishimaSummer.png"/> I mean, going after him wouldn’t even help you guys get famous. It’d practically be pointless. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
For real dude, it’s bad for you.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-091.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-MishimaSummer.png"/> ...Wait, how’d you know about that!?<br/>
<br/>
I crawled inside your soul, dipshit. Not that I needed to do that to see how much you wanted to be famous. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-MishimaSummer.png"/> Of course a thief who steals hearts would see what’s going on in the depths of my psyche…<br/>
<br/>
We almost went through with it, too! Was really close, but you were just too pathetic. It wouldn’t have been sporting, really. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-MishimaSummer.png"/> You know, I first started the Phan-Site so I could spread your message of justice to the world… But before I knew it, the only reason I wanted to help you guys was so I could get famous myself. Though maybe that’s always been the real reason… I don’t know… I thought I was doing it out of respect for you guys… Yet deep down, I think I really just wanted to show the world I’m more than some stupid zero. Look where that got me though… I’m just a selfish loser clinging desperately to your popularity… I don’t deserve to work alongside the valiant Phantom Thieves. <br/>
<br/>
Well, at least he’s realizing it and doing some serious introspection. This is good for you, man.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-093.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Huh?<br/>
<br/>

For some reason Alleycat restarts here despite the fact that it was already playing.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="127-098.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Welp. That’s Mishima for you. Even when he’s doing something right it’s somehow pathetic. *sigh* That’s just him, though.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-MishimaSummer.png"/> I’m such an idiot… Hahaha… I can’t even run away right… *sigh* Working alongside the Phantom Thieves has made me feel like I myself can change the world… But it’s only ever been you guys… I’m still just as powerless as always. That’s the truth… Hahaha… I wonder if there’s really any way a pathetic guy like me can help you...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="128-099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Am I… really doing this?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="129-100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
…Dammit, Mishima. I’m… I’m giving you another shot. You haven’t really earned it, but… it’s worth a go, at least. Just… try. Try and be better. Hopefully I won’t regret this. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-MishimaSummer.png"/> Thank you… I’ll just have to think of what that might be… Wait, that’s it…! The Phan-Site! How could I have forgotten something as important as that!? I don’t want it to be about public relations anymore though. First and foremost, that site needs to be a safe haven for people in serious trouble. After all that happened to me with Kamoshida, I know how hard it can be to speak out against injustice… So… as long as there are voices crying out to the Phantom Thieves, I’m gonna help them be heard. <br/>
<br/>
This seems like a good first step. Good thinking, man.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Protag.png"/> <i>Mishima seems to be showing renewed motivation...</i> <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="130-101.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Even more experience, great! Even if Mishima isn’t always on the ball as much as we’d like, his Confidant abilities are at least top-notch.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="131-102.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-MishimaSummer.png"/> I’m still worried about some of the rumors I’ve heard about him, but I’ll do some more research. By the way, he’s not as bad a guy as he pretends to be. Apparently he’s super sweet to his girlfriend. Can you imagine that? They’ve been talking about getting married even since back in middle school. ...I’m honestly kinda jealous.<br/>
<br/>
Good on you Mishima, acknowledging that even your tormentors contain multitudes.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-MishimaSummer.png"/> Anyway, I’ll see you later.<br/>
<br/>
...And that’s probably one of the better Confidant events in the game, totally turning around (for me at least) a character who mainly exists to get rightfully shit all over constantly. Mishima’s still not a <i>great</i> person, but he’s a good character, at the very least.
