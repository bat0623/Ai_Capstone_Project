<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Stuhlbarg.jpg"/> They target corporations doing shady business and cause chaos. The subway company’s server thing? That was Medjed, trying to find out who caused the train accident.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Chatter.jpg"/> So, they’re good guys?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Stuhlbarg.jpg"/> Some liken them to digital Robin Hoods… But they snoop through emails and destroy data. They’re no better than criminals.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Whisper.jpg"/> They dare call themselves heroes after attacking those companies? Pfft.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, won’t someone think of the poor corporations?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Whisper.jpg"/> They’re fighting Medjed next!? The Phantom Thieves are amazing!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Murmur.jpg"/> I don’t wanna hear about justice from some shady hackers.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Whisper.jpg"/> I don’t care what happens, as long as it’s interesting!<br/>
<br/>
<b>Anon: Hang in there you guys! ;w;<br/>
Anon: They’re gonna do it, right?<br/>
Anon: can phantom thieves win?<br/>
Anon: When are they gonna react?<br/>
Anon: whoever wins is just!</b><br/>
<br/>
The just one is the winner, eh? Get off the internet, Kakyoin.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Anon: they’re both shit.</b><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Boy_2.jpg"/> Damn… I’m dead...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Girl_1.jpg"/> I wish I could get in the top ten… People look at smart students differently.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Protag.png"/> <i>I wonder what score I got… I’m in the top ten!</i><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> Whoa! Everyone’s gonna have their eyes on you now!<br/>

Maaku gains <b>Charm +3</b>.<br/>
<br/>
Charm is the reward for doing well on exams in Persona 5, whereas previously it was Social Link points with your classmates. P5 does some work to distance many (but not all) of its links from a school context, so getting Confidant points wouldn’t really make sense.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-RyujiSummer.png"/> Hey, it’s not my fault my scores suck, right?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-007.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-RyujiSummer.png"/> Anyways, there’s something more important here! Mishima...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-MishimaSummer.png"/> You want to ask me something about the internet, right?<br/>
<br/>
“No, Ryuji, it’s not a series of tubes.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-RyujiSummer.png"/> Yup. I’m gonna be straight with you here—do you know who Medjed is?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-MishimaSummer.png"/> You weren’t kidding about being direct. Well, I suppose the news about Medjed and the Phantom Thieves has caused quite the commotion… They started out as hackers of justice, but now they only look out for their own self-interests. ...That’s all I know. They were the group I texted Hamiru about yesterday.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-RyujiSummer.png"/> I see…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-MishimaSummer.png"/> Nobody’s sure who actually belongs to Medjed. Well, it looks like things’ll be exciting this summer. It’ll be the Phantom Thieves’ world debut, no?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-RyujiSummer.png"/> Dude...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-MishimaSummer.png"/> Don’t worry, I’ll be rooting for the Phantom Thieves. I’ll get the forum mobilized as well. Now if we’re done talking here, I really must be going. I’ll see you guys later.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-009.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-010.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-MakotoChat.jpg"/> I tried asking my sister, but it seemed as though she didn’t know very much about them. She doesn’t specialize in cybercrime, after all.<br/>
<br/>
“And then she yelled at me for no reason. All in all, it was an average Monday night.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-AnnChat.png"/> I tried looking into them too, but I didn’t come up with anything. There are really just no leads.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Hm, our opponent is truly elusive.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> Medjed, hm…? It seems like we won’t be able to deal with them by ourselves…<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Kawakami.png"/> We will be holding an emergency assembly on Monday the 25th. Please come to school that day.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The students begin to groan and chatter.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Kawakami.png"/> Settle down! We’ve has many strange incidents: the psychotic breakdowns, students being dragged into crime rings… Hence, Principal Kobayakawa has instructed all teachers to caution the student body. This is inconvenient for us too, you know? Having to find things to warn you about so suddenly...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-AnnChat.png"/> I’m not sure. No matter how hard I look online, all I find are just unreliable rumors.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-YusukeChat.jpg"/> They have carried out corporate terrorism, yet they still manage to elude arrest somehow.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Yeah… We don’t even know whether it’s a single individual or a large conglomerate of people. And even if we do manage to get a lead, what do we do from there?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-RyujiChat.png"/> Damn, this stuff’s really not going so good… That’s prolly why my exams’re going to shit too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-AnnChat.png"/> You know those are two separate things, right?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Question_Mark.png"/> Mwehehe… Clues on Medjed, huh…?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Placing in the top ten has changed some things about our perception around school… for today at least.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-025.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-026.jpg"/><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-030.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Even if they’re going to keep avoiding us, it’s nice to see them awestruck by our brainpower. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Girl_1.jpg"/> Akechi-kun was saying those hackers showed up again because of the Phantom Thieves.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Girl_5.jpg"/> Hackers and Phantom Thieves sound like something out of a manga though. It’s funny if you think about it. I wonder who’d win in a fight. A lot of people online are getting excited over all this.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Newspaper.jpg"/> If there’s anything you’d like to know, ask away. Consider it the newspaper club’s special service.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Newspaper.jpg"/> There’s excitement over the Phantom Thieves, but there’s also a lot of talk about summer plans. Some students are studying like mad for their college entrance exams, so their summer won’t be as relaxed.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Newspaper.jpg"/> Ah, it’d be a major scoop if I knew. Secret identities are definitely front page material. The mass media knows it’d be major news too. Shujin Academy will likely draw attention again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Newspaper.jpg"/> There’s been all this excitement over the Phantom Thieves. You hear a lot about them too, right? Now that they’ve crushed the mafia, everyone is waiting for their next move.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
*raises eyebrows*<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Newspaper.jpg"/> I’ve… got my newspaper club activities. There’s plenty to do with all these incidents going on. I’m hoping I can attract new members if I write up some really good articles.<br/>
<br/>
No, I was… oh, never mind.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Gaudy_Female_Student.jpg"/> He’s still saying the Phantom Thieves are dangerous, right? That loner must not have any friends.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Teacher_1.jpg"/> Hey, now. Don’t say that. Everyone’s allowed to have their own opinion. But he does seem too smart to be in high school. You could be right about him being lonely.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Gaudy_Female_Student.jpg"/> Well, I guess I’m glad that I’m stupid then. Hahaha!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Boom_Box.jpg"/> Do you think the Phantom Thieves are a danger to society? Send us your opinions by email or fax.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Old_Man_3.jpg"/> Phantom Thieves…? They’re not real. There’s no way people like that are real.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Lawyer.jpg"/> And thanks to the internet, now everyone knows the police were just full of talk. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Winger.jpg"/> Now that the police have lost face, the mass media will swing over to the Phantom Thieves. Phantom Thieves, huh? Looks like things’ll get pretty busy for us soon.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't get portraits of these clowns due to the fixed camera angle so here, have an amazing stock photo and also Jeff Winger.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-036.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-ChihayaChat.jpg"/> We can’t do it when it rains though, since we’ll be outside… Come during the day for your fortune and at night for the test.<br/>
<br/>
Chihaya’s contacted us to say that we can actually talk to her during the day now (as long as it isn’t raining), which is handy (and, in fact, necessary) for some of her fortune readings. Her Confidant is still only available at night, though. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> ...Um, if you’re available, I’d like to talk to you about Eiko.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Protag.png"/> &gt;Hang out with her<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> Thank goodness. I have a small favor to ask you… Let’s get a drink before we talk.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Wait, a host? I’ve played enough Yakuza to know how skeevy that sounds. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> I guess he, um… hit on her one day after her shift, and that was that. Since then he’s the only thing she’ll talk about. She even sent me a picture of their date at Destinyland.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-040.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> For now it seems he hasn’t forced her to spend any money at his club, but I’m still nervous… Beyond that, he calls her his “princess” and constantly tells her how special she is. It makes me sick to my stomach. But Eiko refuses to listen to me. She said the idea that all hosts are bad people is outdated…<br/>
<br/>
But the idea that all people willing to date high schoolers are bad people is very much not so.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> She even said she was shocked to be getting advice from someone who would “totally flunk a test about love.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-042.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-043.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> S-Sorry about that. I’m probably just being biased towards him. I mean, I don’t have any proof that he’s untrustworthy… But that’s why I want to meet him and find out for myself what kind of person he really is. And… if it’s not too much to ask, I’d like you to accompany me on this excursion as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> This time, um… you’ll have to play the role of my boyfriend.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I was born ready!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> I think if I have a boyfriend, Eiko might be more inclined to listen to me. To tell you the truth… I actually already made plans with her and her boyfriend for a double date. S-Sorry. But it’s just going to be at a diner. Nothing particularly fancy, I promise. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Protag.png"/> *nods*<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> Thank you! You’re a tremendous help. I’m so glad you agreed to this. I don’t know who else I’d have asked if you had said no...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Protag.png"/> <i>I can sense Makoto’s trust in me...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> Eiko… I hope she’s not getting herself wrapped up in anything dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
Says the Phantom Thief.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> But just in case, I’ll try looking for some info on that host. Well, see you later.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-049.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-AnnChat.png"/> Did you find anything?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-YusukeChat.jpg"/> As you know, Medjed is a god that appears in the Egyptian Book of the Dead.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-AnnChat.png"/> Huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Its name apparently means “the smiter.” It seems nobody is actually sure that Medjed is a real name. On top of that, almost everything else about him is unknown. Even his form is unattainable. An unseen god that flies through the sky and shoots from his eyes… He truly is an elusive being.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-RyujiChat.png"/> Dude.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Everything about his existence is shrouded in mystery.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-RyujiChat.png"/> Wait.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Fundamentally speaking, ancient Egyptian art always depicted gods drawn in a side profile.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-YusukeChat.jpg"/> I hope that information was at least somewhat useful.<br/>
<br/>
It was… something, all right.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Indeed it was.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Should I look into it more?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-MakotoChat.jpg"/> That’s enough, thank you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> So, we still don’t have any tangible clues...<br/>
<br/>
For reference, Medjed looks like this:<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-Medjed.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
What the hell.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-TV.jpg"/> In the past few years, the damage they have caused has grown to several hundred billion yen. Even this year, there have been several cyber attacks attributed to Medjed.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> What a mysterious group… Just what is their goal?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-College_Student_2.jpg"/> Did they just declare war? I wonder if the Phantom Thieves stand a chance against Medjed...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-College_Student_1.jpg"/> The Phantom Thieves got this! They got this shit, m’dude! Onward toward victory!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-College_Student_2.jpg"/> Uh… Yeah, sure. Anyways, we got finals, so we gotta get home.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Beefy_Trendsetter.jpg"/> How did that happen!? Does this have to do with all that news lately?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Scruffy_Romantic.jpg"/> When I’m on the internet, these peculiar screens keep popping up. And I get these weird bills...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Beefy_Trendsetter.jpg"/> Whoa there… Did you click some shady links on a porn site!?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-055.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Chihaya.png"/> Bring it on! We’re not done with these tests yet! I’m actually doing a reading for a client right now, so please stay and watch...<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Chihaya.png"/> This is your first time coming to my stand, yes?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Office_Worker.jpg"/> Y-Yeah, um… A colleague of mine recommended you. He said you can help fix my problems… Is that right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Chihaya.png"/> Of course! Fate is… absolute…<br/>
<br/>
As Chihaya says this, she looks over at Maaku.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Office_Worker.jpg"/> S-So, um, the thing is… I’m engaged to be married. Next spring, I’ll be trying the knot with a friend I’ve had since all the way back in preschool...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Chihaya.png"/> So, what’s worrying you? Is it perhaps the date of the ceremony, or perhaps the location of your honeymoon?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Office_Worker.jpg"/> O-Oh, um… No, it’s not like that. The problem is… I’m not entirely sure we’ll be able to get married. The truth is, the president of one of our major business partners has offered me her daughter’s hand...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Chihaya.png"/> Ah… So this is what it means to be weighed down by societal obligations...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Office_Worker.jpg"/> Do, um… Do you think it would be bad if I declined that president’s offer…? Haha… Hahaha...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Chihaya.png"/> Please relax. The divine power will bring us your answer!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-059.jpg"/><br/>

Huh… I guess guys would line up to date such an amazing girl… Well, I’m not going to let that happen! The only one who can make her happy is me! I was a fool for hesitating, even for a moment…! I… I’m going to marry her! Thank you so much!<br/>

Money Reading is a skill that I’ve never used but is obviously incredibly useful. For 5,000 yen, we can increase the amount of money we gain from battles for the rest of the day. This is, no shit, incredibly lopsided in our favor. I haven’t been able to find any stats on the percentage increase, but I don’t think it’s 50% because that would be fucking absurd. Even if it’s like 10%, it’s well worth it to spend the cash every time we head into a Palace or Mementos, as long as it’s not raining. <b>Edit: Apparently it is, in fact, obscenely high, but only applies to battles finished by All-out Attacks for whatever reason. If this is documented anywhere in the game, I've never seen it. Still, it's fucking amazing.</b><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-GoroSummer.png"/> I didn’t think Medjed would pounce on the Phantom Thieves. Interesting things keep happening this year. The influence of #Millennials knows no bounds… I underestimated it, honestly. I wonder what the public thinks of this. Are they entertained? Or perhaps inconvenienced?<br/>

<br/>
I don’t know, from what you’re saying they sound like fine anticapitalists to me!<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> Who is this? Why does he know that you’re a phantom thief? Is one of our teammates pulling a prank on you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="117-Alibaba.jpg"/> There is someone whose heart I would like you to steal. But I’m not asking for charity. Let’s make a deal. You wish to know about Medjed, correct? I can give you information on them if the change of heart is successful. If you so desire, I can take care of them as well. Do you believe in my skills? I can track down their accounts, just as I have with yours. But this is all I can prove at the moment. I’ve prepared the necessary tool on my end. Look forward to it.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-YusukeBlue.png"/> How were we found out?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> He may have traced our chat log...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-YusukeBlue.png"/> How careless of us…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> But how would he have known all these details with just that…?<br/>
<br/>
Uh, we’ve been pretty fuckin’ cavalier about discussing Phantom Thieves business via text, Makoto.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-YusukeBlue.png"/> Do you think that there is another cause?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> Yeah. I’m not sure why, but that’s the feeling I get.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-AnnSummer.png"/> Hey, is it that easy to look at someone’s chat log?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> I don’t know much about it myself, but… it’s probably not impossible, I think?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-RyujiSummer.png"/> How’s it done?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> Maybe they extracted our phones’ data…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-AnnSummer.png"/> Why’s Maaku getting an error when he tries to reply?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> Perhaps the receiving end doesn’t exist?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="123-082.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="124-083.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> I don’t get high tech stuff! What does this all mean?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-AnnSummer.png"/> An unknown hacker contacted us!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> I see. I don’t really get it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-YusukeBlue.png"/> Then, is this person Medjed?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> I doubt it, considering he says he wants to “deal” with them. That is, only if we take his words for face value.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-YusukeBlue.png"/> True...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-RyujiSummer.png"/> Hey… Wouldn’t it be great if we got this guy on our side?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> But we know nothing about his identity at all. We can’t trust him.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-RyujiSummer.png"/> I don’t think it’s a bad deal though...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-YusukeBlue.png"/> Even if Alibaba turns out to be a criminal? I am not helping anyone of that sort.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-RyujiSummer.png"/> Oh, right. That wouldn’t be good...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Morgana.png"/> The “I’ve prepared the necessary tool” part makes no sense either.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-AnnSummer.png"/> Could this just be a prank?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> He knows an awful lot for it to be a prank.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-AnnSummer.png"/> If he knows who we are, won’t we get caught?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> No. If he wanted to report us, I think he would’ve done it already.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-YusukeBlue.png"/> He must have some sort of objective of his own. He did offer us a deal, after all. I’m certain he’ll contact us again.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> There’s no telling when he’ll do so though… It’d be best if we stay together. If something happens, we can act at once.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-AnnSummer.png"/> Yeah. So, somewhere we can wait and hide for long hours...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> How about Leblanc?<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-RyujiSummer.png"/> What does that all mean!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> They’re saying that they’ll target sympathizers of the Phantom Thieves.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-YusukeBlue.png"/> Confiscation of possessions, hm…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoSummer.png"/> Perhaps bank accounts or personal information… Either way, it won’t be anything pleasant.<br/>

Those on the other side say Medjed are “hackers of justice.” But there’s nothing resembling justice in what they do. Someday, I want the whole site to be filled with pro-Thieves comments. I’m looking forward to when that day finally arrives.<br/>
