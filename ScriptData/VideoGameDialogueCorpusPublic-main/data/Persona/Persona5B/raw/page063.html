<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-RyujiChat.png"/> What’s Kosei like? Is it filled with guys like Yusuke?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-AnnChat.png"/> I imagine there are a lot of “different” people there.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Now that you mention it, I have one very interesting classmate. She is a female shogi player, and seemingly quite the skilled one at that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Are you talking about Hifumi Togo? I remember hearing she’s a student at Kosei. They say she’s the most beautiful shogi player around right now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-RyujiChat.png"/> Dude, that sounds too good to be true! Gimme some more info!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-YusukeChat.jpg"/> I do not know much about her. She is not the kind of person to let others close to her.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-MakotoChat.jpg"/> It sounds like she only focuses on her shogi pursuits. After all, it’s said she is a lone genius...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-YusukeChat.jpg"/> However, I have heard she is commonly seen at the church over in Kanda.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-RyujiChat.png"/> For real!? We gotta go!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-AnnChat.png"/> You’ll probably get struck down by a bolt of lightning if you’re going for that ulterior motive.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-RyujiChat.png"/> That ain’t it! This is for the Phantom Thieves!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, this should be good.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-RyujiChat.png"/> I mean, shogi’s a kinda battle, right? She’s gotta know all sorts of insane strategies and stuff!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-AnnChat.png"/> Uh...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-YusukeChat.jpg"/> That is quite the stretch.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Churches are supposed to be holy. Don’t do this, Ryuji.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-RyujiChat.png"/> Urgh, you guys’re gonna pay for this one day! Maaku, you go spy on her for me! Find out if she’s really as cute as they say she is.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> *sigh* Let’s ignore that idiot. Anyway, a shogi expert, huh? Striking an enemy with but a moment’s inspiration, skillfully strategizing toward victory… Those might actually be good tactics to know for our work as the Phantom Thieves. They said she’s at the church in Kanda, right? We should check it out when you have the time.<br/>
<br/>
I like how we completely dismiss Ryuji there and then do exactly what he wanted for the same bullshit reason he suggested.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We can go to Kanda now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It’s the two Uji Matcha Flans we ordered! They’re pretty worthless!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chatter.jpg"/> Ah, yes, I’d have to say Hifumi Togo. She does a very good job of balancing offense and defense. Not to mention, she’s very pretty.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-TV.jpg"/> Yes, I’ve heard she’s started doing some modeling work recently.<br/>
<br/>
Well, let’s head over to Kanda and see Hifumi, then.<br/>
<br/>

In Japanese this track is called “Penalty Time,” which always makes me think there’s like a hockey rink or some shit before I remember what track it is.<br/>
<br/>

This is the church. It’s rather tiny.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chatter.jpg"/> Lambs who’ve strayed from their path and lost sight of their goals in this life are welcome here. Simply put, I offer solace and advice to those with worries or who wish to reflect on their past.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> Hmm, this seems like a convenient place to-- Wait, did he say “reflect on their past”?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This feature returns from P4G, though now we can do it whenever we want instead of only on specific days for each party member. We still won’t be making use of it, because it’s better to get it right the first time.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> That might be quite useful to you if you had something that you wanted to remember. ...Just make sure you don’t offend him or make him angry by brushing off his advice.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> Maybe she’s Hifumi Togo, the one Yusuke mentioned… Why don’t you go ask her?<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-HifumiSummer.png"/> I’m doing some research, so… Experimenting with new tactics is best to do alone in a place like this. ...Well, I suppose that doesn’t sound terribly plausible to someone who doesn’t play… Don’t mind me; please go ahead and pray.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Protag.png"/> <i>Hifumi Togo seems to take a very tactical approach to playing shogi. I feel like I can learn some tactics for the Phantom Thieves from her shogi expertise. I should ask her if she’ll teach me...</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-HifumiSummer.png"/> I’ll start.<br/>

<br/>
Hifumi slams the piece down onto the board with a resounding CLAP.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-HifumiSummer.png"/> ...It’s checkmate no matter how you look at it. Please concede.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-HifumiSummer.png"/> To concede is an act of admitting that you have lost, with grace. If you aspire to become a shogi player, I recommend that you take your study of the game to heart. Thank you for playing… Well then, that will be all for today… If it’s all right with you, may I request another match sometime?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-HifumiSummer.png"/> I feel… a gambler’s spirit emanating from you. Which is strange, since your style of play is that of a complete novice...<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-HifumiSummer.png"/> Huh…!? Oh, I-I’m sorry… However, I will instruct you under one condition… You become my playing partner so that I can research new moves. Is that agreeable?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-HifumiSummer.png"/> Thank you very much… Well then, it’s a deal. I’ll teach you how to play, and you’ll assist me with my new moves.<br/>

Star is the arcana of hope and inspiration, and represents lack of faith and despair when reversed. It’s all about idealism.<br/>
<br/>
Hifumi’s skills don’t have a whole lot to do with each other, mostly just being a random grab bag of Confidant skills they wanted to shove in somewhere. They’re still pretty useful, though. I didn’t end up using Koma Sabaki much because it costs a turn (and also because all my main party eventually had SP Adhesive 3s on at all times), but I can imagine it being helpful to get yourself out of a jam or just make it easier to cover all your bases in terms of elemental affinities.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Kawakami.png"/> A young woman wearing all brand clothing and an older man with gold accessories were arguing. Both were on their high horse, and even though they dressed fancily, it felt nouveau riche. Speaking of, the Japanese words for “high horse” and “nouveau riche” both originated as shogi terms. A lot of people aren’t familiar with shogi, but it’s good to know a little bit about it. <br/>
<br/>
Goddammit, what is it with shogi right now?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Kawakami.png"/> So, Hamiru-kun. Have you seen this piece before?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-031.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This game has been localized well.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Kawakami.png"/> That’s right. This is the cursive form of the kanji for “gold,” which is written on the back of the pawn.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Kawakami.png"/> A weak piece like a pawn can become gold if you get it into the enemy’s camp, hence “nouveau riche.”<br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Knowledge +1</b>.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Kawakami.png"/> By the way, nouveau riche like to wear expensive clothes because of a desire to be acknowledged. Once humans fulfill the basic needs of clothing, good, and shelter, our next desire is recognition. That’s why people try to make themselves seem bigger by flaunting their power through money.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> Making yourself seem bigger… Reminds me of a frilled lizard.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-Sojiro.png"/> You’re salty…? That reminds me, I was just about to head out and grab some salt for the shop. I’ll be back in a bit.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> Wait, in that case… maybe the Holy Stone is supposed to help you get better at cooking!<br/>

This stupid cat<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> B-But if that’s not it, then what’s it for…? ...Hold on a second, the Holy Stone was supposed to change your future, not improve your cooking skills!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> That fortune teller’s name was Chihaya, right? She clearly has some kind of mystical power… but this is just unacceptable. ...We need to go complain to her!<br/>
<br/>
Or, and hear me out: we could slash her tires. Your idea’s great, but I like mine a lot too.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Protag.png"/> <i>It turns out the Holy Stone I bought from Chihaya was a fake. I should go talk to her and try to figure out her true intentions...</i><br/>
<br/>
This is what I deserve, isn’t it? For being so stupid?<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-Office_Worker.jpg"/> Yes, they’re the ones with the “calling card.” I heard they had an altercation with the yakuza. <br/>
<br/>
Um, it’s the “mafia,” thank you.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-Office_Worker.jpg"/> They seem to be very popular among young people. Though I don’t know why.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-Office_Worker_2.jpg"/> There’s no telling why these days. However, I believe they may be able to build their own business.<br/>

Foreign Barker’s quest to be polite with the help of a cat is one of my favorite subplots in this game.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-Woman_1.jpg"/> I-I’m fine. It’s my fault anyway, Yuya said so… He says he doesn’t want to hit me, but I just make him so mad…<br/>
<br/>
Oh! Fuck this!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Chihaya.png"/> I suggest you break up with him. Things are only going to get worse at this rate.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-Woman_1.jpg"/> B-But I’m the only person that cares about him! If I leave, how will he survive…? Please, is there any other way?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Chihaya.png"/> ...Let us ask the tarot. O divine power, shed light upon her fate...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-087.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Chihaya.png"/> Yes, I’ve seen everything. Hm… I can sense a dark presence within your boyfriend. His heart seems to be possessed by a demon. This demon may hide itself away at times, but when it strikes, it will bring with it great misery.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-Woman_1.jpg"/> Wh-What kind of misery…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Chihaya.png"/> You will be hospitalized for severe injuries suffered in a domestic abuse incident, and he will be arrested.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-Woman_1.jpg"/> What? Hospitalized!? A-Arrested!? I knew I shouldn’t have let Yuya throw my Holy Stone away! He said I shouldn’t be wasting my money on some dumb rock… that I should be giving it to him instead. This is my punishment for letting him do that, right? Please, let me buy another one from you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Chihaya.png"/> Wh-What…? You want another?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-Woman_1.jpg"/> My next stone will need to be even bigger. I’m a little low on cash at the moment… but you said I can pay in up to thirty-six installments, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Chihaya.png"/> Um, truthfully, I feel breaking up with him would be the best--<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-Woman_1.jpg"/> I can’t abandon Yuya!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> There’s no way that could be true… right?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Man, this cat is dumb.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> Right. It would make our jobs way easier if you could really change someone’s heart with a Holy Stone. It’s clear that Chihaya has some fortune telling skills, but that stone isn’t going to do anything… ...Hey, Maaku! Why don’t we change that “Yuya” guy’s heart ourselves? I mean, he’s hurting this woman here, right? This is the perfect chance for the Phantom Thieves to save her!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="124-090.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="125-091.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Chihaya.png"/> The demon within your boyfriend’s heart… cannot be exorcised by normal human methodologies. Fate is… absolute. A-Although, I guess you might be able to control the demon’s temper if you bought another Holy Stone… …...<br/>
<br/>
This is Chihaya. Chihaya is a terrible person.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="129-095.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-Woman_1.jpg"/> U-Um, I’m not entirely sure who you are… But do you know of any other way I can approach this problem…?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="130-096.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-Woman_1.jpg"/> Mine? Oh… You’re talking about Yuya, aren’t you? It’s <b>Yuya Uchimura</b>… Um… why do you want to know? What are you planning on doing?<br/>
<br/>
I’m surprised her immediate assumption isn’t just that I’ll fucking merc this dude.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Chihaya.png"/> Y-Yes! What do you expect to change with that meager information…?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="131-097.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Chihaya.png"/> What…? You honestly believe you can do something!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-Woman_1.jpg"/> …… I… I trust you.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="132-098.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Chihaya.png"/> Excuse me!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-Woman_1.jpg"/> It feels like he’s telling the truth. Besides, Yuya has all my money. He’s going to pay me back someday… But for now, I would rather put my trust in this one boy than in thirty-six payments for a Holy Stone.<br/>
<br/>
Boy, you sure changed your mind about that Holy Stone quick.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Chihaya.png"/> What!?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="133-099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Chihaya.png"/> You! What do you think you’re doing!? If you keep making false accusations like that, the divine power will rain punishment down upon you!<br/>
<br/>
...Um, I never accused anyone of anything.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Chihaya.png"/> ……? You look so pleased with yourself… Hm, I’ve seen everything. A vision of you groveling on the ground… Fate cannot be changed… and I will prove that fact to you! If that woman stays with her abusive boyfriend, she will meet a horrible injury within a year’s time. Now, if you honestly believe you can change her destiny, go ahead and try! But once you realize the error in your thinking, come back and let a true expert handle things. I will save her… with a Holy Stone…!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="134-100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Christ, what an asshole.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Chihaya.png"/> Well then, are we done here? I’m way too busy for this!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="135-101.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And we get a new request, which we’ll have to make sure to complete some time in the near future.
