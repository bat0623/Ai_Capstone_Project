<br/>
I was wondering if this was a real thing but sure enough, <a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2013/02/20/popular-voice-actors-to-narrate-at-planetarium" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">it is.</a> Though that article isn’t in great English, whatever. I guess part of me is just surprised that planetariums are a popular date spot in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> ...In any case, it’s not the kind of place you’d visit alone. I recommend taking someone. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> The planetarium in <b>Ikebukuro</b> is probably the closest one to here, so that’s pretty convenient. <br/>

And with that, we have every hangout spot unlocked. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kawakami.png"/> Why’re you looking at me like that? I’m not sleep deprived because I want to be, you know. My neighbors have been careless lately on garbage day… The crows were cawing away this morning. Those trash nets the city makes us use only keep them away at the start. Crows are quick learners. On that note, do you all know how to write the kanji for “crow”?<br/>
<br/>
Oh boy, a kanji quiz!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kawakami.png"/> The characters for “bird” and “crow” look very similar, but the latter has one fewer line. What do you think, Hamiru-kun? Isn’t it easy to confuse with “bird”? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-009.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
At least this one is kinda solvable if you think about it and ignore the obviously wrong answers. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kawakami.png"/> Exactly. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-capture_739_24072018_114938.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kawakami.png"/> Even though the kanji is missing the eye line, crow actually have pretty good vision. <br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Knowledge +1</b>.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kawakami.png"/> By the way, one reading for a different “crow” kanji is “ga,” to imitate the sound of it cawing. The character for “pigeon” is the same. It’s based on the bird’s coo, leading to the “ku” pronunciation. Crows are pretty smart, so you’d better study enough so that you don’t lose to them.<br/>
<br/>
??????<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> Crows are scary, lemme tell ya. When your eyes meet, they start flapping and… *shudder*<br/>

Is it really a thing that Japanese students go to restaurants to study? I feel like doing that in America would get the cops sicced on you for loitering. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto.png"/> I think she knew it deep within her heart, and seeing him like that finally helped her realize. <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto.png"/> Oh, and she told me she quit her job. Right now she doesn’t know what she wants to do, but she’s going to go to college and figure things out. So in the end, Eiko’s going to start seriously focusing on her studies again. I plan on doing the same as well. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto.png"/> Yes. I thought there was no point in continuing my studies, but… This time I’m not seeking anyone’s praise, and I’m not trying to show off my intelligence. I simply want to fulfill my own personal goals and dreams. Before now, I didn’t have a clear vision of what that meant. I was lost in life… But thanks to you, I’ve finally come to realize it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Uhhh, what? You sure about that, Makoto?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you should probably give up.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Also, to completely betray your own sense of justice! I fuckin’ read up on Japanese cops after the last time I complimented them for the futon thing; they’ll just hold people for three weeks with no charge to extract a confession! There’s a dude who got tortured for a confession and then spent 46 years on death row! I’m not sure that’s the kind of shit you wanna be involved in, because your sister’s already neck-deep in it and I thought you’d know better just from watching her!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto.png"/> There are too many incidents in this country that are never brought to light. That host was one.<br/>
<br/>
You know that sometimes Japanese police just fabricate confessions and then pressure the accused into signing them?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto.png"/> Villains who prey on the hearts of the weak with cowardly, legally questionable methods… <br/>
<br/>
I read that one prosecutor thinks that like a tenth of all confessions leading to prison time are coerced from innocent suspects, and that figure’s probably a rather low estimate.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto.png"/> My father risked his life trying to catch a group of those people. I will never forgive them. But I won’t be able to eradicate them all on my own… Instead, I want to head an organization that will destroy the lawless and help rescue victims.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I see. So you’re just hopelessly naive. Well, that’s a little bit better, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that’s an <i>amazing</i> dream.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto.png"/> That is the justice I aim for. I also believe it will be a continuation of my father’s legacy. <br/>
<br/>
Of vicious compromise in the name of an uncaring, unfeeling system?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto.png"/> Honestly, it’s a little strange that I found the true meaning of my studies outside of my studies. I think now I’ll be able to see the world even more differently. ...Thank you for all your help. Must have been difficult babysitting the uptight Miss President, right? <br/>

I’m in talks with a lawyer right now though. We’re going to get refunds and outpatient care for all of them. I’m going to give back all the money I made from selling Holy Stones too. It’s the least I can do to atone for the ignorance I showed back then. That’s why… I want you to accept this, Hamiru-san.

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kawakami.png"/> I’m changing my lesson for today. Instead of a regular class, we’ll be reviewing last week’s materials. I suggest you listen carefully. But don’t think you can slack off, OK? I absolutely won’t allow it. No slacking off! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> Kawakami’s graciously given us this free time, so we’d better put it to good use. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> Hmm. Is it really possible to get better at batting just by reading a book? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> It really went into detail about how you can identify what kind of pitch is coming at you… We should go to the batting cages sometime and try out what you learned! <br/>

Nine days left. We’re fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Girl_5.jpg"/> No way… Is someone getting arrested? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Girl_6.jpg"/> I have no idea. If someone’s getting arrested though, I hope the police take them away soon. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Girl_5.jpg"/> If the Phantom Thieves hear this, we might be in danger. I hope we don’t get dragged into this mess.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Chatter.jpg"/> Even if it’s a joke, I don’t wanna see it. That shit’s a straight up terrorist logo. I feel sick… Maybe Hamiru IS dangerous after all…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-MorganaSquint.png"/> They seriously despise us… This is too much to handle… <br/>
<br/>
Awesome, tanked my own reputation for no reason!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-072.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Girl_5.jpg"/> Does that mean they don’t go to Shujin? That’s a relief… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Girl_4.jpg"/> Sure, but the police need to hurry up—they’re turning people into vegetables left and right. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Girl_5.jpg"/> The Phantom Thieves are so dangerous… Maybe Akechi-kun can do something about it. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-Teacher_1.jpg"/> I suppose it’s because I want to exercise my right to do it. Then again, it’s not like my vote will change anything. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-Gaudy_Female_Student.jpg"/> I guess what I want to know is why doesn’t everyone go? I guess not voting is like having a seat change in class while you’re away! I don’t think I’d like that. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-Boy_4.jpg"/> I pretended to be a Phantom Thief since I idolized them, but now I wonder what real justice is like. Hey, you think you could tell me what really defines a hero? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-076.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-Boy_4.jpg"/> You’re right. Here goes. I guess a hero is someone who helps someone… who needs… help. Aw, I know that sounds dumb! It was all I could think of on the spur of the moment. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-Boy_4.jpg"/> I think I get it. Even if I became a Phantom Thief, I wouldn’t be a hero if I didn’t help anyone. Hehe… Thanks, you really helped me out there. I guess that sort of means you’re my hero, you know? <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-Reporter.jpg"/> So you’re saying the one-sided bashing is too much, hm? As you can see, there are some who express their doubts about the biased news reports. The media may need to consider whether or not they are truly being impartial. And that concludes our on-the-spot coverage.<br/>
<br/>
This news lady who keeps railroading my answers for some reason is using it to attack… her own profession. All right, then.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Protestor.jpg"/> The world will be swallowed by the surge of darkness… like the Phantom Thieves were!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Protestor.jpg"/> How can I believe in murderers!? People have been losing their minds left and right, you know? What should I do…? Please tell me… Sun God...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-081.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-Man_5.jpg"/> Forget about economic reform, and focus more on the female form. We need to pick up more girls! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-Man_7.jpg"/> You already have plenty of girls though, Senpai! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-Man_5.jpg"/> W-Well, I’m thinking of learning from Shido. Maybe start the New Pick-Up Party. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-082.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-Woman_9.jpg"/> Alone? What about your maid? Have you let the poor dear go? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-Woman_8.jpg"/> We had to. Can’t spare any unnecessary expenses during this tumultuous time, can we?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-Woman_9.jpg"/> Such an admirable woman you’ve become. Well, as they say—pride comes before a fall. Ohoho...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="111-083.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-Boy_14.jpg"/> Just a lot of fake stuff. Any mention of the Phantom Thieves always brings in the trolls. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="113-Girl_8.jpg"/> They used to be so popular… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-Boy_14.jpg"/> That’s old news. Of course people were upset after finding out they were murderers. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="114-084.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-Winger.jpg"/> I’d say yes in a heartbeat. I don’t want to bring my personal emotions into my work, but… Many people have risen up against society before, but this time, it’s on a different scale. I just really want to see what the Phantom Thieves would do. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-085.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="117-Promoter.jpg"/> No one knows how they commit their crimes. Are you worried no place is safe from them? Don’t be a victim of your own fear.

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-Maid.jpg"/> I hear the girls at my cafe saying “Akechi-kun, save me!” all the time. Everyone sure likes him now. He used to be really unpopular, didn’t he? The whole internet was flaming him for a while. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-Office_Worker.jpg"/> Hey, people always switch sides! We gotta cheer on the good guys, whoever they are! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-Maid.jpg"/> ...Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-087.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-Man_3.jpg"/> Oh yeah, that one where they’re getting stopped by the police? I laughed so hard at that! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="123-Nerd.jpg"/> Akechi was right… Only fools would say the Phantom Thieves stand for justice. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-Man_3.jpg"/> ...Hey, didn’t you like the Phantom Thieves? Ah, and Akechi’s gone now too. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="124-088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Woman_7.jpg"/> Please, can you stop? You made a profit. Isn’t that enough? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="125-Busy_Young_Man.jpg"/> No, not yet! We have to wait until it doubles in value! Yes, this country will change! Our celebrolution has only just begun! <br/>
<br/>
This poor woman.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="126-089.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="138-100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="137-HaruGym.png"/> Then it’s decided. This particular restaurant is an expensive hotel buffet. Hopefully the coffee lives up to that reputation. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="139-101.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-Haru.png"/> Well, I’ve decided to start studying the topic more seriously by going out to places like this. I’ve been keeping it a secret from my fiance though. You see, just a single cup of the Dark Ivory coffee here costs roughly six thousand yen. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="141-102.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="142-103.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-Haru.png"/> Either way, perhaps we should try it before passing judgement… Well, shall we order? I’ll be paying for your cup as well. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="143-104.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I want so badly to say “Kthx,” but alas, it feels too jokey.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="144-105.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-Haru.png"/> But allow me to handle this. I invited you, after all. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Protag.png"/> *nods*<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-Haru.png"/> Hm, I wonder how it will taste. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="145-106.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-Haru.png"/> Well, here we go...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="146-107.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Protag.png"/> <i>There is a faint bitterness beneath the strangely mellow flavor… The coffee is clearly distinct from what Sojiro serves at Leblanc…</i><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-Haru.png"/> ...It has a distinctly fragrant aroma, paired with a mild flavor. This is undoubtedly delicious, yet… I would barely consider it coffee. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="147-108.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I suddenly understand why it’s called “Dark Ivory.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="148-109.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="149-110.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I’m glad you think this is funny, at least.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-Haru.png"/> I just thought you might find it hard to enjoy If you had known ahead of time. I was surprised to hear it at first myself, but that was actually why I wanted to try it to begin with. Another rare type of coffee, kopi luwak, is gathered from the feces of a small cat called a civet. Interestingly enough, the flavor differs depending on what animal it was originally consumed by. Speaking of cats, do you think Mona-chan would be able to…?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="150-111.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Fuck yeah, let’s abuse this cat.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="151-112.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-Haru.png"/> Oh, but we need Mona-chan for our operations, huh? We can’t afford to make him eat beans all day… <br/>
<br/>
The only reason we shouldn’t do it, then.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-Haru.png"/> Hm… Coffee is so profound… <br/>
<br/>
You got that from cat shit beans?<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="154-Takakura.jpg"/> What a strange place for us to meet. It’s not often I see people your age at this luxurious buffet. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="155-115.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-Haru.png"/> Oh, he’s a friend from school. Maaku-kun, this is Takakura-san, the new president of Okumura Foods. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Protag.png"/> *nods*<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="154-Takakura.jpg"/> *nods* By the way, it looks like we will be able to avoid litigation. We somehow settled on decent terms. You don’t need to worry. Oh, and about your shares… you should consider letting the company hold on to them for the time being. I’m sure you have enough on your plate already, given everything that’s happened to you. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-Haru.png"/> Well, I… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="154-Takakura.jpg"/> Ah, I’m sorry to bring that up while you two are enjoying yourselves here. That aside, how are things going with Sugimura-kun? You know, these days you need to reserve a wedding hall almost a year in advance if you want a good one. Sometimes it worries me how laid-back you are, Haru-chan.<br/>
<br/>
Tactful Man is on the scene!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-Haru.png"/> R-Right. We’re in the process… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="154-Takakura.jpg"/> Well, I should be heading back to the office now. Oh, but please allow me to pay for your drinks. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-Haru.png"/> N-No, that’s quite all right. And, um… about the shares… I can handle them for now. I’m going to protect that which my father left for me. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="154-Takakura.jpg"/> ...I understand. Please do try to reconsider though. Well, if you’ll excuse me. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="156-116.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-Haru.png"/> I mean, I’m just an inexperience high schooler… but I can’t leave the company in Takakura-san’s hands. Hey, um… what did you think of him?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="157-117.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="158-118.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-Haru.png"/> But… I agree. I really don’t know whether or not I can trust him… Right now, the most prevalent rumor about Takakura-san is that he was pleased by my father’s passing… I mean, he was certainly the person who stood to benefit the most from it… It’s hard to deny that fact. But… he says he’s trying to rebuild our company image. I just can’t tell if he really means it… ...You know, sometimes I wonder what life would be like if I didn’t have money… if I was normal. Don’t get me wrong, the company is definitely important… but it’s often nothing more than a source of stress. With you guys though… I feel like I actually belong. That’s why I’m going to work extra hard to make sure my harvests turn out great! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Protag.png"/> <i>I can sense a strong resolve from Haru...</i> <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="160-120.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-Haru.png"/> He’s been really showering me with presents lately… One night he even left a bouquet of roses on my pillow. But… he would have needed one of my servants to help him accomplish that, right? What a scary thought… Even worse, Takakura-san has been hurry us to get married after what happened to my father. He claims it’s because of the profit the marriage will bring to the company… ...But there has to be more to the situation than just that. Anyway, I’ll look a little deeper into Takakura-san. Perhaps he truly was pleased by my father’s death… Maybe I should start by asking the employees who are trying so desperately to win my favor… <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="167-GoroChat.jpg"/> It seems they have no evidence that can truly be called as such.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="168-RyujiChat.png"/> Well duh.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="167-GoroChat.jpg"/> However, it seems they have no intentions of changing their plans.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="169-AnnChat.png"/> They’re going to investigate at both Shujin Academy and Leblanc, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="167-GoroChat.jpg"/> Indeed.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="170-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Hm. I can understand Shujin… But why Leblanc?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="167-GoroChat.jpg"/> The key is Wakaba Isshiki.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="171-FutabaChat.jpg"/> Is it cause of my mom’s research?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="167-GoroChat.jpg"/> Correct. Her study of cognitive psience is closely connected to this case. Of that, there can be no doubt.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="171-FutabaChat.jpg"/> Then this guy’s really the mastermind behind all of this?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="167-GoroChat.jpg"/> That would be the case. There can be no mistake… The one who erased cognitive psience from this world is surely the culprit behind everything. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="170-MakotoChat.jpg"/> And getting rid of the research was to ensure only they could use its powers?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="167-GoroChat.jpg"/> How perceptive of you. Yes, that is the only logical conclusion. Both Sae-san and I were searching for clues about that research. But just as we were about to deepen our investigation, this commotion began. And to make things even more troublesome… There was only one person with strong connections to both Shujin Academy and Leblanc. And that person turned out to be the leader of the Phantom Thieves.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="172-YusukeChat.jpg"/> So the culprit had calculated all of this in advance?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="167-GoroChat.jpg"/> Heavens no. That would be impossible. This was a miracle created by the coinciding of multiple chance situations.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="173-126.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="168-RyujiChat.png"/> Y’know, shitty luck is still luck.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="174-HaruChat.jpg"/> Yes, your luck really is impressive.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="167-GoroChat.jpg"/> At any rate, that’s the current state of things. And that’s why we must obstruct the investigation at all costs.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="170-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Yes, that’s our intention.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-MorganaSquint.png"/> You really do have something special about you. I can say that with confidence now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="175-127.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-TV.jpg"/> Mr. Shido’s new party, the “United Future,” sent a motion of non-confidence against the cabinet. It was approved by a majority vote, which then led to a dissolution of the House. An election is expected to be held before the yearend, and each party has already begun preparing.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.png"/> Oh, sounds like there’s going to be an election. I wonder who’s going to win.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="176-128.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="177-Grade_Schooler_2.jpg"/> What!? Why’d you change your mind all of a sudden? Isn’t it too late to do that now? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="178-Grade_Schooler_1.jpg"/> I have to make my parents pay for throwing away my stuff. So I made a bet with them. If I make it into a better middle school, then they have to buy me everything they threw out again.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="177-Grade_Schooler_2.jpg"/> Whoa, that’s so cool! It’s like what they say on the news! Evil people deserve to be punished! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="179-129.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="180-College_Student_1.jpg"/> You’re like, completely surrounded! Get your asses out before shit goes south! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="181-College_Student_2.jpg"/> There's no way they'll turn themselves in, not with all the charges they're facing.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="180-College_Student_1.jpg"/> Pretty much pissed off all of Japan, huh? Must be scary, buuuddy!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="182-130.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="183-Office_Worker_3.jpg"/> You’ve never gotten into politics. What’s gotten into you? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Office_Worker_2.jpg"/> I saw this feature about all the recent incidents on TV. I realized we can’t rely on the ruling party. They’re the ones ruining Japan. They’re the reason why people like the Phantom Thieves run loose. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="183-Office_Worker_3.jpg"/> Would a shift in political power change anything? I can’t really imagine that happening… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="184-131.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="185-Drunk_Regular.jpg"/> Don’t worry about it. Can’t trust the ruling party anymore. Might as well let someone new take a shot. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="186-Foreign_Barker.jpg"/> Japan’s like a team of great players who don’t have a coach. It’s so strange—like people here don’t care about their own country… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="187-132.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="188-Adorable_Woman.jpg"/> What, really!? Who? I wonder if we were friends… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="189-Rural_Young_Man.jpg"/> Well, he always said he wanted to make our town better. It’s a real uphill battle, I hear, though. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="190-133.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Woman_7.jpg"/> If this gig I’ve got goes well, I’ll be able to make my debut soon. Mm-hmm, that’s right. ...What do you mean I don’t seem happy? I’m just worried about all this Phantom Thieves stuff, that’s all. I’m sure it’ll settle down soon. I’m so close to realizing my dream… I need to keep working really hard… <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="192-Ohya.png"/> The public blames the Phantom Thieves for both incidents, but something doesn’t add up… Maybe you’re rubbing off on me. But I guess a journalist’s gotta question everything. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="192-Ohya.png"/> She’s gotten so skinny, she looked almost like a stranger… She wouldn’t say anything either. I think she had a… mental shutdown, is it called?<br/>
<br/>
Oh no, that’s terrible! ...It wasn’t me. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="197-139.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="192-Ohya.png"/> Yeah. I was expecting it to be bad, but… it was still pretty jarring to see her in person. Her doctor said they found her collapsed in the street just about a year ago now. She had been wandering along the coast without any belongings, so the director’s wife took her in.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="198-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> ...Is there any hope of recovery? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="192-Ohya.png"/> ...All we can do is pray. Either way, Kayo is still a suspect, so bringing her back here would just put her in danger again… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="198-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> So we’ll never know what happened with that bureaucrat?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="192-Ohya.png"/> Not necessarily. I have her hairclip. It looks like an ordinary accessory, but it actually has a miniature camera built inside. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="199-140.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="192-Ohya.png"/> Remember that voicemail where she said she had something big? Well, it was all in the hairclip. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="198-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> So then…! <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="192-Ohya.png"/> ...It was a picture of the bureaucrat’s secret meeting. The other party must be the one behind the slush fund. And that other party… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="201-142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Again with Shido. God, I’m hearing his name all over the place. I’m sure it’s just a coincidence though.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="198-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> Shido…? You mean the politician? I can’t believe someone close to him could be so horrible…<br/>
<br/>
Gee, I’m starting to get the sneaking suspicion that this Shido fella might not be on the up-and-up!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="192-Ohya.png"/> Yup. It’s pretty clear that confidant was blackmailing the bureaucrat, and killed him for not paying up. Kayo must have managed to escape, but then ended up suffering a mental shutdown somehow… I’m not sure what could possible cause something like that though… In any case, maybe that’s why they decided to leave her alive… Heh… They underestimated her journalistic talent. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="198-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> That’s an amazing story… It’ll be a huge scoop if you’re right!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="192-Ohya.png"/> But given the current situation, it’s going to be difficult to write an article about it. I wouldn’t have Kayo’s testimony, and even if I did, I wouldn’t be able to corroborate her story. I’d get crushed if I tried to take them on without being fully prepared… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="202-143.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="203-144.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="192-Ohya.png"/> I’m gonna do whatever it takes to pursue the truth! I said I need to be fully prepared, didn’t I? It’ll just take a while.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="198-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> So then…! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="192-Ohya.png"/> I’ve resigned myself to a long battle anyway. I have her photo. Now I gotta get some solid evidence, and lay the groundwork to prove her innocence. I’m going to avenge Kayo! <i>(to Maaku)</i> ...Well then, our deal’s over. It’ll be too dangerous for you to stick around from here onward. You understand, right? The opposition won’t think twice about taking down anyone in their way. I’m sure I’ll get targeted… so to be safe, you shouldn’t come here again. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="204-145.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="205-146.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="192-Ohya.png"/> You must have nerves of steel...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="198-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> Geez… You’re really never honest with yourself, Ichiko-chan. You’re not gonna find anyone else who listens to you as encouragingly as this guy. You know that, right? It’s gonna be a long battle against a tough enemy. You should have him by your side through it. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="206-147.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="198-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> Uh-huh, sure. And what about you, kid? You’r not afraid to face the danger ahead, are you? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="207-148.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="192-Ohya.png"/> Fine. If you’re sticking your nose in this on your own free will, then there’s nothing I can do. I’ll solve this case on my own… but I appreciate having a friend who’s got my back. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="208-149.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="198-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> We don’t carry that… There’s some generic stuff in the back though… Oh, and I’ll grab an oolong tea for the kid. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="192-Ohya.png"/> Mannn… Lamest kickoff party ever! ...I guess the booze doesn’t matter though. It’s all about the company! <br/>

<br/>

Oh, never change, Ohya.<br/>
