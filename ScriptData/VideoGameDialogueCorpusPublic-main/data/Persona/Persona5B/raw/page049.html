<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-GoroSummer.png"/> May I talk to you for a moment?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-MakotoSummer.png"/> Is it about the Phantom Thieves… Akechi-kun?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-GoroSummer.png"/> ...You’re quite perceptive. I was wondering if there were any points in common between Kamoshida’s and Madarame’s cases. There have been victims, after all. The Phantom Thieves need to be pursued.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-MakotoSummer.png"/> You criticize the Phantom Thieves, yet you don’t doubt their actual existence. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-GoroSummer.png"/> Oh, you saw that show on TV. Common sense can get in the way at times when pursuing the truth. Many details become logical if I think on the premise that they do exist.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-MakotoSummer.png"/> Is this… because my sister told you to do so?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-GoroSummer.png"/> It was just a coincidence.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-MakotoSummer.png"/> Why do I get the feeling that you’re enjoying this?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-GoroSummer.png"/> ...You may be right.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-GoroSummer.png"/> Phantom thieves that use calling cards and succeed in their crime… As the so-called “Charismatic Detective,” it’d be hard for me to not see them as my rival.<br/>
<br/>
Calling yourself that is kind of the opposite of charismatic.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-MakotoSummer.png"/> You have such high self-esteem. So the Phantom Thieves are evil, and you are just?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-GoroSummer.png"/> Compared to people who manipulate others’ hearts as they see fit, I believe I’m on the side of justice. Besides, I’m only using my natural-born talents for the sake of serving the world. Don’t you think the same about yourself too?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-GoroSummer.png"/> …Oh, that’s surprising. So you’re just the good-girl type of pushover.<br/>
<br/>
Damn, son. That’s harsh.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-GoroSummer.png"/> See you later. Give Sae-san my regards.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Sojiro.png"/> You could stay until you find a place, you know. I can’t promise it’d be comfortable here though.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that was fast. Bye, Yusuke.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-YusukeCollarless.png"/> Thank you, but I’ll return to the dorms. I realized something after talking with everyone last night. Perhaps it’s due to my upbringing, but I don’t know anything of the world, let alone other people. If I’m to depict people in my art, I need to learn more about them; I must interact with them more. I’ll return to the dorms… and start over by talking with the people closest to me.<br/>
<br/>
I thought everyone was shunning you because of Madarame?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Sojiro.png"/> I see. Good on you for realizing that yourself.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-YusukeCollarless.png"/> There’s no need to exaggerate. May I come again sometime to enjoy your coffee?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Sojiro.png"/> My doors are always open.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-YusukeCollarless.png"/> Maaku’s been through a lot too, from what I’ve heard… Are you related to him?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Sojiro.png"/> Huh? Oh… How would I describe it… We’re just acquaintances. Not family or anything.<br/>
<br/>
Aww, I thought we’d bonded.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-YusukeCollarless.png"/> I may be overstepping my bounds, but why did you decide to take him in?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Sojiro.png"/> My reason, huh… Probably because… he reminds me of my old self.<br/>
<br/>
Awwwwwwww.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-YusukeCollarless.png"/> That’s all?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Sojiro.png"/> Doesn’t take much when someone takes consideration on someone else. Your art instructor-- Um, “former” art instructor. He must’ve felt something for you too, besides just stealing your talents.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-YusukeCollarless.png"/> Truth be told… I cannot hate him from the depths of my heart either. I should probably get going...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-YusukeCollarless.png"/> Even if I kept it at the dorms, it’d only be met with skepticism. I doubt it would want that. Adding a hint of color to an otherwise ordinary day… I’m sure my mother would’ve done the same.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Sojiro.png"/> ...I see. I’ll hold onto it for you then.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-YusukeCollarless.png"/> Thank you for the coffee.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-011.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Morgana.png"/> That’s the first thing you have to say to me…? You guys sure do eat a lot… That reminds me, I haven’t seen Yusuke around. Maybe he went downstairs?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
You’re not my dad.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Sojiro.png"/> That kid ended up going back to his dorms.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-014.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Sojiro.png"/> Don’t be ridiculous. I’d never let go of a beauty like this. This painting is amazing. Not only is the mother stunning, but the expression on her face… The regulars will probably freak out when they see it in here. Still… I feel like I’ve seen it somewhere. It’s a bit different from how I remember it, though.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate that Sojiro kind of knows about Madarame (mostly through Yusuke), but is otherwise so out of touch he can’t recognize the fucking Mona Lisa, which has been all over the news the last week, by sight.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Sojiro.png"/> Well… If you’re up for the day, go on and get dressed. I opened shop hours ago, so go take the cat out somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Apologies for leaving so quietly, but your rest seemed peaceful. After a great deal of inner struggle, I have decided to return to the dormitories. Furthermore, I’ve entrusted the “Sayuri” to your protector, Sojiro. That painting should no longer exist in reality… but it is truly what my mother painted. I am simply satisfied that we were able to obtain it. And it was all because of you guys. I cannot thank you enough. PS, I still believe porridge is the best way to end a hot pot.<br/>
<br/>
That’s Yusuke, all right. Udon or death!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-018.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-RyujiChat.png"/> There’s some kinda thread on there looking for info about burglars using the Phantom Thieves name. Sounds pretty lame to me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-AnnChat.png"/> Oh, I saw that too. They target restaurants, right? I actually found a really interesting post on there. “My brother has suddenly started acting violent towards everyone. I might end up getting killed at this rate… I wonder if it’s because he got caught up with all those weird people in Shibuya.”<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-RyujiChat.png"/> You think he means those burglars when he’s talking about them “weird people”?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-YusukeChat.jpg"/> It may be too soon to assume that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-AnnChat.png"/> The post said he started spending a bunch of money lately, too… Isn’t that kind of suspicious?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-AnnChat.png"/> I thought you’d say that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Although how exactly will we go about investigating?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-AnnChat.png"/> We’ll go to Shibuya in the middle of the night and catch them red-handed! No way. The police’d totally nab us if we were out that late.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Morgana.png"/> Plus it would be bad if the chief knew you were out in the middle of the night.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Hm, if they target restaurants… Aha! What if we drew them to Leblanc?<br/>
<br/>
FIRE YUSUKE<br/>
<br/>
OUT OF A CANNON<br/>
<br/>
INTO THE SUN<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-RyujiChat.png"/> What!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Morgana.png"/> There’s no way… Who would go after a shop like this?<br/>
<br/>
Not the point, Morgana!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-RyujiChat.png"/> Yup. I mean, you’d get kicked outta Leblanc if we failed.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Oh, I suppose I left the “Sayuri” there as well. I had forgotten.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-RyujiChat.png"/> How’d you forget something that important!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-AnnChat.png"/> Either way… I don’t really want more thieves to be posing as us in the future. I wish there was some way we could make an example of these ones...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-YusukeChat.jpg"/> At the moment, our lack of info means we will just have to wait. We can continue searching for more information wherever possible, though.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-AnnChat.png"/> Yeah.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-RyujiChat.png"/> I’m gonna try looking for stuff too!<br/>
<br/>
So, nothing to do but wait, the ever-present Persona refrain.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-TV.jpg"/> Since the year started, scam victims have been on the rise, mainly in the Tokyo metro area. A massive mafia group is rumored to be behind these scam incidents, but…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Morgana.png"/> A mafia group? Huh. I wonder who they might be.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Haughty.png"/> This just shows that many fail to truly understand what is art. Did you see past Madarame’s lies?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Haughty.png"/> I understand if you feel art is beyond you, but it’s good to take an interest in the finer things. That said, there is no depth to Madarame’s work. It is cheap and base, like instant coffee. Don’t fret if these concepts are difficult to grasp. Art is deep and complex… like this coffee.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-025.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Sojiro.png"/> Yeah, right. Well, you look like you’re on good terms. As long as you don’t cause problems, it’s fine.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-AnnTankTop.png"/> OK! Where should we go? Somewhere popular would be nice!<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-AnnTankTop.png"/> Honestly… it was crazy how much my stomach expanded last time. But I’ve reflected on my actions… and I won’t make the same mistake again! But, Maaku… can you keep an eye on me? I think as long as you do, my resolve won’t crumble.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Protag.png"/> *nods*<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-AnnTankTop.png"/> Well then, let’s get eating. The order you eat things seems important. Let’s start with the stuff that digests quickly...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-AnnTankTop.png"/> No wonder this place is expensive… I’m amazed they give out stuff like this! ...I feel like I’d just eat from it nonstop if I kept it at my house… Can you take it?<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Well that’s sudden.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-RyujiChat.png"/> Well after what that guy said, sitting around doing nothing just pisses me off!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-AnnChat.png"/> You’re talking about Akechi-kun, right? I know how you feel.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-AnnChat.png"/> But he did mention that the police are starting to mobilize… Either way, I don’t think we should leave Akechi-kun be.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-YusukeChat.jpg"/> This is the perfect time to meet and discuss what our strategy should be going forward. Let us gather at the hideout tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
How the hell did I lug this thing home? And where did I get all the chocolate?<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Rocker.jpg"/> That’s why I’ve poured my soul into this song—to help restore our hope. I give you… “Fake Glory”! Fake shake, fake/Shake, fake, shake/Fake one, if you want fame/You gotta deceive yourself/Fake two, if you want skills/You gotta steal ‘em from others/Fake three, if you want glory/You gotta trick your very soul/Truth, lie, fake with a shake/My future is an unknown fate/ Thanks, bay-bee!

<br/>

We should probably hang out with Mishima now that we can again, since we haven’t done it in a while. I guess.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-MishimaGreen.png"/> Oh yeah! As your strategic image management rep, I thought I should come up with more ways to help you. Do you have time today?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Protag.png"/> &gt;Hang out with him<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-MishimaGreen.png"/> How does the diner sound to you? Come on.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-MishimaGreen.png"/> All thieves are supposed to have some special ladies, right?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-MishimaGreen.png"/> Wait, really…? Phantom thieves are supposed to steal girls’ hearts! Everyone knows that! Basically, I met some cool girls on the Phan-Site, and we thought it’d be fun to do an in-person meet-up. Oh, that reminds me, they think we’re just part of the Phandom. I made up this whole story about how we stumbled on the Phan-Site one day, so let’s stick to that. Don’t spill the beans, OK?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-047.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-MishimaGreen.png"/> Either way, you should be excited about this! Mingling with your loyal supporters is a noble cause indeed! Plus, remember how I said I’d help publicize the Phantom Thieves? This is just the beginning!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-MishimaGreen.png"/> Though to be honest, I’ve never actually met someone from online in person… I wonder if I’ll be able to do it right… I did lots of research though. I know all about footing the bill and buying desserts for the girl. Apparently if things go well, you might even t-t-take her home…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Let’s not get ahead of ourselves, Mishima.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-MishimaGreen.png"/> It’s way past our meeting time...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-MishimaGreen.png"/> About our meet-up… You’re still at home!? And what about your friend…? Oh, um… yeah. Uh-huh… No, we’ll be waiting here...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-MishimaGreen.png"/> Wait, was that a train announcement? I could swear I just heard someone say “Shibuya” over a loudspeaker… Are you close by… Huh? Oh, no! I’m not calling you a liar… OK… Yeah… Maybe next time...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-MishimaGreen.png"/> Ahaha… *sigh* It seemed like they were really into the idea on the forum...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-MishimaGreen.png"/> I was so busy with all the new forum posts, I didn’t have time to really vet them too much.<br/>
<br/>

Ixnay, Mishima. We have enough problems with Ryuji constantly spouting off about it.<br/>

Because you’re boring me to death.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-GoroSummer.png"/> Did you stay up too late? Are you all right? ...Ah, I do like that response. It’s honest, and it keeps the conversation from dragging. ...I’ve been getting interviewed a lot lately, so I’ve been wondering how to answer such questions… I suppose it is best to simply be yourself and say what you think. You’ve given me much to consider. If it isn’t too much trouble, may I speak with you again sometime?<br/>
<br/>
If I have time, maybe.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Ushimaru.png"/> But what I gave them was a bona fide Japanese bank note. Don’t tell me young people these days don’t know who Hirobumi Ito is. I shudder to think that these will be the people shouldering Japan’s economy… I hope you all know your stuff. Here’s a quiz just to make sure. Hey, Hamiru. Paper money is issued by the Bank of Japan, but who issues the coins?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Ushimaru.png"/> That’s right. Unlike paper money, coins are issued by the government. Originally, the government made both coins and paper money. However, with the ability to make as much money as they wanted, the economy fell into chaos. An independent organization—namely the Bank of Japan—has been tasked with printing paper money since.<br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Knowledge +1</b>.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Ushimaru.png"/> Coins, which don’t have as much of an effect on the economy, are still produced by the government. You simply can’t trust a moron to look after your finances. The best they can manage is pocket change.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Morgana.png"/> Being able to get as much money as you want, whenever you want it… I hope the next Palace is somewhere awesome like that...<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-YusukeBlue.png"/> A recording seems to be insufficient evidence though. And even with that, there’s no way they could prove our methods.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-AnnSummer.png"/> Considering who we’re dealing with, I think it might be a trap.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Morgana.png"/> Regardless, Maaku would be in real trouble. He’s on probation, after all.<br/>
