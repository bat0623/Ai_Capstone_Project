<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-TV.jpg"/> Now for today’s Train News. Today’s headlines are… “Shady Drug Deals in Shibuya!” Is this the same organization behind both this and the extortions? Alongside the phishing scams that have been on the rise, this may be their source of funding. “Restaurant Factory Fire!” A worker from the restaurant giant Haneruya was arrested for arson. Though he admits to the charges, he claims to not know why he did it. This industry is raising eyebrows.<br/>
<br/>
Jeez, more food service nonsense?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Morgana.png"/> Oh yeah, something weird happened in food service before, right? Some employee cooking naked… With all these extortions and scams… this world’s really messed up.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Boy_5.jpg"/> What was that all about?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Boy_6.jpg"/> I hear her older sister’s involved with the investigation. Maybe she’s just trying to play detective, too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Boy_5.jpg"/> Are you kidding me? I can’t handle a student council president with no focus. She and the principal can both get lost.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-AnnSummer.png"/> There sure are a lot of high schoolers during the day. They must be targeting them somehow.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-YusukeBlue.png"/> It will be quite difficult to figure out how given the number of people around though.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-RyujiSummer.png"/> Right! We’re gonna grab ‘em by the tail!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-AnnSummer.png"/> As we discussed yesterday, you should head over to Central Street, Maaku.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-RyujiSummer.png"/> Sweet, let’s get goin’! Lemme know if you find any shady people!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Morgana.png"/> We might end up running into the mafia. Be ready for anything!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-MakotoSummer.png"/> I hope something comes of it. I’ll be counting on you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Morgana.png"/> Is she following us? Nah, that can’t be.<br/>
<br/>
<i>What.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Cop.jpg"/> They appear and disappear as they please… Not only that, but they blend in with normal teenagers...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Cop_3.jpg"/> Stop complaining! If we don’t try getting information, people will say the police are useless! The media are already on our case, and the higher-ups aren’t doing a thing… This is bad for morale...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Move a little further down the street, and we’re automatically pulled into this scene.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Menacing_Man.jpg"/> We’re having a special sale just over there. How ‘bout you go take a peek?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Pierced_Man.jpg"/> We ordered way too much, so I have a ton left over. My boss’ll kill me if I go back to him with all these extras. Look, I’ll sell ‘em to you for cheap. Whaddya say?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Boy_9.jpg"/> What should we do?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Boy_11.jpg"/> It depends on the price, wouldn’t you say?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-010.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Pierced_Man.jpg"/> Well that’s disappointing. Come back if you change your mind.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Menacing_Man.jpg"/> Really? The shop’s right over there. Just go take a look.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Morgana.png"/> It seems like some kind of sale. You probably shouldn’t bother.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, the sketchiest sale ever.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-012.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Homeless_Man_2.jpg"/> Hm? Is that supposed to be some kinda password? I have no idea what you’re talking about. I haven’t been here long. Try talking to someone else.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Homeless_Man_2.jpg"/> That ain’t so easy… I only know one guy around here… Sometimes I see him in the alley across the way, but I don’t think he’s there today. He might be near the station. Go there if you wanna see him.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Morgana.png"/> Hm, maybe this other person would know something…? Apparently he’s near the train station, so let’s go take a look over there.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Is she keeping an eye on us?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-AnnChat.png"/> Maybe. I guess she’s curious about all of this.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-RyujiChat.png"/> Well let’s just ignore her if she’s not getting in our way. More importantly, how’re things on your guys’ end?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-AnnChat.png"/> Nothing so far. I’m going to try staking out the underground walkway.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-RyujiChat.png"/> Then I’ll check around the Inogami Line. I guess I’ll get there from the underground.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-YusukeChat.jpg"/> I will gather some more intel in the underground shopping mall as well. Please continue on your end, Maaku.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Morgana.png"/> Everyone’s really going about this seriously. They’re definitely worth of being phantom thieves. We can’t fall behind either. Let’s look for that homeless man.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-016.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-MakotoSummer.png"/> Hm…? You’re trying to find a homeless person? That’s a good idea. They would know a lot about what goes on in this town. I haven’t seen any here, but I would bet there are some in the underground area...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Morgana.png"/> Underground… I don’t like the idea of it, but we should go check it out.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Sure enough, it’s the homeless guy we chat with from time to time.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Homeless_Man.jpg"/> A part-time job…? You’re not talking about some ordinary job, huh? Take my advice: Don’t do it. They’ll squeeze every last penny out of you with threats and extortion. Some of my friends have fallen victim to their schemes… That mafia is evil, I tell you.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Homeless_Man.jpg"/> It’s easy to say that, but none of them have places to go… Just don’t go anywhere near that mafia. But just so you know who to avoid, I’ll teach you how to tell them apart from normal people. They use some weird phrases. Code words, you know. That’s how they communicate with each other. Anyway, watch out if you hear any of that stuff. They’ll try to come for you even during the day. They’re relentless when it comes to targeting teens.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Ah, so you’ve grasped something already. As to be expected of someone like you, Maaku.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-AnnChat.png"/> Why don’t we just go over the intel we’ve gathered so far?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-RyujiChat.png"/> I’ll start. Supposedly some guy near the accessway talking about some kinda “strong drugs.” I’m not counting on anything, but I’ll go check it out.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-AnnChat.png"/> As for me, I heard about someone soliciting a “high-paying job” in the station plaza. Apparently they’re mostly targeting girls. I’ll go see what it’s about.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-YusukeChat.jpg"/> On my end, I heard there are people saying strange things in the back alley near the arcade. Something about ice and vegetables, and something about snow tomorrow… I will go observe, just in case. The arcade is on Central Street, correct?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Morgana.png"/> All right, we should do what we can to help them out. I have no idea which of these leads are real. Try going to the most suspicious-sounding place.<br/>
<br/>
Let’s think this through. Despite Ryuji and Ann’s leads sounding more outright suspicious, they don’t have any elements of code words, leading us to conclude it’s almost certainly Yusuke’s lead that’s the correct one. That said, we should at least check out those other two first <s>because they might be funny.</s><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-RyujiSummer.png"/> Uhhh… Go down those stairs, then turn left. Be careful, granny.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Old_Woman.jpg"/> Oh, Shibuya is so complicated. These bones don’t move like they used to either. How troubling.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-RyujiSummer.png"/> Arghhh, c’mon...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-RyujiSummer.png"/> Sorry, my lead didn’t end up bein’ anything. That dude at the stairs… Pretty misleadin’, huh? Sheesh… Oh, what about Ann and Yusuke? You should go check on ‘em. Hey, granny, you OK? You’re lookin’ pretty shaky, so I don’t mind givin’ you a hand.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-RyujiSummer.png"/> Uh, thanks. I dunno what I’m even doin’ here though…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Morgana.png"/> He said his lead didn’t amount to anything. We should leave this area to him, OK? Come on, let’s go see Lady Ann and Yusuke.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Man_5.jpg"/> I’ve heard it’s super effective. Even the most barren deserts will become lush forests of hair…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Morgana.png"/> So that’s who Ryuji was talking about. Lush forests… I don’t really want to know. I guess I can see how you’d mistake him for what we want though.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-029.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I’ll do whatever! Squat cobbler, you name it!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Lighthearted_Scout.jpg"/> Huh? You… want to be in one of our videos? I guess I can’t say there’s no demand… but our company only hires girls. Sorry.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Morgana.png"/> ...Be in a video? What kind of job is that? Though I guess that doesn’t have anything to do with drugs. It must not be him.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-AnnSummer.png"/> Look, someone’s asking about a video shoot over by the train… but I guess that’s for models? In any case, they’re not here. Go try seeing what Ryuji and Yusuke have.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Cop.jpg"/> Arcade…? You’re a high school student, aren’t you? You’d better not be looking for trouble. All kinds of shady activity happens at arcades.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-YusukeBlue.png"/> What are you talking about? It’s nothing more than a place you go to play games...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This must be the alley Yusuke was referring to.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-035.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-036.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-MakotoSummer.png"/> Well… you aren’t wrong about that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-038.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-MakotoSummer.png"/> It seems we didn’t have to look very hard in the end.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Man_Trying_To_Look_Cool.jpg"/> You’re high schoolers, yeah? Don’t you want something more than just your allowances?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-MakotoSummer.png"/> Hm… by delivery, do you mean that of suspicious materials?<br/>
<br/>
Um, what are you doing?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Man_Trying_To_Look_Cool.jpg"/> Heh, you’re a funny girl.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-MakotoSummer.png"/> So you won’t answer me? Then I was right...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Man_Trying_To_Look_Cool.jpg"/> What’s up with you anyways? Why’re you asking all these questions, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-MakotoSummer.png"/> Oh…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Man_Trying_To_Look_Cool.jpg"/> Anyways, I can’t hang. Seeya!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-MakotoSummer.png"/> U-Um, if you don’t want to deal with us, we could always go see your boss ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
No seriously, what the hell are you doing?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Man_Trying_To_Look_Cool.jpg"/> You’re really gonna say that, knowing who he is? Heh, no way I believe that. Welp, I’m outta here. You guys are annoying me.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-043.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-MakotoSummer.png"/> I think we should get some proof before we do that. I tried to trick him into saying something, but he dodged all the traps I was laying down.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, real great attempt there. Not only did you not learn anything, you almost got your ass kicked.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-MakotoSummer.png"/> By the way… thanks for standing up for me. I’m going to go now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Morgana.png"/> No wonder the police are having trouble catching him. Anyway, you have some serious guts. You didn’t back down at all against that hooligan. Though we still didn’t end up with any new information… Let’s stop here for today.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-AnnChat.png"/> That would be best. We did ask tons of people, so there’s a chance we’re being followed.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Just to be safe, we should refrain from doing anything to make ourselves stand out. The sun will be setting soon, so let us disband for today and report on our findings tomorrow.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-AnnChat.png"/> Why don’t we meet at karaoke tomorrow? We can talk in private, and it’ll be cheap after school.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Ah, that must be what they call hustle hour.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-RyujiChat.png"/> Dude, it’s muscle hour. Wait, is that wrong too?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-AnnChat.png"/> Um, hello? Happy hour. Muscle hour just sounds sweaty… Anyway, see you guys at karaoke tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-MakotoSummer.png"/> Thanks. For earlier.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-MakotoSummer.png"/> ...I wanted to apologize. I got a hold of your number without asking you, so… I realize I’m apologizing after the fact, but… It just didn’t feel right, keeping it from you, so… ...That’s all. Bye.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Sojiro.png"/> Speaking of, some girl called looking for you around noon. Said she’s the class president. Said she’s got something that belongs to you. She seemed to know you, so I gave her your number.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Morgana.png"/> She must’ve looked up Leblanc’s address trying to contact you. That Niijima sure is thorough! Then again, she called you just to apologize… It’s a bit weird, but maybe she’s not so bad after all.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-TV.jpg"/> An employee was arrested, but claims to be unable to recall any details of the crime. When questioned about his motive, the employee insisted he did not know what came over him. Incidents with suspects whose motives are unclear have been happening often in the restaurant industry…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Morgana.png"/> It’s weird that they don’t remember. How is anyone supposed to prevent these weird crimes?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Sojiro.png"/> Are you helping out today?<br/>
<br/>
We can finally rank up, so let’s hang out with him.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Protag.png"/> &gt;Help him out<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Sojiro.png"/> I’ll teach you how to make good coffee. Its taste all depends on you though.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Sojiro.png"/> These beans are Colombian, a medium-fine city roast. Oh, and don’t let the water boil too much. ...You’re gonna be fine. I’ll be here the whole time.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Sojiro.png"/> ...Not bad. Though I guess anyone can do something as simple as just brewing it. Making a blend, on the other hand, is a different story. Mixing beans at random won’t do you any good. That’s because the acidity and the flavor profile all depend on the bean ratio. Pretty deep, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-055.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Sojiro.png"/> If you’re really that interested, feel free to try out whatever combinations you want to. ...Oh, but hands off the expensive beans, got it? Next up is the curry. There’s something special about its flavor. The truth is, a scientific genius actually came up with the perfect spice combo to complement my coffee.<br/>
<br/>
Suuuuure they did.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Sojiro.png"/> Something about the quantification of taste… There’s no formula for flavor, but it IS pretty damn good. Anyhow, we don’t make compromises when it comes to food service. Our stuff’s gotta wow the customers. This is a tiny shop, after all. Self-satisfaction is the only thing that keeps me going.<br/>
<br/>
The front door opens.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Un.jpg"/> Oh, no need to hide it, Sakura-san! You must have saved plenty from your time working in the government. Aren’t you taking care of that employee right there too, for nothing more than charity? I wish you’d show me the same kindness you show others.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Sojiro.png"/> If you’re not planning on buying anything, can you please leave? I’m expecting a phone call, so I don’t have time to chat with you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Un.jpg"/> I don’t mind if you take the call in front of me. I can talk to your little friend here in the meantime. So, should we keep talking until your call comes in? Or would that be too inconvenient for you?<br/>

He might try and drop by when I’m not around. ...That man is an old acquaintance of mine who’s short on cash right now. Looks pretty friendly, yeah? Don’t let him fool you—It’s all an act.

Curry restores 20 SP for all allies, but you can only make it on certain dates, and it still consumes time. Considering how packed our nights already are, it’s not really worth it, especially once we get those SP Adhesive 3s from Takemi. Also, it counts as a “food” item and can’t be used in battle.<br/>
