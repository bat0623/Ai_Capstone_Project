<br/>

<br/>
God, everyone’s on my case about this Palace shit just because we’re all going to jail if we don’t do it. Relaaaaaaaaax.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Yusuke.png"/> I see. I won’t press you… However, our opponent is serious too. We have to do something. We can’t fail this no matter what. Please bear that in mind. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Ushimaru.png"/> What? You’re asking if the Phantom Thieves would be given a trial if they get caught? Of course they would. All they would need to do is prove a link between the deaths and their activities. In short, they would be put on trial for murder. Hey, Hamiru. Do you know what age you have to be in order to listen in on a trial? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Ushimaru.png"/> That’s right. There’s no age restriction to watch trials. They’re open to the public, save for juvenile crimes. In other words, you can go see one yourselves. Well, I imagine the visitors seats will be full if the Phantom Thieves were put to trial. Everyone is dying to know who exactly the culprits are and how they did it. <br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Knowledge +1</b>.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Ushimaru.png"/> However, their method and how it connects to the murder must be proven in order to sentence them. The methods the Phantom Thieves use far exceed human knowledge. I’d imagine in order to prove it, they’d have to catch them in the act. Hmm… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Morgana.png"/> ……<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-010.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> At a time like this…? I guess if that’s really what you want to do… Is this a part of your grand strategy? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> Hm. I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to take things a little slower. Um, I need some help with a matter involving Eiko. Are you free? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> Thank you. It’ll be nice to have you with me. Um, I want to dig up some dirt regarding Eiko’s boyfriend Tsukasa before we confront her about him. I was thinking of asking around the red-light district for info. Shall we head over there? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> However, we’ll need solid proof of what he’s doing if we’re going to convince Eiko. I believe some of the promoters around here may know something. As my father always said, finding evidence takes serious legwork. <br/>
<br/>
So, this is a unique event among this game’s Confidants, where we have to actually walk around with our partner and talk to NPCs. It’s brief, but there’s nothing else like this in the game, so it’s worth pointing out. <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Unfriendly_Promoter.jpg"/> Tch… You wanna sabotage our business? I’d gladly talk some more out back if you want. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> W-We should get out of here… I think it would be better if we asked someone else… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Friendly_Promoter.jpg"/> Wait… are you high schoolers? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Friendly_Promoter.jpg"/> Heh, what a good joke. You’re exactly the kind of person we like. Come right this way. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Friendly_Promoter.jpg"/> Tsukasa? Ohhh, is he a host or something? Sorry, but I’d never promote for a host club. Are you pranking me? Come on, I can’t talk to you forever. You understand? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> ...I take it he doesn’t know anything. We should try to look elsewhere. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Light-hearted_Promoter.jpg"/> For you, the glasses discount, the curly hair discount, the slouch discount, the couples discount… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Light-hearted_Promoter.jpg"/> Tsukasa? Sorry, we don’t have a Tsukasa discount. Mannn, it took a ton of effort to answer your question. You’ll come to my club to make up for it, right? C’monnn, you’ll get tons of discounts! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> Don’t follow him! We need to work! ...I’m a little worried though. I wonder if anyone actually has info… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Irritated_Promoter.jpg"/> ...You have money though? You seem like a poor young kid.<br/>
<br/>
I have like 600k on me, shithead.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Irritated_Promoter.jpg"/> Tsukasa? You bastard… You a friend of his!? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Irritated_Promoter.jpg"/> He’s usin’ the sake bottle trick…? Lemme make it clear for you: Get that girl outta there. Tsukasa’s known for wreckin’ lives. He “breaks a sake bottle,” then ends up sellin’ the girls to pay it back. Same thing happened to one of my friends… Dammit! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> We have proof now. ...Come on, it’s almost time for Eiko’s shift to end. Let’s wait for her in front of the shop. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
If her shift was about to end, why did she walk in from the right side of the screen instead of from the actual building? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> Eiko… Your “boyfriend” is infamous around here for tricking girls into debt, then forcing them to sell themselves. Moreover, he’s probably doing it in conjunction with a criminal gang. You need to get out of there. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Eiko.jpg"/> ...You seriously came all the way here to tell me that? Ugh, get out of here, Makoto! I’ve had enough of your lying bullshit! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> I have testimony from one of the promoters in the area. You’re not the first girl Tsukasa has lied to about a “broken sake bottle.” He doesn’t ask for much at first, but the interest piles up. Eventually he’ll ask you to sell your body for money. Please, reconsider this relationship. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Eiko.jpg"/> I already have a date planned with him for today. We’re gonna stop by his club. So stay outta my way!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Tsukasa.jpg"/> I came a little late after seein’ your text, but I guess you’re already here… Heyo, I know these guys. Wanna hop on over to my club with us? It’s gonna be a total blast! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Eiko.jpg"/> They were saying some bad stuff about you, honey. Like how you get girls into debt and then force ‘em to sell themselves… They’re lying to me, right? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Tsukasa.jpg"/> Huh? You believe that crap? Listen to me: Nothing like that’s happenin’ here. I’d never lie to you, princess. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> It’s always “princess” with you. Why don’t you ever call her by her real name, Tsukasa? Or are there too many princesses in your life to remember? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Tsukasa.jpg"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Eiko.jpg"/> Tsukasa…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Tsukasa.jpg"/> Hahaha, what’re you freakin’ out for? You just texted me, remember? I could never forget you, Makoto.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh shiiiiiiiit<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> I knew it. I’m the one who texted you. “I’ll b 5 mins late 2day, bb.” I even added tons of emojis at the end to make sure it seemed like Eiko. Admit it. Every girl you get money from is your princess, right? You can’t even remember names anymore. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> Don’t you see, Eiko? This is who your “boyfriend” really is!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Eiko.jpg"/> B-But… you tricked him! What would you know about love, huh? Tsukasa’s all I have! Just leave me alone, bitch! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Slap.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
Damn, girl!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> You already know the truth, you just don’t want to believe it! Stop lying to yourself! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Eiko.jpg"/> Nobody else asks me about my day, or how work is going… Nobody else treats me like I’m special… A perfect girl who lives up to everyone’s expectations could never know how I feel! Stop trying to feed me your honor student bullshit! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> ...This has nothing to do with being an honor student. I just can’t rest knowing there’s such evil in the world! And I damn sure won’t keep quiet while my friend has her life ruined! <i>(to Tsukasa)</i> As for you… apologize to Eiko! And stay away from her from now on!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Tsukasa.jpg"/> Huh? You’re really startin’ to annoy me with this shit, you bitch…! Don’t think I’ll go easy on you ‘cause you’re a chick. I’m gonna teach you a lesson you won’t forget.<br/>
<br/>
And the facade drops. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-038.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Tsukasa.jpg"/> Wh-What? Dammit… I’ll remember this!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Apparently he doesn’t remember it, because that dude runs straight out of the game never to be heard from again. We’re just gonna let that dude go? No change of heart? He’s probably gonna do this again, you know. ...Whatever.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Eiko.jpg"/> Ugh… This sucks! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-042.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Busy_Young_Man.jpg"/> Was that girl fighting with a host?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Office_Worker.jpg"/> They were really going at it…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-044.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> Eiko… ……<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-047.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh hey, we ended up here. Thought this place wasn’t open during the day. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-049.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> You know, I have a bad habit of acting in the moment. I can’t help but get swept up in emotion… That’s why I always have to take extra care to keep myself composed. My father was the same way… That’s not the proper way to act though. There’s no telling what would have happened if you hadn’t stepped in. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> How did you ever find somewhere like this…? You know so much. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-052.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> It’s hard to believe you’re really a high schooler. You have so much more life experience than me… Honestly, spending time with you and getting to know Eiko has given me a great deal to think about. There’s so much you can miss by living with your head buried between the pages of a book… I thought I knew how the world worked… but the more time I spent with you guys, the more I realized how naive I was. I see now that there are some things I need other people to teach me. ...Do you remember how Eiko said I would flunk a test about love? Well, um… I don’t know how to study that subject.<br/>
<br/>
God, you’re a nerd.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> ...What should I do, Maaku-kun? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Protag.png"/> <i>I should choose my words carefully...</i><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> I can’t learn about romance by myself...<br/>
<br/>
Will he pick up on the subtle signs here…?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
NOPE, REJECTED.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> People say those kinds of things are destiny anyway, so I probably shouldn’t worry myself over it. And besides, I should at least try to focus on my schoolwork right now. Let’s work hard to achieve our goals together, Maaku-kun. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Protag.png"/> <i>I can sense a strong bond of friendship from Makoto...</i><br/>
<br/>
And that’s all it’ll ever be.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> It’s like a nice spritz of lemon in the air. Makes me think back to when I was just a wee girl...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto.png"/> R-Right. Well, we should be going… Thank you again for today. I’ll see you later… <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Chihaya.png"/> The chairman turned himself in! It’s even shown up on the news! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-068.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Chihaya.png"/> It all happened so suddenly too. He confessed all of his crimes… The police came to question me after that, but they ultimately concluded that I’m innocent. Apparently the chairman took full responsibility for the ADP and admitted he was brainwashing all of its members. Oh, and speaking of members, some of them said they’ve stopped using the Holy Stones because of my advice. It was all the clients you sat in with, Hamiru-san! You know, I never saw this as a possible outcome in my readings. Not only have the fates of the ADP members improved, but even my own has begun to shift… It’s almost like this curse that’s followed me ever since the villagers called me a monster… has passed. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-070.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Chihaya.png"/> Right, I remember. Strong conviction is the only way to change fate. That reminds me, my readings told me I would accomplish my objective with the aid of the Trickster… But I’m not sure what exactly that was supposed to mean… It’s such a mystery… That aside, the ADP is finished. Nobody else will be deceived. Oh, I just realized something… Remember how I told you how the chairman knew I was a runaway? Well, I was wandering around te city with luggage at my side. Anyone could have figured that out, huh…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Protag.png"/> *nods*<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-072.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Chihaya.png"/> I know how fragile I was back then… but it’s still embarrassing to think I let myself believe he was a psychic! But… I guess some men are good at knowing when a woman is vulnerable. Are you one of those men, Hamiru-san…?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I don’t what you’re trying to say, and I vehemently deny it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Chihaya.png"/> The truth is, there’s actually something else besides the chairman that I want to talk to you about. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Chihaya.png"/> This is so embarrassing… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Protag.png"/> <u>Hmm, what an odd question. While I find the strange sexual undertones of my relationship with my homeroom teacher to be more than a little revolting, this isn’t a topic I have considered thoroughly. However, now that I set my mind to it, I find that there’s something… liberating about the idea of being with someone with more life experience than myself, however marginal the difference. It should also be noted that we as a people normalize May-December romances of the female/male persuasion, yet the opposite has been thoroughly stigmatized. I suppose there’s no harm in working to reverse that unsightly trend, now is there? So I must say that yes, if the opportunity arose I would not necessarily cast aside the possibility of dating outside of my age bracket. At least, once I come of age. I’m still seventeen, I’ll have you know, and it wouldn’t be right to begin such a relationship until then. But, this is all strictly hypothetical and I have absolutely no idea why you would ask such a question. Also, girls my age have cooties.</u><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Jim.jpg"/> Shido leads the United Future movement, right? He was right—if we’d taken the Phantom Thieves seriously from the start, they’d be behind bars by now. Which’ll come first, do you think? Regime change or the apprehension of the Phantom Thieves? <br/>

<br/>
Oh shit, it’s legendary hero of <i>Journey to the West</i> Sun Wukong! Wukong, also known as Seiten Taisei, is the main protagonist of that famous story. Seiten Taisei itself is a Japanese translation of the Chinese name “Qitian Dasheng” (which should be familiar for you FFXIV players this patch), a title Wukong gave to himself meaning “Equaling Heaven Great Sage.” He is also known as Son Gokuu. No, really. Journey to the West inspired a whole lot of OG Dragon Ball.<br/>
<br/>
I can’t tell you much about the character of Seiten Taisei because this summary of his deeds is very long, but he got into a ton of mischief, wreaking havoc until Buddha imprisoned him under a mountain, where he remained until being saved by a monk named Xuanzang. <br/>
<br/>
There’s a subtle link between Ryuji, Captain Kidd, and Seiten Taisei, and extra credit goes to the first person to tell me what it is.<br/>

When we get our party’s ascended Personas, they learn an Evade skill that will triple their Evasion against their weaknesses. We slot in Evade Wind for Bad Beat.<br/>

<br/>

I accepted that I was a zero… That my existence was meaningless. But I’ve learned. I may not be able to change the world, but I can change myself. Whether I sulk about my inability to do anything, or hang my head high and look to the future… My perception shapes the boundaries of my world. It all comes down to what’s inside my heart.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Protag.png"/> *nods*<br/>
<br/>
Wow, man. That was almost deep.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="152-Mishima.png"/> I might still mess up every so often, but as long as you’re here, I’ll be able to stand up again. So I may not be the best person around, but you can feel free to rely on me at least sometimes! And… no matter what the world says, I’ll be rooting for you… just like you were for me!<br/>

<br/>
Mishima is… complicated. Not a great person, but ultimately not a terrible one either. Probably one of the most realistically-written characters in the game, including all the ways in which he’s kind of shitty. He’s voiced by Sean Chiplock, who voiced Subaru in Re: Zero, Santa in that remake of 999, Revali in Breath of the Wild, and he was also Replacement Liam O’Brien in SMTIV: Apocalypse.<br/>

We should save that for after I get all my book royalties! Heheh, you’d better be looking forward to it! <br/>
<br/>
Bye, Mishima. You were… interesting.
