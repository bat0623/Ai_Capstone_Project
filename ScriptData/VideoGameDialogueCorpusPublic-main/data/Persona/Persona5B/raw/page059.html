	<b>Part 58: 6/25: I Wish I Was An Only Child</b><br/><br/>
Well, let’s get back to it, I guess. I managed to fix the portraits, at least, and hopefully there isn’t much in the way of further obstruction from Ari.<br/>
<br/>
<i>”I got bored during this part so instead of writing I just added a bunch of stuff I thought was cool to the pictures”</i><br/>
<br/>
That doesn’t sound too bad, I guess.<br/>

<br/>
There’s a staircase leading up near the safe room.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ugh, he doesn’t even know what Undertale is, he just watched a video of Papyrus on YouTube and liked his music.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Following the stairs puts us back near the start. It seems pointless, but it serves the purpose of letting us return to the start without leaving the dungeon proper, because riding the elevator and dropping down from the rafters was a one-way trip.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-004.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.gif"/> According to the map, we should be able to head down from here.<br/>
<br/>
what on earth<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-AnnRotate.gif"/> But nothing beyond this floor is on our map, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.gif"/> Yeah. We’ll need to find another one soon...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-MakotoRotate.gif"/> Why don’t we focus on finding a way downstairs? Hopefully we find the other map along the way...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Now, the path down is blocked by numerous cameras, so we’re forced to find a spot where we can jump down instead.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
If I just ignore it, he doesn’t win.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-MakotoRotate.gif"/> According to the map, there’s a great deal more beyond here...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-YusukeRotation.gif"/> Then this is not a vault, but a partition of sorts. The terminals there must be how you open it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-AnnRotate.gif"/> B-But both of them have keyholes.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-MakotoRotate.gif"/> I suppose that means we’ll need two keys to pass through here…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-RyujiRotate.gif"/> For real…? Ugh, it’s a pain in the ass how secure this place is.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-AnnRotate.gif"/> That must be where the Treasure is!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.gif"/> Yeah, you’re probably right… Let’s look for those keys!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Further ahead we come a room with a few interesting features. The first is the treasure chest.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The Black Kotagana is notably worse than our current weapon, oddly. However, it “possesses the power to transmute,” which we’ll come back to.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The other thing about this room is that it contains the power boxes for all the cameras in the neighboring hall.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We’re now free to explore the area.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shadow_4.jpg"/> What’s wrong? Are you nervous? Don’t be. We have the keys they need, so things should be OK as long as we protect them.<br/>
<br/>
I’m being terrorized by a 10-year-old.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-YusukeRotation.gif"/> It’s highly likely those are the way by which the partition opens.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-RyujiRotate.gif"/> What’re we gonna do then? Beat ‘em up and take the keys?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.gif"/> Didn’t you see those two? They’re obviously not ordinary Shadows. Anyone who’s been entrusted with a key that important would have to be extremely strong.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-AnnRotate.gif"/> And there’s two of them; it would be tough dealing with both. Plus they could sound the alarm...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.gif"/> Hm… That’s a good question.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-MakotoRotate.gif"/> Then… why don’t we split them up and beat them individually?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-YusukeRotation.gif"/> And how can we do that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-MakotoRotate.gif"/> Do you remember that monitoring room upstairs? The room we acquired our map from. There was some communication equipment there as well. We can use that to lure one away.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-AnnRotate.gif"/> I agree. It sounds safer than fighting them at the same time!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.gif"/> OK, let’s leave this part to our intellectual!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-MakotoRotate.gif"/> Thank you! First up, we need to head to the monitoring room!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-RyujiRotate.gif"/> Hey, you think we should just head straight over, Joker?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This choice is just asking you if you want to be teleported directly to the monitoring room from before.<br/>

Oh, this one’s a little sad. Ari really wanted to be Spider-Man for Halloween last year but our stepdad Louis thinks superheroes and Halloween are too pagan. I don’t really get it either, but Ari was pretty broken up about it. I bet he’s really jealous of that random child.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-RyujiRotate.gif"/> Guess that went pretty well, huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-MakotoRotate.gif"/> That means there should only be one Shadow in the security room! Let’s snatch the other key from it while we can!<br/>

This guy is a joke. We’ve already fought one of them, so we know its weakness is Nuclear, and it’s alone this time. We take it down easily. Banana, motherfucker.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.gif"/> Well, the most suspicious area would be the deepest part…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-YusukeRotation.gif"/> This map seems to indicate that the area beyond the partition is rather large as well...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.gif"/> I’m sure security will keep getting more intense from here onward too. We need to be careful.<br/>
<br/>
Let’s head back to the partition, then.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-AnnRotate.gif"/> On three! One, two…!<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, he… really likes Spider-Man. I actually had to sneak him out of the house to go see the new one because Louis wouldn’t let him. We don’t really talk much, but I thought it would be nice. I probably wouldn’t have done it if I knew he’d go this nuts though.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-MakotoRotate.gif"/> Yes, I agree. The cooperation of our whole team is what helped us through this particular ordeal.<br/>
<br/>
Except Yusuke and Morgana, who didn’t do shit.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.gif"/> So he took all of this from the weak...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-MakotoRotate.gif"/> ...He’s going to pay for this.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-047.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.gif"/> No… These ones seem different from what we’ve seen before… They turn on and off.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-MakotoRotate.gif"/> It might be a surveillance system that switches between multiple cameras for efficient coverage...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-RyujiRotate.gif"/> That just means we gotta pass by when it’s not recordin’, yeah?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.gif"/> That should work… but there are guards to watch out for too. We should proceed with caution!<br/>
<br/>
The gimmick here is that the cameras switch on and off frequently. The timing to pass through them can be pretty annoying to nail, especially when you take the guards into account. You can’t ambush through the path of a camera that’s on even if the enemy is within range, either.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yaksini is weak to Nuclear like half the other Shadows in here, and likes to enrage party members, both with dedicated skills and Physical strikes.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
To proceed, we have to walk out onto a nearby ledge and jump down to the lower floor.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
From here, we can head down using the nearby elevator or explore the area a bit further. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Leanan Sidhe is the first source of Psy damage we’ve yet encountered (bad news for Makoto), and is weak to Fire.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ann learns Agilao, the Medium Fire skill, at level 22. Astoundingly, she’s still nowhere close to gaining her next healing skill, meaning she’s still stuck with Dia. Ann is not a very effective healer.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The only thing of note on this floor is this hallway, containing a staircase leading to a door we can unlock that takes us back up, and this treasure chest behind a bunch of cameras. All that’s in it is an Ignis Ring, which we can slap on Yusuke to reduce the amount of Fire damage he takes. It’s really nothing special.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Heading back to the elevator, we take it down.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Okay, jeez, we get it. This LP isn’t your fucking trapper keeper.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-057.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-YusukeRotation.gif"/> It is difficult to hear what he’s saying from where we are now...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
On our way down, Makoto gains Freila, a single-target Medium Nuclear attack.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-060.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We also open a chest with one of our Lockpicks and get a new melee weapon for Makoto, who seems to just be on fire tonight.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-062.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-063.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-KaneshiroShadow2.jpg"/> Y-You bastards… How did you get this far!? What about my security!?<br/>
<br/>
how does he even know about the grimace<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-RyujiRotate.gif"/> Sorry, that shit was a piece of cake for us!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-YusukeRotation.gif"/> ...Well, I wouldn’t say it was that simple...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-KaneshiroShadow2.jpg"/> H-Hey, finish off these vermin here! Keep them away from the elevator at all costs!<br/>

<br/>
Here, we’re up against a new guy, plus the old guards. The Tornado Devil and Floodbringer Demon are both still weak against Electricity and Nuclear, respectively, so they shouldn’t give us too much trouble. However, the Demonic Warlord’s weakness happens to be Psy. Now, it’s unlikely that one will have a Persona with Psy unless they grabbed one of the Leanan Sidhes from earlier, but thankfully, Ari’s fusion of Matador gave him one such Persona.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
From that fight Yusuke learns Rising Slash, a Heavy Physical attack that gets an extra boost from Baton Passes. Here we finally see Yusuke’s main gimmick, his Baton Pass moves. They do great damage against most enemies, yes, but they’re absolutely worthless in boss fights, where you can’t exploit weaknesses. The main drawback of the Baton Pass/One More system in general is ultimately Yusuke’s undoing, which is a shame. For now, though, Rising Slash is still going to deal more damage than pretty much anything else we have, with or without the boost.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-MakotoRotate.gif"/> The pages afterward have been torn out as well. Could it be a code of some sort?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-RyujiRotate.gif"/> If we’re not gonna figure this shit out now, we should just keep goin’ forward, yeah?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Morgana.gif"/> Considering Kaneshiro’s reaction, this elevator should lead us to the innermost part of the bank. If so, it’ll be the most secure area as well. Let’s make sure we’re ready for whatever awaits!<br/>

<br/>
On the other side of the hall, we find a safe room. It would have been nice to have it <i>before</i> the last fight, but oh well. Keep it in mind anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Now, we just head down using the elevator.<br/>
