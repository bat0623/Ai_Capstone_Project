<br/>
You guys weren’t satisfied with being the nastiest group of crime-doers, no. You had to kill opera and late capitalism while you were at it! And then, noticing you had a space left, you added the hashtag for #brand #synergy. #Millennials truly are the sworn enemy of everything good and decent.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-AnnJacket.png"/> Huh, that’s not bad at all.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> A good name, for a rookie.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-RyujiCasual.png"/> #Millennials. We goin’ with that?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-003.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-RyujiCasual.png"/> There are tons of rotten adults and all… ...Why not just stick to targeting big names?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Let’s murder every rich person we see.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-RyujiCasual.png"/> Yeah, something along those lines. If we go after some bigwig, it’s gotta get on the news, right? Don’t you think more people would believe in us if we did that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> That’s not a bad idea… for you, Ryuji.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-AnnJacket.png"/> True. If we become better known… we might be able to give courage to a lot more people. I don’t really like the idea of just picking someone out of the blue though.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-RyujiCasual.png"/> Let’s narrow it down to someone we can all agree on then.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> Hm, so we need a bigwig we decide on unanimously.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-AnnJacket.png"/> I like that unanimous decision part! It’s like we’re making some kind of pact!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Sae.png"/> And on top of that, a talking cat told you all this?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Sae.png"/> Honestly speaking, that all sounds absurd. It’s hard to believe that this is even worth listening to. Still, it can’t be considered nonsense when parts of it align with Kamoshida’s confession. The same goes for the testimonies of the officers who arrested you. ...But so be it. At any rate, you mentioned something more important. These two other accomplices, besides this talking cat thing that appeared in your story… From what you’ve been telling me, they’re students at the same school, aren’t they?<br/>
<br/>
Accomplices? Maaku, you gotta stop confessing shit in between flashforwards, I can’t help you there!<br/>
<br/>
*Ahem* My client would like to retract the statement about accomplices, and add: “Fuck off, pig.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Sae.png"/> Very well. I’ll leave it at that. Let’s continue on. There are many more events that I must inquire on. Lies and false accounts are eventually exposed.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Sae.png"/> A master of Japanese arts. Ichiryusai Madarame. It’s even more incomprehensible than Kamoshida as to why this man was targeted. Where did you come to know him? And how did you learn of his crimes when you weren’t a victim of them? Start by telling me what you all schemed...<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> We officially established the Phantom Thieves, so it was totally worth it.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-AnnChat.png"/> I hope we can really help people. I’m curious about that Phantom Aficionado Website too. I wonder who made it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-RyujiChat.png"/> No clue. More importantly, you see the survey on there?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-AnnChat.png"/> I guess it’s not so bad if you put it that way...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-RyujiChat.png"/> But don’t you just wanna get it higher than that? I bet it’ll go up tons if we keep taking down big targets. It’s pretty damn exciting if you try and think about it like that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-AnnChat.png"/> You know, you’re actually right. Well then, let’s keep working hard from this point on!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
“Charismatic” is certainly an interesting adjective to pick there.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-TV.jpg"/> A former Olympian in volleyball, he confessed to assaulting and sexually harassing his students. Police will be investigating his high school tomorrow to substantiate the claims.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> It seems like the police will be coming to your school. Just act like you don’t know anything.<br/>
<br/>
You mean… lie? To the police? Aw geez, I don’t know about this, guys.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> Shouldn’t you give it some plant nutrients by now?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> These are some reasonably priced nutrients. This ought to bring a bit of life back to this plant!<br/>
<br/>
Maaku gets <b>Kindness +2</b>.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> That should do it for a while!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> That might not be a bad name!<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Justine.png"/> To think our master would give words of praise…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Caroline.png"/> You better treasure this moment, Inmate!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Igor.png"/> You have encountered allies who share your aesthetics, and you have found your place in reality. The time has come… Your rehabilitation will soon begin.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Igor.png"/> I shall explain it to you now… You have a special potential. However, that must be refined into a useful power. It is weak now, but refining it shall grant you the strength to stand against the coming ruin. ...That is the rehabilitation cast upon you.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Igor.png"/> There are various means by which you may gain the power to resist the ruin. Fighting Shadows and gaining experience is one way. The fusion process I taught you prior is another.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Caroline.png"/> This is all possible because of our master’s guidance, Inmate!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Justine.png"/> Though it may be presumptuous of us, we have words of wisdom as well.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Caroline.png"/> When you’re out in reality, you better hone your relationships with those you have contracts with! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Justine.png"/>Spending time with those people… will lead to the cultivation of your relationships with them.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Caroline.png"/> If you’ve got time to waste, you’d better visit your contractors, Inmate!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Justine.png"/> That is another source of power to evade the ruin that our master has mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
Please stop alternating sentences, you’re making me dizzy.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Igor.png"/> It seems the rehabilitation is going well. This is a truly joyous occasion… I shall grant you an ability befitting of your newfound growth. Consider it a gift. May the devotion to your rehabilitation grow even deeper. ...I have high hopes of you.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah sure, dude, whatever you say.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Sweet, we can now carry eight Personas instead of just six.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Justine.png"/> ...The time has come. Return to your brief moments of rest.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Caroline.png"/> And don’t forget to go talk to your contractors, Inmate!<br/>

This is just reiterating what Confidants give you, but also in case you didn’t take the hint with Takemi, not all Confidants start with the story. In fact, we’re going to get a lot more opportunities to form Confidants very soon.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Kawakami.png"/> The gist is, don’t go around talking about the incident. That’s all. The police are still investigating Mr. Kamoshida, so I can’t say anything myself. As a teacher though, I’m ashamed for not having noticed that a student was suffering like that… I’m not defending him, but as a colleague, he just seemed like… well, a normal person. Honestly, it still doesn’t feel real. I guess people can have multiple sides to them...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> The teachers have it rough, huh…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Kawakami.png"/> Oh yeah, I just remembered something I learned about psychology. They say that humans have several different personalities hidden in their subconscious.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> Different personalities…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Kawakami.png"/> Oh, to be clear, I’m not talking about multiple personality disorder. These different personalities can be a different gender or a different age from you. I mean, if you think about how gods and monsters in myths were first based on the human image… If you actually saw one of those personalities with your own eyes, it might look like a monster.<br/>
<br/>
This sounds like some pseudoscience. Are you sure you should be teaching us this?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> Oho...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Kawakami.png"/> Hm? You all seem more alert than usual. Did I say something wrong? Well, I’m just saying what I’ve heard. It feels like I just now understood what I learned long ago.<br/>
<br/>
“Just saying what I’ve heard” is a really great thing to say as a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> Subconscious personalities… It’s a fascinating topic, and it has a lot to do with us. That teacher’s surprisingly smart, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Were we listening to the same thing? Am I crazy or is everything she just said batshit? I feel like she’s about to divine my aetheric resonance or some shit.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Protag.png"/> <i>It feels like gaining that <b>Knowledge</b> made me a bit smarter...</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Girl_5.jpg"/> But look at what happened to Kamoshida.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Girl_6.jpg"/> He probably just couldn’t keep hiding it after that girl tried to kill herself.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Girl_5.jpg"/> Yeah, you might be right. I guess there’s no way they really exist.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Girl_6.jpg"/> Most importantly, it seriously sucks that our school is gonna be known for stuff like this!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Girl_5.jpg"/> I wonder if it’ll affect our college entrance...<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Ryuji.png"/> If we can take care of two or three famous guys, people’ll have to believe we exist.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Ann.png"/> So about those big shots… We don’t have any leads yet, right? Plus there’s that rumor about you two threatening Kamoshida too…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> Looks like you’ll just have to live a normal, honest school life for the time being. Still, make sure you stay prepared just in case anything comes up, all right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Ryuji.png"/> I’ll keep an eye out for info on any big shots that might be comin’ around.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Ann.png"/> And I’ll try to dig up some dirt online.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Ryuji.png"/> We went and formed the Phantom Thieves group, but we can’t even find a target…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Ann.png"/> There, there...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Ryuji.png"/> I guess sometimes things just don’t go the way we want ‘em to…<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Principal.png"/> That is what I wish to know… Even if it takes some probing into student matters… I would like you to look into this for me. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Makoto.png"/> It is true that there are many rumors regarding Mr. Kamoshida, but… Do you mean all of this talk about those Phantom Thieves?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Principal.png"/> It is undeniable that Mr. Kamoshida has “changed” in some way. I’d like to have a grasp of the cause. This shall also ensure that I handle the mass media and police in the correct fashion.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Mishima.png"/> Have you seen that Phantom Aficionado Website?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Mishima.png"/> I’m the one who started it.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Mishima.png"/> ...You guys are the Phantom Thieves, aren’t you?<br/>
<br/>
Fuck. Well, it was nice for the one day we managed to keep that secret. Wait, maybe we can salvage this. Think Morgana knows anything about getting rid of a body?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Mishima.png"/> ...Sorry. Although… if things really are as I think, I should keep it a secret. Kamoshida used me, and I did some horrible things to you guys. This isn’t much of a way for me to apologize for it...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-056.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This guy really needs to take a hint.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Mishima.png"/> That’s… all I needed to say. There are many more evil adults outside of Kamoshida. But I’m sure the Phantom Thieves will do something… They can’t let this end after just one target. That’s why I wanted to make a forum where people could post their problems. There are probably a lot of people who have high hopes for the Phantom Thieves’ next move. So I’ve also implemented an anonymous poll on the site.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Mishima.png"/> I… hope someday my forum is filled with supportful posts. I’d really like to help out in the Phantom Thieves’ acts of justice! ...Can I, please?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
If it’ll shut you up about it, sure.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Mishima.png"/> Yeah, I will.<br/>

<br/>
Okay, for one, you’re asking me if I know the person running my fansite. It just so happens that I do, but that’s irrelevant. It’s an absurd question. Also, how do you not know who Mishima is? If we’ve gained any sort of notoriety, and judging from this framing device we have, surely you’ve already looked into the Phan-site? You know that you can just run a fucking whois on that, right? Unless Mishima’s hiding behind eight proxies, scrub.<br/>

Oh shit, it’s what P3 and P4 were sorely missing, the ability to have backup party members gain experience! Spoiler, I guess: we gain more party members. It’s not 1:1, but it’s still great.<br/>
<br/>
The Moon Arcana represents illusion, fear, and insecurity, as well as confusion and unhappiness. It’s a card of mystery and the subconscious.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Ryuji.png"/> Geez… It was a little awkward tryin’ to figure out when to walk over here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Ann.png"/> So that forum is Mishima-kun’s…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> Has he figured out our identities?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Ann.png"/> Even so, I think it’ll be fine. He seemed to be playing it cool.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Ryuji.png"/> I guess we should have a little chat about this later.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> I will say though… a forum where people can post problems may prove unexpectedly useful.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Ryuji.png"/> Anyways, we gotta get lookin’ for a new target.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Ann.png"/> And we need to stay sharp until we manage to find one. Once we do, we’ll have to head into another Palace, so we should prep our equipment and--<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Ryuji.png"/> D-D-Don’t we have an exam comin’ up!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Ann.png"/> ...Judging by that reaction, I’d assume you’re going to struggle this time too?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Ryuji.png"/> It’s not like you’re any better! All you’re good at is English!<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> Even your Japanese is questionable at best, Ryuji.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Ryuji.png"/> What’s questionable is whether you’re really even a human.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
A+, Ryuji.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> ...Let’s discuss this with our fists!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Ann.png"/> Will you two stop it!?<br/>
<br/>
We still don’t have a target, and now exams are coming up! Seems like we have a lot on our plate right now. And here I was thinking the buffet was last update, hyuk hyuk!
