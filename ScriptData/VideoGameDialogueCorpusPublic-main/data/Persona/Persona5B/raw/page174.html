<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-FutabaOracle.png"/> We’re leaving the cleaner for last, so we just got that IT president guy left. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoQueen.png"/> We don’t have any clues about him yet though… Either way, let’s proceed onward. We still haven’t gotten a full grasp of this ship’s layout. <br/>
<br/>
The Phantom Thieves have taken down a new target, so it’s time for them to move on! And you know what that means...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-capture_001_09112018_121937.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
MORE!!! FUCKING!!!!! HALLWAYS!!!!!!! <br/>
<br/>
At least in this map we can actually see where the mouse statue areas are in grey. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
These are Hanuman(s). They’re weak to Ice (but also have an Evade Ice skill), and can use Physical and crit boosting skills.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
In the main hall, we find the interesting gimmick of this hall. See, the statues are actually off by default here, and the only way to the exit is past a lock door. The only way to subvert that door is through a mouse-sized vent right next to it. You see where this is going, and you’ll probably be able to guess where the switch the thieves need to activate to progress is. Yep! It’s all the way north, which they can only get to from the west, which means they have to work their way all the way around this area! And once they do that, the enemies will have respawned, so they’ll be forced to do another round of evasion to get to the vent! <br/>
<br/>
If my mind was structured like this, I’d probably murder someone too. Just sayin’.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-008.jpg"/><br/>

Queen learns Mafreidyne to replace Mafreila somewhere in the maze of <i>hell</i>ways (heh, you get it?)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And eventually, the thieves make it through to the Side Deck, which contains another safe room to checkpoint them.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-010.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-012.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Cleaner.jpg"/> Nope. But… You beat the crap outta my men, and I can’t exactly let that pass. I’m gonna have to avenge them. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-RyujiSkull.png"/> Wait, you’re the one who attacked us, remember!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Cleaner.jpg"/> Hmph, you sure do an awful lot of barkin’. Well, I guess I could let you off the hook… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-MorganaAngry.png"/> Get ready. Here they come…! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Some more of these guys, who are still weak to Bless. Not much for the thieves to worry about. This cleaner dude needs to do better, Lord Shido deserves it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-YusukeFox.png"/> We caused no trouble whatsoever, yet were met with the same end result…<br/>
<br/>
Fox, you pesky thieves have been causing nothing but trouble all day.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-RyujiSkull.png"/> And on top of all that, he up and disappeared again! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoQueen.png"/> We should ignore him if our actions have no actual impact on the results. For now, let’s focus on searching for the IT company president. I hope there are clues somewhere… <br/>
<br/>
The P-Thieves are left with no choice but to proceed through a door at the end of the hall. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Which, naturally, leads to… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-capture_002_09112018_121952.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
MORE OF THIS BULLSHIT<br/>
<br/>
At least it’s short, this time. The thieves simply need to get through a simple series of rooms. Some of the rooms have statues, but others do not. I’m not even sure why there’s a switch to turn the statues off in this one, the thieves don’t actually need to press it for any reason. It’s not vital to their egress or even used to conceal a treasure chest, it’s just there if they want to clean up the theft spots I guess.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
These Baphomets are weak to Bless, block Curse, and use Fire, Ice, and Electricity. They also have skills to increase their Burn, Freeze, and Shock rate with those skills. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This is Oberon, it is weak to Nuke, blocks Psy, and uses Wind and Physical. It also has Evade Nuke.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Once the Thieves make it out, they find themselves somewhere that feels a bit familiar… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Why, it was the locked door from the main hall!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoQueen.png"/> And without any particularly useful information about the IT company president… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-FutabaOracle.png"/> He almost never leaves his room! Nobody’s even seen him around! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-YusukeFox.png"/> Hm. If he “almost never” leaves, does that mean there are times that he does in fact leave?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-FutabaOracle.png"/> Wouldn’t he have to head out to go to the bathroom? That’s how it was for me in my room! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-HaruNoir.png"/> But there are restrooms in the rooms here… What about meals? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-FutabaOracle.png"/> Just one call and your food gets delivered to your room. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoQueen.png"/> I think you’re right. Though this place is just a cognition, it has restaurants and bars as well. If the IT company president never leaves his room, somebody must be delivering the food to him. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-AnnPanther.png"/> Ohhh, so you think we should get info at the restaurants too! Nice idea, Joker! Oh, and Queen! <br/>
<br/>
So, the thieves are heading back to the restaurant.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-HaruNoir.png"/> Um, is it possible to have meals delivered to my room? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-ShidoWaiter.jpg"/> You mean room service. Yes, that is available only at this restaurant. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-AnnPanther.png"/> Aha! So, is there one room in particular that always orders food delivery?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-ShidoWaiter.jpg"/> Pardon me, but why are you asking me this? I would like to see your boarding passes if you don’t mind.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoQueen.png"/> O-Oh um, we’ve been asked to make a delivery. It’s to the president of an IT company, I believe. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-ShidoWaiter.jpg"/> …… Hm… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoQueen.png"/> He apparently never leaves his room, but Mr. Shido has given us direct orders about this… Now then, this is a highly confidential matter, so we must take it to him ourselves. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-ShidoWaiter.jpg"/> Ah, is that so? In that case, let me tell you the way to his room.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-HaruNoir.png"/> Isn’t this pretty close? I suppose it’s just upstairs. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-YusukeFox.png"/> It seems to be above the side deck we passed through earlier. Is there a way up somewhere? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-FutabaOracle.png"/> Honestly guys, I doubt this is gonna be any use. If it were me, I’d never open that door. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-AnnPanther.png"/> Well that’s no good! What are we gonna do!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-MorganaSquint.png"/> If only there was a way in besides through the door… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-AnnPanther.png"/> In any case, should we head back to the side deck? No that we’ll be able to get in from there… <br/>
<br/>
The Phantom Thieves backtrack to a safe room, then warp back to the Side Deck.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-MorganaAngry.png"/> If getting this door open is impossible, we’ll just have to find another route inside. It’s the room directly above here, right? Hmm… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Heading over to the east, the thieves find their path obstructed.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
But what’s this?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-030.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-FutabaOracle.png"/> I mean, we ARE phantom thieves. We can use places that normal guests don’t have access to. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoQueen.png"/> A ship needs a source of power to sail. There must be an engine room nearby. <br/>
<br/>
So, the thieves’ current task is to climb up and up.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-033.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-AnnPanther.png"/> The view is terrible though. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-036.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And the thieves have made it to the room.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-FutabaOracle.png"/> The cabin the target’s in is right there!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-YusukeFox.png"/> Indeed, I can sense someone within its walls. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Morgana.png"/> What should we do, Joker? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-ProtagJoker.png"/> &gt;Check inside.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Morgana.png"/> All right, here goes. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Oh, this seems like a <i>great</i> idea.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-HaruNoir.png"/> By yourself? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-FutabaOracle.png"/> He’ll be on guard if we all go together… Plus, it’s IT stuff! This is my time to shine! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-MakotoQueen.png"/> Should we leave it to her? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-FutabaOracle.png"/> I can do it! It’s like that show where the kid goes shopping alone for the first time. Hehe, this is gonna be tough. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-RyujiSkull.png"/> She’s feelin’ good enough to joke around, so maybe this’ll be fine after all…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-AnnPanther.png"/> Just yell if things get dangerous, OK? <br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-IT_President.jpg"/> That’s right. Why did you have to go and destroy our work? <br/>

<br/>
Futaba sweats.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-FutabaOracle.png"/> I-It was just because I couldn’t forgive someone using the Medjed name without my permission. So, why’d you send Medjed after the Phantom Thieves? <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-IT_President.jpg"/> There was no reason to choose Medjed per se. Their popularity was convenient for us though. We knew the Phantom Thieves couldn’t target an anonymous group, after all. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-FutabaOracle.png"/> That’s why…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-IT_President.jpg"/> Medjed’s defeat was supposed to be an act, so their actual fall was quite a shock to me and Akechi-kun. We were planning on shutting it down anyway though, so it really didn’t conflict with our plans. The Phantom Thieves must’ve enjoyed their moment in the spotlight, not knowing it would be so short-lived. You see, you gotta abuse a tool like the internet. Well, the word abuse doesn’t really describe it. The real charm comes in making use of the internet in innovative ways that circumvent legal restrictions. <br/>
<br/>
Oh my god shut uuuuuuup<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-FutabaOracle.png"/> You little… <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-IT_President.jpg"/> ...What a stupid idea. Don’t tell me you destroyed my website for this so-called “societal reform”?<br/>

These guys don’t present much of a threat to the Phantom Thieves, unfortunately for us. The Titanias are still weak to Psy and the Oberon is still weak to Nuke, so they’ll spend most of the fight hitting those weaknesses in order to get All-out Attacks. The Oberon can summon more Titanias once they die, but it’s still not much.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-Shido.png"/> Nothing in particular. But if something were to happen, it would already be too late. <br/>
