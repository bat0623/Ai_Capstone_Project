<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Murmur.jpg"/> Just hurry up and arrest the Phantom Thieves already… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Murmur.jpg"/> I’m curious… It seems like he knows something. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Whisper.jpg"/> I bet he found out some really juicy secret!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-MakotoCasual.png"/> Well… Sis actually stopped mentioning anything about work in front of me… It’s possible I made some sort of mistake…<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you sure fucked up that data transfer.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-MakotoCasual.png"/> Regardless, I thought over the matter of who we’re going to invite for our school festival… I’m considering asking Akechi-kun. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiCasual.png"/> For real!? Weren’t you talkin’ about how you didn’t wanna draw danger to us or whatever? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-MakotoCasual.png"/> I understand this is dangerous. But without a powerful source of intel, we won’t be able to win against the police network. And I can no longer rely on my sister for information… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-HaruCasual.png"/> Wait, is this because of Akechi-kun’s police connections? You’re going to use him as your “powerful source of intel”…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> Bold move. I’m surprised to hear that suggestion coming from you, Makoto. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-MakotoCasual.png"/> Did you see his press conference yesterday? One of his comments defending the Phantom Thieves stood out to me. “There is more to this.” I think he said that knowing for certain that the Phantom Thieves would be watching. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-YusukeJacket.png"/> Still, there will be so many other students at the school festival… What are the odds of success? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-MakotoCasual.png"/> It’s a gamble. And the odds are less than favorable… But we can no longer afford to hesitate. <i>(to Maaku)</i> What are your thoughts? Should we invite Akechi-kun? <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-MakotoCasual.png"/> In that case… I’ll do it. Is everyone else OK with that? <br/>
<br/>
The group nods.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-AnnJacket.png"/> I’m good… Whatever he says has gotta be more reliable than what I’ve been able to come up with. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-YusukeJacket.png"/> It would be reassuring to gain him as an ally, rather than simply a source of information. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiCasual.png"/> Hold on, how’re we even gonna get in touch with him? It’s not like we got his contact info… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-FutabaJacket.png"/> We have all the data from the PC of a public prosecutor! Finding his phone number was a no brainer! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiCasual.png"/> Damn, you’re real impressive… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-HaruCasual.png"/> But then, wouldn’t he wonder how we acquired his number? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-MakotoCasual.png"/> I’ll just say my sister had it. That isn’t even technically a lie.<br/>
<br/>
Ha, devious. Though if he ends up asking Sae about it we’re totally boned. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-MakotoCasual.png"/> Can you send me the number, Futaba? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-006.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
You already agreed, Ryuji. Shut up.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-AnnJacket.png"/> Now’s no time to be petty. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> Just think of him as a source of intel, nothing more. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-008.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-MakotoCasual.png"/> He says, “Let me think about it.”<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-RyujiCasual.png"/> Wait a sec. Didn’t he say he wasn’t gonna do any more stuff for the media? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-YusukeJacket.png"/> That’s likely why he’s so hesitant. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-AnnJacket.png"/> What’re we gonna do if he turns us down? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-MakotoCasual.png"/> I’ll keep trying. It may be frustrating, but he’s all we have at the moment. We need him to do it, no matter what. <br/>
<br/>
What if he refuses? Are you just gonna wear him down with “pleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleasepleaseplease”?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> We’re counting on you, Makoto… <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-TV.jpg"/> Stock prices of security companies are on the rise due to growing concerns about public safety. Overall stock market performance, though, is down, and phantom thief goods companies are suffering… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-MorganaAngry.png"/> I never expected that even the economy would get worse… This isn’t our fault! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Sojiro.png"/> You’re not at fault. Still, he might try to harass you… <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Cop.jpg"/> All right, Akechi-kun, let’s get you home. Your family is probably worried about you. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Souse.jpg"/> Hmm, there’sh an inshident, offisher! Which way’s yer car? Heeey, taxi! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Cop.jpg"/> Geez, my patrol car isn’t a taxi. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Fishy_Hawker.jpg"/> They only target high-profile people like artists and CEOs. And who could believe they’d have a change of heart, anyway? I’m sure it’s all staged! Scumbags deserve to be destroyed, not have a change of heart. The world’d be better off that way. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Beefy_Trendsetter.jpg"/> What? Are you going against the grain just to be cool? You don’t have to push it. Just be yourself. Isn’t that what you promised when you changed your image and moved out here? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Scruffy_Romantic.jpg"/> I haven’t changed anything! But perhaps I have forgotten who I am, deep down inside… <br/>

And this, children, is an example of how an errant comma can completely change the meaning of a sentence. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-College_Student_2.jpg"/> Murder’s a step too far. My friends in class were shocked. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-College_Student_1.jpg"/> OK, OK, enough worrying! We got more important concerns, like when our next party’ll be!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Shop_Manager.jpg"/> I see you’ve been practicing. Your Japanese is much better. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Foreign_Barker.jpg"/> I no longer fear prejudice, now that I’ve learned to be sincere and hospitable! I wonder if the Phantom Thieves are struggling with he same thing. I don’t think they murdered anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Aww, Foreign Barker! You do believe in us! <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-unsmith.gif" title=":unsmith:"/><br/>

So, we need Guts to advance Iwai, and pretty much all of our night Confidants are gated by Mementos. This means that we’re going to be consuming a lot of burgers to increase our Guts instead of advancing Confidants.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Also, how the hell did that leak? I doubt Makoto was going around telling people, unless the faculty jumped the gun. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Boy_5.jpg"/> I kinda saw that coming. Everyone I know voted for him. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Boy_6.jpg"/> Didn’t he say he wasn’t gonna make any more appearances though? Why’d he agree to come here? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Boy_5.jpg"/> It probably has to do with the Phantom Thieves. Wasn’t Akechi going around saying how evil they were before?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Boy_6.jpg"/> Oh yeah! That proves they’re connected to our school somehow then! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Boy_5.jpg"/> Hey, you’re right! Maybe he’ll tell us some stuff about the case! No way am I gonna miss the panel this year! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-MorganaAngry.png"/> Hmph… They just say whatever they want with no thought… But for now we’ll just need to endure it. At least until we can get some more intel… <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Chouno.png"/> I’m the advisor for the ESS, so I’ll be busy helping them today. ESS stands for English Study Society, by the way. We need to advertise that Shujin’s a school that provides an education you can use anywhere in the world. Hey! Mr. Hamiru! There are tons of three-letter acronyms like ESS in the world. Can you tell me what the S in SOS means? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Chouno.png"/> Correct. SOS is often said to mean “save our ship.” “Save our souls” is another interpretation too… ...But in reality, it’s not an acronym of anything. It’s just the simplest thing you can send in Morse code in an emergency. If you haven’t finished preparing for the festival though, it’s too late to send an SOS now. <br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Knowledge +1</b>. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Chouno.png"/> The school festival isn’t just a time for you students to goof off. It’s an important event where we invite prospective students, PTA members, and the like to attend. This time, we have Akechi-san for a panel. There will be twice as many guests even though it’s a weekday. <br/>
<br/>
Did I miss something? Did he already agree?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Chouno.png"/> I’ll have to spend twice as much time on my makeup tomorrow too… Be on your best behavior! Got it? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Morgana.png"/> The school festival, huh… Is Akechi really going to be there… <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Girl_6.jpg"/> Hey, look at that! Look who got the top score! <br/>

Then why was everyone talking like it was a done deal!?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-HaruChat.jpg"/> But tomorrow is the start of the school festival. Will this be OK? If Akechi-kun declines our offer, we won’t have a guest… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-AnnChat.png"/> Huh? That’s what you’re worried about?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoChat.jpg"/> I appreciate the concern, but it will be fine. I just need to get Akechi-kun to agree to this somehow. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-FutabaChat.jpg"/> Yup. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-RyujiChat.png"/> What’s that bastard up to anyways? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-FutabaChat.jpg"/> He hasn’t done anything since he said he was gonna go into hiding. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MakotoChat.jpg"/> I’m not sure. I’ll try explaining the circumstances surrounding the school festival to him again. Hopefully he can give me a response by the end of the day. I’ll let you know if I make any progress on that front. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Haughty.png"/> That politician is honest and carries an overwhelming amount of charisma. It feels like a trustworthy leader for Japan has finally come forth. Don’t you think, Boss?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Sojiro.png"/> Sorry, wasn’t listening. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-054.jpg"/><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Goro.png"/> It may be somewhat of a stretch to say I’m “on their side.” Having said that, I won’t deny that I empathize with them on some level. If this Okumura incident was not the Phantom Thieves… If they only change the hearts of criminals… Then even though they can’t be considered “innocent”… Perhaps my goals are not so different from theirs. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Goro.png"/> Hahaha. I knew there was something special about you, ever since the first time we met. I feel as though I could tell you anything during our conversations. <br/>

Man, Akechi’s really into me. Shame we didn’t pick that route. And also that he’s a cop.<br/>
