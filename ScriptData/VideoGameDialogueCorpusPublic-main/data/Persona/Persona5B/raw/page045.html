<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Sojiro.png"/> I heard customers say it’s gotten pretty dangerous over there. Don’t let yourself be a target, got it?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-002.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-YusukeChat.jpg"/> I most certainly am not. I must express my gratitude earnestly.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-RyujiChat.png"/> You’re one of us now, man. We’ll be counting on you, mkay?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Of course.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-AnnChat.png"/> And if anything comes up, we won’t hesitate to lend a hand.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Thank you. Well then, see you.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> Well, there were a lot of ups and downs, but we still pulled off our first job! Yusuke joined the team too, so let’s continue reforming society like this!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-TV.jpg"/> He has admitted to selling copies of his famous painting “Sayuri” as the genuine article. Police intend to thoroughly investigate Mr. Madarame for fraud...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> Madarame is on TV! This is getting to be major news.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It’s Sunday, you know what that means! Maaku gains <b>Charm +1</b>.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-College_Student_1.jpg"/> I can’t take it anymore, man! Guess I gotta change the world myself, buuuddy!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-College_Student_1.jpg"/> ...Partying as hard as I can at the club, m’dude! Oh yeeeah!<br/>
<br/>
We all handle these trying times in different ways.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-capture_001_20082017_135935.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Homeless_Man_2.jpg"/> Someone finally exposed Madarame for stealing art. What will happen to the pieces themselves?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-capture_002_20082017_135942.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Homeless_Man_2.jpg"/> Do they even have any value? Sorry, just curious. I used to be really into art. Maybe now my art can live on unsullied… S’pose I owe the Phantom Thieves for this.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-MishimaGreen.png"/> Info has started pouring into the Phan-Site too. I’m gonna be a busy bee!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Office_Worker_2.jpg"/> Yeah, it was right at the end of the exhibit. It’s obvious that there’s some ulterior motive.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Office_Worker_3.jpg"/> They spent so much money on all those ads. The people backing Madarame must be panicking.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Office_Worker_2.jpg"/> It’s every man for himself in this world. It’s pretty rotten when I think about it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-010.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Rural_Young_Man.jpg"/> I even hear there’s a bunch a thieves on the loose! C’mon, lemme take ya home.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Adorable_Woman.jpg"/> You’re overreacting. Besides, the Phantom Thieves are on our side.<br/>
<br/>
We haven’t seen these two before because their conversations haven’t been terribly relevant or interesting, but they’re engaged in a game-long argument about him wanting her to return home to the countryside.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Tora.png"/> Please know that you can direct your criticism and outrage at me! I, Toranosuke Yoshida, will someday find a way to address your concerns in Nagata-cho… Oh, Hamiru-kun. How’s your schoolwork? By the way, what’s your opinion about our current government? I feel that they’re wrong, so I plan on addressing that during my speech. I’d like you to listen to it, so you can give me your honest opinion.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Protag.png"/> &gt;Help him out<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Tora.png"/> Really? That would be helpful. Well then, let’s get to it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Tora.png"/> However, the current administration refuses to discuss their plans for the future… Can we really accept such an utter lack of transparency!?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-014.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Woman_5.jpg"/> So he’s just echoing another politician’s criticism of the government?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Man_6.jpg"/> Apparently. Tch, whatever…<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Tora.png"/> Urgh, It seems I’ve drawn the ire of the audience once again. So he’s claiming those who have made mistakes in the past shouldn’t get a second chance? What can I say to that?<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Tora.png"/> The highlight, though, was your yelling.<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Tora.png"/> Conveying your thoughts with such conviction. I wish I had done that in the past… ...OK, that is all for today.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-027.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Flashy_Man.jpg"/> ...I’ve been wrong this whole time. Even though someone has failed in the past, it doesn’t mean that person can’t try again. Th-That’s all I wanted to say!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Tora.png"/> Please wait! Thank you! ...That is all I wanted to say. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Flashy_Man.jpg"/> You’re a strange one, just like that kid.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Tora.png"/> I have a bad habit of getting flustered whenever someone calls me No-Good Tora. But you see me as someone of value, so I refuse to cower to criticism in front of you. Today you taught me that I must have more confidence in my arguments.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Tora.png"/> My way of thinking changes when I’m with you. Perhaps it’s the influence of your youthful sprit. Ah, my apologies. It seems we’re out of time.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Protag.png"/> <i>I feel like helping with the speech has served to increase my <b>Charm</b>...</i><br/>

<br/>
This game’s got some good dated internet slang.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Chatter.jpg"/> That’s a calling card from the Phantom Thieves, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Murmur.jpg"/> The way it’s written seems pretty legit...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Murmur.jpg"/> Have they really stolen people’s hearts?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Whisper.jpg"/> I can’t believe the Phantom Thieves actually exist...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Ryuji.png"/> The response to Madarame’s press conference was huge! Everyone’s talkin’ about the calling card. Girls are checkin’ me out today… Maybe they can’t help but sense my overflowin’ phantom thief charisma? Oh shit, am I finally startin’ to be popular with all the fly hon-- ...Oh no!<br/>
<br/>
Maaku takes a moment to thank the universe for preventing Ryuji from speaking the phrase “fly honeys” in Motherfucking TYOOL (Whatever Year This Is).<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Ryuji.png"/> Of course there is! My uniform, man! My uniform! We’re s’posed to switch to summer uniforms today! I knew people were lookin’ at me… Oh, goddammit! I gotta go home and change, so you go on ahead!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ha, “Pallid Fella.” This game likes to get cute with the random NPC titles sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Boy_10.jpg"/> Watching that famous artist cry his eyes out over all the artwork he’s stolen… The same thing happened to Kamoshida, right? Both got weird calling cards, too… If you ask me, the same person is behind all this.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Boy_5.jpg"/> The news this morning said a group called #Millennials are the ones behind the cards. I wonder how they get people to confess. I mean, they can’t literally be “stealing hearts.” ...Blackmail, maybe?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-MakotoSummer.png"/> I have nothing to report yet...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Principal.png"/> Nothing at all? How many students are there who could provoke a teacher?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-MakotoSummer.png"/> I’ve already narrowed it down. I just… can’t get any solid evidence.<br/>
<br/>
That’s pretty sad, considering how bad we are at hiding it. Our hideout is in a public, heavily trafficked location, for crying out loud.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Principal.png"/> *sigh*<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-MakotoSummer.png"/> You knew, didn’t you…? About Mr. Kamoshida sexually harassing students.<br/>
<br/>
The principal looks away.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Principal.png"/> What will come of you asking that?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-MakotoSummer.png"/> This investigation is for a just cause, correct?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Principal.png"/> I believe I understand how flustered this must be making you. I’m sure it was truly shocking for you as student council president to see a peer attempt suicide...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-MakotoSummer.png"/> Yes...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Principal.png"/> We must provide a school environment where all students can feel at ease. That is the most pressing issue we have to tackle at the moment.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-MakotoSummer.png"/> So that’s your reason behind this investigation on the Phantom Thieves of Hearts? We don’t even know if they truly exist. Why are you--<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Principal.png"/> You heard about the incident with that Madarame fellow, I assume?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-MakotoSummer.png"/> ...They said there was a similar calling card to the one used in Mr. Kamoshida’s case.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Principal.png"/> I wish to believe that this is unrelated to our students.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-MakotoSummer.png"/> Yes...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Principal.png"/> That is where I stand. I suggest you devote your energy to the task at hand, not unnecessary questions.<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Boy_5.jpg"/> You mean that guy who was all like, “How could I possibly… apologize for what I’ve done… Aaaah...”?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Boy_2.jpg"/> Think it was really those phantom thieves? You know, the whole stealing your heart thing.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Boy_5.jpg"/> That… There’s no way. But then again… it seems too convenient for it all to just be coincidence.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-AnnSummer.png"/> Oh yeah. I guess that’s true. By the way, I decided on the TV station. What about you two?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-RyujiSummer.png"/> Huh…? Oh crap, the social studies trip! Ugh, I just wanna ditch it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> You’d better go to your school activities. Didn’t I tell you not to draw attention to yourselves?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-RyujiSummer.png"/> Wouldn’t me suddenly turnin’ into a good student stand out more?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> Quit bickering and go.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-AnnSummer.png"/> I heard we’re gonna get to watch them tape a show! Maybe there’ll be actresses there!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-RyujiSummer.png"/> Oh well. Not like I got anything better to do than waitin’ for info to come in online. Plus, Morgana’s right. Showin’ up’ll keep the teachers from gettin’ all suspicious of me. All right, I’m gonna head back. <i>(to self)</i> TV, huh… Maybe I should get a haircut...<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Madarame is the only topic of conversation at my school. And as I’m his pupil, most of my peers have chosen to ignore me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-RyujiChat.png"/> For real? That’s bullshit.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-AnnChat.png"/> Are you going to be OK?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-YusukeChat.jpg"/> There is no need to worry. They had already been treating me differently from others as it stood. This is nothing new to me.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-AnnChat.png"/> OK then...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-AnnChat.png"/> Great idea!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-MishimaChat.png"/> Anyway, here are the details. The girl acting like a queen is Hikari Shimizu. I wonder if it’s more likely that a girl will turn out like that if she has S as an initial… Well, I already posted the warning, so you should take it on when you have the time! Hopefully you don’t end up an M!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Morgana’s so pure and innocent.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> Anyway, it seems like she’s a worthy target. Let’s find time to consult the others at the hideout.<br/>
<br/>
We’re not actually going to head into Mementos today, because we need our night period.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-053.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Girl_1.jpg"/> You think maybe the Phantom Thieves go to our school? That’d be exciting, wouldn’t it?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Girl_2.jpg"/> That’s great and all, but I’m more excited by something else. Our field trip is coming up, and I want to go see the TV station!<br/>
<br/>
Nearly every single person in the game has had their dialogue update, so we’ll be doing a lot of checking on various people today. Now that #Millennials have made their debut, there’s a lot of buzz, especially around the school. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-055.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Chatter.jpg"/> I kinda thought they were fake, but maybe they do exist after all… Y’know, that logo’s actually pretty cool. Did he draw that? Is he a fan of theirs? I never would’ve expected it from a stern guy like him…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> Our name’s starting to get out there. I’m excited to see what happens next!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The other blackboard has updated once more.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-MakotoSummer.png"/> What have Sakamoto-kun and Takamaki-san been saying about that shocking Madarame case? O-Oh, um… never mind. I was simply curious. I-I should start heading home too. If you’ll excuse me...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-Newspaper.jpg"/> Let me get your opinion on this. What do you think is the Phantom Thieves’ objective?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-Newspaper.jpg"/> There’s a lot of bad guys in the world, so I’d like to support the Phantom Thieves too. For the newspaper club, I’ll continue to watch for what the Phantom Thieves will do next.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Next, we head over to the guy who’s being stalked.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-IkesugiFriend.jpg"/> Oh, yeah, when I looked up the Phantom Thieves online, I found this weird blog by a crazy person. Her blog’s called “Phantom Thieves want to Steal My Boyfriend.” She mentions “blood storms”… a lot.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-Ikesugi.jpg"/> Whoa. She really sounds deranged. I feel bad for her boyfriend, whoever he is.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Stalker.jpg"/> After that artist, though, those Phantom Thieves might come back to steal Ikesugi-kun’s heart! If they come, I’ll show them no mercy. I’ll make them bleed… It’ll be a blood storm! *giggle*<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-Girl_5.jpg"/> Wow! Maybe we know them!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Girl_2.jpg"/> I dunno. Everyone here is so… ordinary.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-Girl_5.jpg"/> Maybe, but with all the other crazy stuff that’s gone on at Shujin, nothing would surprise me now!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-064.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Boy_4.jpg"/> With all the attention I’ve been getting, I’ve got no privacy. You can’t possibly understand. But there’s no time to relax. On the Phantom Thief fan sites, so many people need saving. The world is filled with villains. It’s up to the heroes to get rid of them! Yes, it’s my destiny...<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-Teacher_1.jpg"/> By the way, are the Phantom Thieves still big news? Our school doesn’t need more bad publicity...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-Girl_3.jpg"/> I’m really grateful to them for saving me. If they really exist, I’d like to cheer them on…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-Girl_5.jpg"/> Why don’t you try posting online on a fan site? You never know, they might be checking those out.<br/>
<br/>
Aww.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="111-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-Boy_1.jpg"/> Such a disgrace. A famous guy like him, exploiting his own pupil. But I want to know more about the Phantom Thieves. They did the same thing to Kamoshida.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Boy_5.jpg"/> What if they actually went to Shujin? I wonder if they’d join the basketball team.<br/>
<br/>
No thanks. I’ve had enough of them balls for a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I SEE YOU MAKOTO<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-Boy_7.jpg"/> Haha, I knew you’d say something like that. Maybe you should see if you can join the Phantom Thieves.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="117-073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="118-Mafia.png"/> It’s better that it’s early, idiot. There’s a lot more high schoolers around this time of day. People are more careful at night, too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-Man_Trying_To_Look_Cool.jpg"/> I get you… Meaning there’s more idiots who’d fall for our scams. <br/>
<br/>
That seemed shady. Better not tell anyone about it!<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-YusukeChat.jpg"/> What is this about a student council president?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-AnnChat.png"/> The one at our school has kinda been keeping tabs on us. I think she’s suspicious of us.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Are you sure it is not merely a result of Ryuji’s general misconduct?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-RyujiChat.png"/> Shuddup!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Though to be honest, the three of you most certainly stand out. Do try to be careful.<br/>

Today’s headlines are… “Calling Card at Madarame Exhibit!” The police are evaluating whether this is a true threat or a prank. “Scam Outbreak in Shibuya!” Students are the primary victims.

Indeed, we’re easily manipulated by the names we see. However, this world is filled with fake names. For instance, this creature, which you know well. It’s called the red king crab, but it has a form that a crab should not have. Hamiru-kun, look at this picture. What are red king crabs most biologically close to?<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Morgana.png"/> I saw some kind of paste like that in the fridge at Leblanc… but it’s not often you see real crab meat. Hey, why don’t we get sushi for our next celebration?<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Well, I can understand why you feel that way...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-AnnChat.png"/> That’s just how things are now, but if we keep doing stuff like this, that will definitely change.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="151-Boy_8.jpg"/> This isn’t the responsibility of the student council. This is frightening for us too… Principal Kobayakawa called you in yesterday, right? Did he tell you anything about this?<br/>

That’s all the information I have on them right now… Sorry. For now, I’ll make a post on the Phan-Site and ask for any more details people might know.<br/>

That is why I intend on people watching here for quite some time. Please contact me if anything important comes up.<br/>
<br/>
Oh boo, we can’t form a Confidant yet. Well, even if we have that request we can’t fulfill yet, we should head to Mementos. Why? Well… I won’t mince words. We need a lot of money coming up. There’s a few massive (and unfortunately, totally unavoidable for the sake of maximum efficiency) expenses coming up, including getting at least one SP Adhesive 3 from Takemi before the next Palace, which is both extremely long and very short on safe rooms. If we use most of the SP items we’ve stockpiled, we might not need it, but I’d prefer not to do that. How much do we need? I’ll tell you in the next update. Just know… it’s a lot.<br/>

I don’t know if she’s just lying, but I choose to believe that she’s not and she’s been actually reading and enjoying that book while attempting to stalk us, because it’s pretty adorable.<br/>
