<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Girl_5.jpg"/> Why don’t we get tea? The diner in Shibuya serves Frui-Tea. It smells good, it’s great for your skin, and it totally increases your charm!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Girl_1.jpg"/> <b>Frui-Tea</b>? What a cute name! Sounds yummy! Being stylish starts from the inside out, after all. Guess I’ll try some.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> <b>Frui-Tea</b>, huh… Sounds like a hip drink that’s real popular with the ladies. You want to try some?<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> I see… Well, you should keep an open mind. If it tastes good and makes you more stylish, might as well, right? It might be a good idea to boost your charm by drinking <b>Frui-Tea</b> whenever you’re at the diner.<br/>

Charismatic rulers and warlords with the command of a thousand men may have their own appeal… ...But personally, I think that the strategists who support them can’t be ignored. Now then, Hamiru-kun. In the book, Zhuge Liang of Shu is famous for his exploits during the Battle of Red Cliffs… ...But do you know what Chinese dish Zhuge Liang is credited for inventing?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I’ve never heard of half of these!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Inui.png"/> That’s right. The answer is baozi. At the time, one region would use a person’s head as an offering to quell an overflowing river. But Zhuge Liang made a baozi in the shape of a head as a substitute.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Becky.png"/> I told you that the story about my sick little sister was a lie… You know you’re being used for money… and you still request me?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-016.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Becky.png"/> Are you… an extreme masochist or something? You really are one strange kid… I’m a mediocre teacher and a mediocre maid… And yet, you listen to everything I have to say… ...You’re the complete opposite of me. I don’t even properly attend to my students’ needs. ……<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Becky.png"/> ...An “apology.” There was a student named Takase at the school I taught at before Shujin. Takase-kun was considered a problem child, since he had the lowest grades and skipped school a lot. So I was put in charge of guiding him… or rather, pushing him to transfer to another school. But when I got to know him, I realized that he wasn’t a problem child after all. ...In fact, he was working several part-time jobs just so he could cover his living expenses. His relatives took him in when his parents died, so he had to make money to support himself. He couldn’t attend school every day, but he was motivated to study. That’s why I decided to tutor him. After I started working with him, his grades started to improve, slowly but surely. But I was told that it was wrong to only help certain students and not others… Then a strange rumor about him being a juvenile delinquent began to circulate. And on top of that, I got called into the principal’s office… He threatened me… saying that I’d be dismissed if I continued to tutor Takase-kun.<br/>
<br/>
Yikes.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-019.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Becky.png"/> But you could say the same about me. I got scared… of losing my job, and of having rumors spread about me. So… I canceled our upcoming tutoring sessions… Takase-kun was on his way to one of his part-time jobs when I told him…<br/>
<br/>
Uh-oh.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Becky.png"/> Out of all days, it was New Year’s Eve, and it had been pouring rain all day… And… he died in a car crash.<br/>
<br/>
Well… fuck. This got absurdly depressing.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Becky.png"/> He sounded so depressed when I told him that I couldn’t tutor him anymore… But then he said that it was no big deal because he had to work anyway, so I wouldn’t feel bad. If only I had kept my promise to him...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Becky.png"/> Takase-kun was exhausted from the tutoring sessions and working at all his part-time jobs… His guardians blamed me for the accident, saying it was all my fault that he was so tired… They said that they were going to sue me and take the issue to the media and Board of Education. I wouldn’t have been accused of a crime, but if word had gotten out, the school would’ve been done for. ...I wanted to continue teaching, no matter what. So I ended up paying them the “apology” money so they wouldn’t sue me or say anything.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Becky.png"/> It was my indecisiveness that backed him into a corner, and I blame myself every day. I know paying them isn’t going to bring him back, but it’s the only way I can atone for my sins.<br/>
<br/>
That’s some hot bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Becky.png"/> It seems like his guardians are satisfied with our arrangement, so...<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Becky.png"/> I have to keep my distance to avoid hurting others, so I don’t meddle in my students’ lives. I’ve been coming here because of a random twist of fate, but we should say goodbye as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Becky.png"/> Hamiru-kun… You’re really not the type to back down, are you? Haha… I guess we’re in this together, now that I told you the whole story, right? ...Yeah. I’ll see what I can do about the other teachers so you can get free periods with them, too.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, those free periods you’ve been giving me have been so helpful, all zero of them.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Becky.png"/> ...I look forward to continuing our relationship.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Protag.png"/> <i>I feel like my relationship with Kawakami has deepened...</i><br/>

<br/>
A mild cough? Welp, it’s been nice knowing you Kawakami.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Becky.png"/> Oh my, this room is sooo dusty! Even though I wipe the place squeaky clean every visit… Well, I guess it’s all for you, Master. I’ll work hard to earn my keep! ♥<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It’s worse than I thought. She clearly has days to live.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Becky.png"/> Oh, uh, wooow! It’s so dusty! If my cough is already this bad… Maybe we’d be better off tearing this place down than trying to clean it? Well, the shabbi-- I mean, chicness of this room is truly its charm, so let’s keep it as-is! All right, I have to go. ♥ I’ll be eagerly awaiting your next request, Master! ♥<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> Wasn’t that Kawakami on the PA? There’s no way that announcement was real… It must have been the signal! Kawakami’s graciously given us this free time, so we’d better put it to good use. So, what’s the plan?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We finally get some time off in class. This isn’t scripted, we just got extremely lucky that an opportunity arose the day after we unlocked this Confidant ability. <br/>
<br/>
Reading lets us read a book, making infiltration tools lets us craft (and gives us Proficiency, as per usual), sleeping gives us points in a random Confidant (including story-based ones like Igor and ones that don’t require points like Tora or Mishima, both of which end up being useless) or, apparently, points in a random stat, and studying on your own gives you Knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We’ll finish The Illusory Popess.<br/>

Yep, good ol’ <s>Kamurocho</s> Shinjuku!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> Apparently this place was a hotbed for criminals and illegal immigrants before they installed surveillance cameras… I heard there were quite a few brothels as well.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> This is the first time I’ve actually been here myself though. Regardless, it’s become far safer now than it used to be. Of course, the surveillance cameras played a substantial role in that… But it was mainly thanks to the police efforts to clean up the area. Even so, there’s no way to eradicate crime entirely. It seems the operations nowadays are only better hidden… Anyway, seeing is believing, yes? Come on, let’s have a look around.<br/>
<br/>

He mentioned how “his girls” get paid a lot to wear cute dresses… All I wanted was to ask if any Shujin students worked there… but he nearly dragged me inside with him. If you hadn’t been there to rescue me, I…<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> I’m glad nobody had to get hurt though. Hm, I guess that’s how they do it… I’ve learned something new today. Oh, and thanks again. It seems you have a knack for helping me out. I hope I can do the same for you someday. <br/>

And we get Baton Pass for Makoto.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> That aside… Even though this is a shopping district, there are absolutely no students around here. And definitely no Shujin students… though I guess they wouldn’t come in uniform either way. Well then...<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-MishimaSummer.png"/> I did end up talking about how expensive it is to run our little organization though. The donations I got after that were pretty… generous, to say the least.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh jeez, Mishima…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-MishimaSummer.png"/> But I guess our loving sponsors just wanted to show some support! Not bad for strategic management, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-MishimaSummer.png"/> What do you mean? Everyone was glad to donate if it meant supporting the Phantom Thieves. Speaking of which, the bill for our meal here is a fine place to start taking advantage of that support.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-MishimaSummer.png"/> I’ve seen on the news that using donations for stuff other than what’s publicized is a serious crime…<br/>
<br/>
Your only thought here is that you might get in trouble? Jesus, Mishima.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-MishimaSummer.png"/> Food is definitely an acceptable business expense… but can the same be said of an expensive buffet…? The more I think about this whole thing, the less I think we should use the donations here. I mean, people would get mad at a politician for using tax money for personal affairs. The same probably applies to the Phantom Thieves. I guess returning the money would be the best choice...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-MishimaSummer.png"/> Yeah. We really need to make sure we keep the image of the Phantom Thieves clean in our fans’ minds. I think I’ll return the money and thank the Phandom for their generosity. They’ll love that! It might be a waste of some nice resources, but it’s all good as long as it boosts our popularity, right? Man, maybe I was born to do this strategy stuff… I’m honestly getting pretty good at it.<br/>
<br/>
Right.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-MishimaSummer.png"/> Don’t worry, I’m still gathering info on the forum too. I actually have a few solid leads right now. Everything so far has been close to home, but these next ones are gonna blow your socks off!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Protag.png"/> <i>Mishima seems particularly enthusiastic today...</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-MishimaSummer.png"/> So if we’re returning the money… how are we gonna cover our meal? …… I’m flat broke...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-MishimaSummer.png"/> I guess let’s just go home.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-RyujiChat.png"/> We’ve been busy lately, so I wanna be able to at least relax on Sunday. Where would be a good place to go…? I know. Wanna try going to the fishing pond in Ichigaya?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> The <b>fishing pond</b>, huh? Sounds fun! So are you going there with Ryuji?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Sure, why not?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-RyujiChat.png"/> I hope the other fish’ll bite this easily! Let’s meet in Shinjuku tomorrow then. Night.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> They have lots of fish at the pond, right? I can’t wait!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The Ichigaya fishing pond lets us fish in our free time. I didn’t accept or didn’t receive this invitation in my first playthrough and never ended up unlocking this, though there are other ways. We probably won’t end up revisiting this place, so I should mention that we get Proficiency for fishing, and our current Proficiency determines how many times we can fish. There’s a trophy for catching the biggest fish, but again, we won’t be bothering.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-KawakamiJacket.png"/> Why are you sitting around like old men? Why don’t you go out and do something more exciting?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-RyujiYellow.png"/> Wha—Look who’s talkin’!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-KawakamiJacket.png"/> *sigh* Adults need time to themselves to unwind and clear their thoughts. You’ll understand soon enough, when you start working in the real world.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-RyujiYellow.png"/> Wow… Soundin’ real old there, Kawakami.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-KawakamiJacket.png"/> That’s MS. Kawakami to you!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-079.jpg"/><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-RyujiYellow.png"/> She’s hookin’ fish like crazy…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-KawakamiJacket.png"/> It’s easy. Just clear your mind and free yourself from negative thoughts.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-RyujiYellow.png"/> So the trick is not to think! ...How am I supposed to do that?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-RyujiYellow.png"/> I see. So when you get jaded like Kawakami, you’ll just naturally attract fish… ...Uhh, I don’t think that’s right.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-KawakamiJacket.png"/> It’s a nice, sunny Sunday. I didn’t think I’d be stuck fishing with you two on my day off. *sigh* Two troublemakers, and their no-good teacher… I guess we’re perfect for each other.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-RyujiYellow.png"/> She keeps gettin’ fish even as she nags… I’m impressed!<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-082.jpg"/><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-KawakamiJacket.png"/> Once again, it’s MS. Kawakami.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-RyujiYellow.png"/> Didn’t think I’d see somethin’ like that today… Guess we’ll head back.<br/>
<br/>
We got a bunch of points with both Ryuji and Kawakami, so that was a productive enough day.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-MishimaChat.png"/> The truth is, a younger student came to consult with me about something the other day.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-087.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-MishimaChat.png"/> Right!? From what he told me, money went missing from the register he was supposed to be in charge of. As such, he’s been falsely accused of stealing money from the store.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-MishimaChat.png"/> Yeah, this guy is like the most honest person I know. There’s now way he’d steal all that money. And well, I did some research into the store online… According to some rumors, the manager might be the one stealing the money… He’s the only person who checks the registers, after all… On top of that, some other staff members saw him taking cash out when he was calculating totals. Anyway, the guy’s name seems to be Nozomi Odo. I found it out when I looked into the store. Please, you gotta help this student!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> So the manager himself is taking the money, and then blackmailing the kid to pay him for it… That’s a dirty trick. Let’s talk about it at the hideout when we have the chance, OK?<br/>

I mentioned this before, but 20 years ago I was lucky enough to become a Diet member. However, I wanted to be a politician for all the wrong reasons. I wanted to be in a position of power, and I was obsessed with the glamorous lifestyle. I thought only of being popular. I truly was “No-Good Tora”… Learn from me. Don’t let being a member of the Diet be your only goal in life. Voters are much more sensible than we give them credit for. Being ambitious and striving to advance in the political world will change your outlook on life.<br/>
