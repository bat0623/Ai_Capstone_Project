Who’s got two thumbs and has to sort through another two hours of Mementos footage? ...I can’t finish that joke in this format.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> Let me check our intel… We’ll start with this one first… This one’s especially dangerous. This particular intel is on an <b>ex-mercenary assassin</b>. From what I can tell, he acts like a homeless man, but secretly carries out assassination contracts. If not even the police can deal with him… it’s time for us to step in. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnJacket.png"/> It’d be bad if we left such a dangerous guy out on the loose! We have to change his heart. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-MakotoCasual.png"/> We need to take down the evil that can’t be judged by the law! <br/>
<br/>
One.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> There are still more. This intel is on the <b>human incarnation of greed</b> who borrows money and runs off with it. He’s changed his name and even had surgery to change his face. Not even the police can catch him… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-MakotoCasual.png"/> When greed has gone that far, the only thing I can feel is pity. It seems it would be best if we helped change his heart. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnJacket.png"/> I’m for doing this too! We need to trigger a change of heart in them.<br/>
<br/>
Two.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> There are still more. This intel is on the <b>gamer boy’s helicopter mother</b>. Apparently the skilled boy we know from the arcade is troubled by his mother’s overbearing actions. So, we’re going to change her heart.<br/>
<br/>
Didn’t really sell us on why that one’s necessary, but okay!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-MakotoCasual.png"/> This is about that boy known as the King, right? I would never have guessed this was happening… Things sound pretty serious. Let’s get moving. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-RyujiCasual.png"/> Fine by me. <br/>
<br/>
Three.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> There are still more. This intel is on a <b>man who is making a fortune teller suffer</b>. He called himself the chairman of an organization, but he is nothing but a money-scamming fraud. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-YusukeJacket.png"/> This must be regarding Chihaya Mifune… the fortune teller you had mentioned before. To think she has been dragged into such dishonest cult… What a despicable money monger… We shall bring his true nature to light in Mementos.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnJacket.png"/> It seems tough, but I think we can accomplish this if you say we can! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> OK, it looks like we’re all ready to do this! We already told Mishima, so the forum post is up and running. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Four.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> There are still more. This is from the owner of the Central Street airsoft shop. Apparently an acquaintance is threatening him. This acquaintance, Tsuda, is… a professional. If we don’t hurry, Iwai will be in serious danger. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-RyujiCasual.png"/> That man’s pretty freakin’ scary… In any case, this time we’re goin’ up against a real criminal. He’ll be a worthy opponent. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnJacket.png"/> It seems tough, but I think we can accomplish this if you say we can! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> OK, it looks like we’re all ready to do this! We already told Mishima, so the forum post is up and running.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Five.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> There are still more. Remember that journalist Ohya who got us info on Kaneshiro? This is about <b>her boss</b>. He’s been harassing her, and keeping her from investigating the case in which her partner went missing. He has to know something that he doesn’t want other people knowing. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-YusukeJacket.png"/> Truth is the highest art for a journalist. To think someone would be so imprudent as to impede it… Let us lend Ohya our assistance so she can gather the news she needs. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-MakotoCasual.png"/> We need to take down the evil that can’t be judged by law! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> OK, it looks like we’re all ready to do this! We already told Mishima, so the forum post is up and running. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Six.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> There are still more. This intel is on the <b>parents</b> of Futaba’s friend Kana. They’ve forced Kana to take immoral jobs so they can pay off their debt. ...Ever since she was young, they’ve trampled over her life. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-FutabaJacket.png"/> I’m gonna crush them… I’ll save Kana-chan! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> That works for me too. OK, it looks like we’re all ready to do this! We already told Mishima, so the forum post is up and running. <br/>
<br/>
<b><i>Seven.</i></b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> No objections, right? Mm… we’re good to go if you’re OK with it. That’s a unanimous decision! <br/>
<br/>
And the cheater makes eight! Fuck me!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> Don’t you think the change of heart is more important? Well, the decision is up to you.<br/>
<br/>
Listen… shut up.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> At the moment, our target count in Mementos is 8. Well, let’s go. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> It looks like Mementos has expanded even further… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-YusukeFox.png"/> Hm? I thought public opinion of us determined Mementos expansion… and that has plummeted lately.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> Our notability must still be on the rise, even if it’s because of our currently bad reputation…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-AnnPanther.png"/> So we’re like a celeb who gets more famous because of scandals? I don’t like the sound of that… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> Either way, the further we go, the more powerful enemies we’ll meet. We need to be cautious in here. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-MakotoQueen.png"/> Even seeing it with my own two eyes doesn’t help it make any more sense… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-RyujiSkull.png"/> Uh, y’know this is a Palace, right? It’s not actually under Shibuya. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-MakotoQueen.png"/> I suppose that’s true…<br/>
<br/>
<b>RYUJI: ONE<br/>
MAKOTO: ZERO</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-YusukeFox.png"/> Hm, is the scale of a Palace proportional to its ruler’s desires and distortions? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> Basically. Hence, the bigger the target, the longer it takes to secure our infiltration route. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-YusukeFox.png"/> Yes, but the size of this place easily supersedes that of any Palace we’ve visited up until now. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Morgana.png"/> That’s because this is the Palace of the public. It’s incomparable to anything on an individual level. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-MakotoQueen.png"/> So the size of this place reflects the distortions of the public… What a depressing thought… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-RyujiSkull.png"/> That’s why we gotta reform society, yeah? All this shit down here just makes that even more worth doin’! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-AnnPanther.png"/> You know, sometimes I envy that personality of yours, Skull… ...Only sometimes though. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-RyujiSkull.png"/> You didn’t hafta add that last part! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Before we even get into a target area, Morgana levels up and learns Wind Boost to replace the useless Wind Break. His Wind attacks will now be 25% stronger.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-RyujiSkull.png"/> Somethin’ about this guy tells me he’s nuts. I guess I shouldn’t be surprised. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-MakotoQueen.png"/> He’s threatening Iwai… He’s doing this because he’s getting desperate, right? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-YusukeFox.png"/> He seriously intends to kill someone. We’d better change his heart immediately. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-AnnPanther.png"/> It’s scary, but we gotta do it! <br/>

Having fun listening to this grown-ass yakuza dude squeal like a little kid about how annoyed he is that he’s not being taken seriously.<br/>

(We take him down in three moves, he gets off a Bufudyne or whatever. He can use Evil Smile to inflict Fear and then Ghastly Wail to instant-kill anyone with the ailment, but he obviously never gets the chance to do any of that)<br/>

The young, college graduates in the Hashiba Clan laugh behind my back. Hehehe… Even the world of the yakuza’s been taken over by the intellectuals. That’s why I had to make this transaction work, no matter what. Even if it meant taking advantage of my subordinate… Mune… The Hong Kong mafia pulled the carpet under me. It’s what I get for breaking the yakuza code. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-AnnPanther.png"/> If we let him go on like this, so many more people will end up unhappy! <br/>

So, this guy uses a lot of Psy and Curse moves, including the instant-kill Mudoon, which is very annoying. Thankfully, Ryuji has both Endure and Protect, meaning that he can survive one instant-kill and take one for Maaku if need be. He’ll also use Brainwash on people, but everyone in the party has Harisen Recovery so status ailments are not the debilitating factor they once were. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Fukurai.jpg"/> I was going to join a vocational school when I first came to Tokyo, but I ended up getting scammed… I spent all that money on what I thought was tuition. I was all alone, hopeless in the city… The police just laughed. “Those ads are obvious scams. You were dumb enough to fall for them?” That’s why I vowed to not let myself get tricked like that again. I won’t be a victim anymore. If it ever happened again, I’d be the one doing the deceiving! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Fukurai.jpg"/> I… I never really thought about it much. I guess when it comes right down to it, I really am just a dumb guy… Hahaha… haha… The maiden’s powers are real. That’s why I brought her on. I’m the only one guilty of lying. And I took advantage of the two of us happening to meet again.<br/>
<br/>
Meet again? What?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Fukurai.jpg"/> I’ve been wanting to apologize to her for a while… I’m so sorry, Chi-chan...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The Prophet’s Hand is a weapon for Makoto with only 10 Attack, but a high chance to cause Brainwash. Speaking of Brainwash, I’ve heard people say it’s a good idea to Brainwash enemies to make negotiation easier, but every time I’ve tried this they haven’t joined me. Weird.<br/>
<br/>

He does not. This is actually kind of an interesting fight mechanically, though. See, he’ll start the fight by casting Megidola, which will deplete almost all of his SP. Then, he’ll use party-wide Physical moves (or just do nothing) until Invigorate 3 restores his SP so he can do it again. He also blocks or straight up absorbs a lot of elements, so he’s kind of tricky.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Honjo.jpg"/> I can’t oppose the higher-ups. It’s easier to not rock the boat. Mass media is just another corporation, really. Passion for journalism won’t pay the bills. It’s useless, just useless to chase after your ideals… <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Honjo.jpg"/> ...She’s really incredible. No matter what people say to her, she’ll never give up on finding the truth… I found her naive passion to be so annoying. It reminds me of all that pain I felt in the past. Back in the past, before I gave up. Before my passion rotted away and my wife cheated on me…<br/>

This dude will use more Curse, including instant-kill moves, which is something of a problem as Akechi is weak to Curse despite his ability to use those skills. He’ll also use Stomach Blow to inflict Hunger, multi-hit party-wide Physical attacks, and Life Leech to steal our HP. It’s weak to Electricity, though. I switch out Akechi for Yusuke in an attempt to capitalize on this for Baton Passes, but it dies before I am able to.<br/>

Thermopylae is a garbage skill that increases the entire party’s Attack, Defense, and Agility for three turns. How is that garbage, you ask? It certainly sounds amazing, but it’s only usable <i>while you’re ambushed</i>. Considering how infrequently you get ambushed in this game combined with the fact that most of the time at this point Futaba will just Position Hack us out of it, it’s an obscene waste of a skill slot. Why the hell would you need to be raising all three of the party’s parameters in a non-boss fight anyway!? <br/>

Now, this next tradeoff is kind of a hard one. Some would suggest I get rid of Defense Master (automatic Rakukaja at the start of battle), but instead I’m getting rid of Flash Bomb (Medium Physical to all enemies with a chance of Dizzy). While it means she’s going to be dealing solely Nuke damage outside of her melee attacks due to her lack of a Physical skill after Flash Bomb, that skill was already pretty obsolete. Besides, now her Nuclear skills will do 25% more damage.<br/>

These guys can be a bit tricky, but most of the difficulty for me came from trying to exploit the money grinding trick.

If you confuse Mrs. Magario, she’ll give a tidy sum, same as usual. But Mr. Magario will only ever give 1 yen. I have no idea why this is the case. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, these guys can put you to sleep, or just use extremely powerful Gun attacks to <i>make</i> you “sleep.” The Mrs. can even use Spirit Leech to steal <i>one hundred</i> of our precious SP away! Outside of that, the dude uses Curse and the lady uses Fire. Simple enough.<br/>

<br/>
We have to <i>stop</i> her, you guys! She did a <i>bad!</i> ...No, I can’t elaborate!<br/>

Oda can put us to sleep with Lullaby (something of a running theme today) and use that to score sick Technical hits when she follows up with multi-hit Physical.<br/>

As depicted here. <br/>

Trying again, we see that this fight is going to be really long and tedious because while she’s weak to fire, she doesn’t take a ton of damage from Almighty, meaning we’re better off swapping in Ann and Yusuke, hitting her weakness, and then Baton Passing over to Yusuke for the double buff over All-out Attacking. After almost eight minutes (!) of this, we finish her off. Not before she charges up and almost kills us even through a guard, though. <br/>

Deathbound is a skill that deals Medium Physical to all enemies 1-2 times. While it can be better than Swift Strike if both of its strikes hit, in practice that’s a big if. The guaranteed 3-4 hits of Swift Strike make Deathbound kind of worthless, but I’m not quite willing to give up on it yet so I slot it in for Headbutt, a skill that never made any sense in the first place. If I’m the one headbutting them, why do <i>they</i> get hit with Forget?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Next, Ann gets Agidyne, an upgrade to Agilao, making her the first party member to learn a third-tier elemental spell outside of Akechi, who I don’t count because I forgot about him when I began this sentence. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Finally, Akechi learns Eigaon to replace Eiga. More Curse is nice, and Eigaon actually has one of my favorite skill animations in the game. Hopefully I’ll remember to show it off later. <br/>

And that’s over with, thank christ. That was the last big Mementos trip in the game, so we don’t have to worry about any more mega Mementos updates in the future. It won’t be the last time we come here, but we’ll at least be in and out pretty quick, comparatively. You have no goddamn idea how nice it feels to get this weight off of my shoulders.
