<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Boy_13.jpg"/> I do have some Big Bang Burger coupons, but we… probably shouldn’t go there anymore, huh? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Boy_5.jpg"/> Uh, no. I hear you’ll have a psychotic breakdown if you eat there. I mean, haven’t all of Okumura’s enemies died in strange ways? Maybe he feeds them poisoned burgers… What a monster.<br/>
<br/>
Why would he poison his own customers, <i>idiot?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Boy_13.jpg"/> You know, I voted Okumura on the Phan-Site… The Phantom Thieves have a duty to punish bad people. I hope they take care of him soon. <br/>

<br/>
Back to school! …More talking.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Girl_1.jpg"/> All the craziness that’s happening is freaking me out. You think the Phantom Thieves’ll save us again? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Girl_5.jpg"/> Hmm, they’re probably too busy for us right now. First, they have to focus on Okumura! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-006.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-005.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> That’s the spirit! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Chatter.jpg"/> Hamiru-kun drew this? It’s like, totally perfect. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Chatter.jpg"/> So Hamiru’s part of the Phandom too? This is awesome! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Chatter.jpg"/> It kinda feels like the Phantom Thieves are gods or something. They’re fighting for all of us! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Chatter.jpg"/> I wish they’d pick up the pace though. I can’t wait much longer!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Chatter.jpg"/> They should just get moving on that shithead executive! Enough loafing around! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Chatter.jpg"/> Phantom Thieves! Phantom Thieves!<br/>
<br/>
Oh dear. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Not helping, cat!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-010.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
How is this news just now getting out?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Newspaper.jpg"/> The newspaper club must stand strong despite it all. Go ahead and tell me what you want to know.<br/>
<br/>
But aren’t you the entire newspaper club…? Eh, whatever. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Newspaper.jpg"/> Some say the Phantom Thieves are responsible, but it’s apparently confirmed to be suicide.<br/>
<br/>
By a liar!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Newspaper.jpg"/> I wonder if there was anything we could have done to prevent this from happening… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Newspaper.jpg"/> Big Bang is attracting a lot of interest. It’s already pretty well known among high school students. Employee exploitation by companies is a social issue, so it might be interesting to do a feature on it. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Newspaper.jpg"/> I’m surprised you know about her! Most people don’t know that Okumura-senpai is the daughter of the Okumura who runs that company.<br/>
<br/>
Because they’re all idiots!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Newspaper.jpg"/> People find out this company is exploiting its employees, and some look to the Phantom Thieves. The extremists are asking them to strike already. Maybe the Phantom Thieves are tired of it by now. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Girl_2.jpg"/> Yeah, I’ve seen her around. She takes care of the flowers in front of the school. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Girl_4.jpg"/> I heard she’s engaged. Can you believe that? She’s still in high school! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Girl_2.jpg"/> She lives in a different world. This school is just too weird… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Ikesugi.jpg"/> Oh, that was you. I knew I felt someone looking at me. Well.. We could start off as friends.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Stalker.jpg"/> Yes…! This is my chance! Er, I mean, uh… Thank you… very much!<br/>
<br/>
Mogami needed two full months to say <i>that?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Boy_5.jpg"/> Who cares? Actually, shouldn’t you worry about how this might affect recommendations? I’m seriously going to be angry if I can’t get a recommendation because of all this! <br/>
<br/>
Shujin is a wonderful school full of compassionate students and caring faculty. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Boy_12.jpg"/> It’s crazy how it all gets back to Shujin Academy again. So President Okumura is their next target? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Boy_5.jpg"/> I’m sure he is since he’s hit the top rank so fast. I can’t wait to see him break down and grovel. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Boy_3.jpg"/> I guess that’s what happens when you cut down labor costs too much. Business management is tough work.<br/>
<br/>
“Treat your workers like human beings” is real tough, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Boy_5.jpg"/> That vicious transfer student,--<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Protag.png"/> <u>I’m right here, dude.</u><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Boy_5.jpg"/> --a suicide attempt, sex crimes by a teacher, our principal died…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Boy_1.jpg"/> You’re right. That is a lot to happen in just one year. Maybe this school really is cursed. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Boy_5.jpg"/> That makes sense. A curse would explain why we can’t get any decent members or win any games.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Boy_8.jpg"/> The food there is cheap, but it’s filling. It might suck if Big Bang weren’t around anymore. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Boy_1.jpg"/> Nah, bad guys should be punished. And those press conferences where they apologize are fun to watch. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Gaudy_Female_Student.jpg"/> You don’t like places like that either, do you, Sensei? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Teacher_1.jpg"/> Of course not. But it isn’t always clear whether or not something can be considered exploitation. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Marx.jpg"/> Whaaat? Really? Then maybe we should just get rid of all companies! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Boy_4.jpg"/> If I had only paid more attention. I failed to save him as a Phantom Thief of Hearts. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Boy_4.jpg"/> It’s kind of you to say that. Don’t worry. I won’t make that kind of mistake ever again. Yes, this is a test from fate. I’ll do all I can to live up to everyone’s faith in me! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-026.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We haven’t hung out with Ryuji in… *checks* ...literally four months. Let’s rectify that! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-RyujiSummer.png"/> Huh…? You sure we’re gonna be OK not headin’ in? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-RyujiSummer.png"/> ...Eh, I guess it ain’t gonna hurt gettin’ a change of pace. So, uh… I’ve been thinkin’ about what to do with the track team… But I realized I’m not the kinda guy to come up with epic plans that can save the day. So, I think I’m gonna do this the one way I know how. Can you come with? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-RyujiSummer.png"/> I’ve gotta tell Nakaoka and Takeishi what’s goin’ on with that asshole of a teacher… I mean, there’s no way the track team’s gonna make a comeback without them. Come with me to the courtyard, man. <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-RyujiSummer.png"/> You prolly didn’t realize, but I recorded Yamauchi’s whole convo back at the monja shop! I’m a genius, I know.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That’s your whole plan? You intimated you had something… I don’t know… dumber up your sleeve a minute ago. Also, I’m shocked you managed to figure out how to record a phone call.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-RyujiSummer.png"/> Anyways, uh… I might need some backup here. Can you stick around?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-034.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Takeishi.jpg"/> Nakaoka!? Wh-What the hell!? Are you guys gonna gang up on me!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-RyujiSummer.png"/> Dude, chill. I just wanna talk. Listen. This here is what’s really goin’ on with the track team.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Phone.jpg"/> …… And the best part is, not only are Takeishi’s parents loaded, but his mother’s the president of the PTA. …… But until then, he can show the others the value of obedience. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Nakaoka.jpg"/> Is this real…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-RyujiSummer.png"/> It’s Yamauchi’s voice, ain’t it? And on top of that, shit’s gone down just like he said. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Takeishi.jpg"/> …… Yamauchi’s right. I don’t have talent… I’m not like you guys. I ran so damn hard, but you two were always so far ahead… How’s a guy like me supposed to succeed? How am I supposed to be proud of myself!? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Takeishi.jpg"/> My dad always talks about how proud he is of his son… He told everyone I’d get a track scholarship like he did… That I’d follow in his footsteps as a second-generation Taisei grad… <br/>
<br/>
From a cursory Google, Taisei (full name Taisei Gakuin University) appears to be a private university in Osaka, though it only gained its current name in 2003, so I’m not sure it’s the one this guy is referring to because his dad would probably use the old name. Also, the one I found isn’t actually ranked that high in terms of Japan’s universities, so actually it’s pretty unlikely that this kid is dying to get in anyway. I’m just going to assume they made a school up.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Takeishi.jpg"/> That’s why I listened to Yamauchi. He said if I was the captain, he’d write me a great letter of rec… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-RyujiSummer.png"/> ...So you trusted what he was sayin’ about Nakaoka ‘cause of stupid crap like that?<br/>
<br/>
Ryuji: master of tact.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Takeishi.jpg"/> You couldn’t know how I feel… Nobody does!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-RyujiSummer.png"/> Like hell I don’t know! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Takeishi.jpg"/> Sakamoto… <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-RyujiSummer.png"/> Maybe you should stop tryin’ to live for them, and just try livin’ for yourself. You think you gotta betray people to be proud? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Takeishi.jpg"/> W-Well, I… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-RyujiSummer.png"/> If that’s seriously what you think, you’re wrong! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-RyujiSummer.png"/> I mean, the bastard’s never been interested in track before… But you kept quiet. You knew he was walkin’ all over you, and you just let him do it. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Nakaoka.jpg"/> ...Yeah. I was afraid… Without Yamauchi, we still wouldn’t have a team… or a place to belong. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-RyujiSummer.png"/> ...You missed runnin’ that bad? Y’know… it ain’t so scary not havin’ a place you belong. You can kinda be free that way. If anything, I’m more scared of bein’ a crappy person. I mean, I used to be like you guys… afraid, lyin’ to myself…<br/>
<br/>
“Man, I’m glad I’m not <i>awful</i> anymore, like you guys are.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-RyujiSummer.png"/> That is, before I met this dude.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-043.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-RyujiSummer.png"/> So… if you wanna hit me or something, go ahead. I’m ready. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Takeishi.jpg"/> In that case… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Nakaoka.jpg"/> If you insist. <br/>

<br/>
Woohoo! Violence toward a domestic abuse victim as comedy!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Nakaoka.jpg"/> Hahaha, I’m actually starting to feel a little better already. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Takeishi.jpg"/> Me too. I think I can finally put all of this behind me. Nakoaka… I’m sorry.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Nakaoka.jpg"/> I’m sorry too. So… you wanna bring back the track team? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Takeishi.jpg"/> Hell yeah! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-049.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-RyujiSummer.png"/> For real though… you were a big help. You were pushin’ me to be cool that whole time. It’s kinda like I was doin’ a sprint… and you were runnin’ next to me. <br/>

And now Ryuji gets Endure. Given that he’s pretty much a mainstay in our party at this point, this will be very helpful. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-058.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Haughty.png"/> Haha, I appreciate your honesty. I also can’t deny the excitement I feel in my heart. It’s clear that they have power. They have an ethical obligation to use it wisely. The pressure and expectations that burden exceptional people… I know it well, hahaha. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-TV.jpg"/> He has testified that he claimed to be a phantom thief in his post because he wanted the attention.<br/>
<br/>
Wait, if he was just arrested, how could he have also testified? The more formal definition of that word specifically relates to statements made in court.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-TV.jpg"/> Police have warned people to be cautious of crimes that exploit the Phantom Thieves bandwagon. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-MorganaSquint.png"/> I wish people would stop pulling stunts like this. But maybe this happens once you become famous. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-Sojiro.png"/> Ugh, my head hurts…<br/>

<br/>
...two drink glasses, two coasters, and some fucking ice stones for some goddamn reason (????)! Sure, why not?<br/>
<br/>
What were we talking about? Oh right, bad parenting.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Iwai.png"/> Not only did I have to leave the clan, but now I’m stuck runnin’ this shop I don’t even like. *chuckle* Every day’s an uphill battle. I still haven’t managed to tell Kaoru I was in the yakuza though… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Iwai.png"/> ...Lemme ask you somethin’. How would you feel if you found out your parents were wrapped up in some dirty shit?<br/>
<br/>
Well, it’s implied our parents kinda suck already, so I doubt we’d care that much.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Iwai.png"/> That’s how my mom was. She’d spend every night out drinkin’, runnin’ around town with all sortsa guys.<br/>
<br/>
“And then when she got home she was mercilessly slutshamed by <i>me!</i> It was disgraceful all around!”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Iwai.png"/> I couldn’t stand to see her destroy herself like that. Often I wished I could’ve had someone else as my mom.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, yeah, she sounds pretty irresponsible, but the part about the guys just seems kinda unnecessary, Iwai. I thought you were cool.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Iwai.png"/> So… I didn’t wanna make Kaoru go through the same thing. I wanted to make sure he had a good childhood. That’s why I left the clan. I did everythin’ according to the code, but now Tsuda’s draggin’ me back… Once he remembered I run this fake gun shop, he came by askin’ me to make custom models for him. <br/>
<br/>
We should get Iwai and Ryuji together to plot their ongoing war against the letter “G.”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Iwai.png"/> Truth is, Tsuda’s got all sortsa dirt. Not just on what happened when Kaoru was a baby, but on me and the rest of my family too. Who knows what’d happen if Kaoru learned the truth… When it’s all said and done, he’s gonna try and take everythin’ I have. If word gets out about my past, people’re gonna treat Kaoru like he’s no different than me. After all, everyone knows shitty parents end up makin’ shitty kids… And once he’s got that stigma, he’ll be stuck with it. When shit goes wrong, he’ll always be the one who gets blamed. That’s how it was with me.<br/>
<br/>
So, you’re trying to prevent Kaoru or anyone else from finding out that you used to be in the yakuza. But <i>you still work at a shady-ass fake gun shop</i>. How is that better? Also, I feel like it’d be really easy to find out you used to be in the yakuza! You even have a neck tattoo, dude! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Iwai.png"/> ...That’s why I turned to the yakuza. Nobody else would accept me. That’s also why I can’t turn Tsuda down. He’s just got too much power. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-072.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Iwai.png"/> I bet Kaoru’s sick of havin’ a weak-ass dad like me. Anyways, I was tryin’ to stall Tsuda with bullshit prototypes while I figured out a way to stop him… But that bastard’s real good as keepin’ his cards close to his chest. Plus, he caught wind of what I was tryin’ to do and started keepin’ tabs on me 24/7. <br/>
<br/>
Well, that can’t be economical for him.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Iwai.png"/> Thankfully, that’s just about when you showed up, kid. *sigh* Sorry for bringin’ all that shit up out of the blue. ...You prolly don’t want anythin’ to do with me after that, huh? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-074.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Iwai likes it when we neg him, apparently. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Iwai.png"/> Oh, right. Just remembered I never gave you a reward for that info. Hm… How about I give you a discount on the special menu? That should keep you quiet for a while. Pretty good deal, huh?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Protag.png"/> <i>It feels like my bond with Iwai is growing even deeper...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-076.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh hey, a discount for the service we’ve never once used and may never end up using because as it turns out it’s not very good. How swell. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Iwai.png"/> Kaoru’s been eatin’ a ton lately after cram school. He’s prolly gonna have another growth spurt soon. Anyways, I’m closin’ up for today. You should head home too. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Protag.png"/> <i>I feel like helping Iwai with his work has honed my <b>Proficiency</b>...</i><br/>

<br/>
It’s literally my favorite fucking movie, woman.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-Kawakami.png"/> The word “robot” comes from the Czech word “robota.”<br/>
<br/>
Oh.<br/>

Holy shit dude, what the hell is wrong with you? Using internet-speak or memes in real life is something I thought we just fucking understood was verboten as members of a civilized society. The only person you should be discussing that shit with is your goddamn <i>psychiatrist</i>. I let Futaba off the hook for it because she’s socially stunted, what’s your excuse?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="144-102.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE<br/>
<br/>
...I’m <i>shaking</i> right now. Fu--Mothe--Shi--Godda--Hm. None of these are working. Excuse me for a moment.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="145-Creative.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...”Cock” isn’t that creative, guys. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, so listen here… *consults notes* ...fucktrumpet. I treat you with respect—not a lot, but certainly more than you deserve—and you bring this <b>curse</b> upon my <b>family!?</b> What the hell is wrong with you!? This is the end, asshat. You ever set foot near either one of us again I may actually murder you, Mishima. No court will possibly convict me. Say one more word and I’ll leap across this fucking table, so help me...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="132-NishimaSummer.png"/> H-Huh? That’s all you took from that conversation…?<br/>
<br/>
*low pitched whirring sound* Oh, hey. Thanks to a flaw in my programming, it seems my “Rage” value overflowed and reset back to zero! How quaint!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="146-103.jpg"/><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="124-FutabaTankTop.png"/> Ah, I’ve got it! The overwhelmingly forgettable appearance, generic speech style, and total lack of sex appeal… Nishima… Are you an NPC!?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="147-104.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
So, the “correct” answer, “He’s the protagonist,” gives us three notes. “Savage” gives us none. Picking the third option here will give us enough points to proceed to the next rank, while the second will not. However, not only is the second option much funnier than the third, I’m not going to fucking compliment Mishima, are you insane!? <br/>
<br/>
So, yes, I am actually, legitimately derailing this playthrough for the sake of giving Mishima a single minor burn. It’s worth it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="124-FutabaTankTop.png"/> But it’d be even more savage to lie about what he is! And besides, NPCs are an important piece in the jigsaw puzzle of gaming! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="132-NishimaSummer.png"/> You’re not making this any better…! And more importantly, my name isn’t Nishima…!<br/>
<br/>
He doesn’t even correct her if you don’t pick this option. Laaaame.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="124-FutabaTankTop.png"/> Anyway, I’m glad you spawned here! I killed two promises with one Nishima today! “Learn about my generation” and “have a normal conversation with a stranger my age”! Aw yeah! I think I gained a ton of EXP on this adventure. And it’s all ‘cause you brought me here, Maaku. Thanks! <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="154-MishimaSummer.png"/> And no, I’m not saying that out of jealousy. I heard a rumor that a famous idol fell into his clutches… You need to act, on behalf of her fans!<br/>
<br/>
...Are <i>you</i> one of her fans? <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="154-MishimaSummer.png"/> Anyway, isn’t it your job to listen to the public’s wishes? You have to change his heart! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="164-119.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="154-MishimaSummer.png"/> Well? Pretty good tactic, huh? Aren’t I an amazing producer? Just you wait… I’m gonna put the Phantom Thieves on the map! You’ll practically be swimming in requests! <br/>

<br/>
Uhhhhhhh<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="154-MishimaSummer.png"/> Hey, take out your phone. <br/>

<br/>
Sure thing, bud. Sure thing.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="154-MishimaSummer.png"/> The Phantom Thieves’ success is thanks to me… and the Phantom Thieves are changing the world… That means I’m the one who’s responsible for those changes… <br/>

<br/>
Well, this has been a one-two punch of some of Mishima’s Most Embarrassing Hits, but at least we can go to bed, end the update, and not have to see any more of him for the time bei--<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="176-131.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-MorganaSquint.png"/> Huh…? Who could that be at this hour…? <br/>

DAMMIT<br/>
<br/>
MISHIMA<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="178-MishimaChat.png"/> Are you into that stuff, Hamiru? Oh, right. You probably need all sorts of tools like that for your Phantom Thieves work. Well, how about it? It’ll be the perfect way to spend the day off! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> Akihabara, huh… Well do you want to go with Mishima to the <b>electronics shop</b>?<br/>
<br/>
The electronics shop visit gives us points with Mishima (literally useless) and <span class="bbc-spoiler">Chihaya</span>, who we don’t need points with. As such, this decision makes itself.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="179-133.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh sweet heavens, hitting “Decline” has never felt so good.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="180-Chat.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> You’re not interested in electronics? Or did you have something else to do?<br/>
<br/>
I just like disappointing Mishima, cat. And after the day I’ve had, I deserve to do something I like.
