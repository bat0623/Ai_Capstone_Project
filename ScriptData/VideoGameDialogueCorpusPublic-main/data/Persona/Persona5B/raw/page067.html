Well, thanks to some bullshit in regards to an inaccurate and archaic cap on character limits, I had to cleave this post in twain. Whatever.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Boy_10.jpg"/> Did you catch the news report this morning about the mafia boss getting busted? Apparently, someone scattered calling cards all across Shibuya just before his arrest. Remember the Kamoshida scandal? They say the same thing happened, that someone left a calling card. Madarame too, if I’m not mistaken.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Boy_12.jpg"/> Do you think it’s the Phantom Thieves? If so, I’m impressed. I can’t believe they actually steal hearts!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Sae.png"/> ...Depending on the means, yes. He’s absolutely right.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Usami.png"/> It seems like some of our students had been victimized by them, so we can breathe easy for now. I’m thankful to the police for arresting the perp, even though they’re just doing their job. By the way, “perp” is police slang. You might have heard the stars in police procedurals say it. It’s short for “perpetrator.”<br/>
<br/>
The sec with the mo’s got a perf al.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Usami.png"/> Speaking of stars… Can you answer this question, Hamiru-san?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
No, no. Fuck off. I’m not letting you get away with that bullshit segue. Try harder.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Usami.png"/> That’s correct.<br/>

<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Knowledge +1</b>.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Usami.png"/> By the way, there are rumors that the Phantom Thieves took down the perp this time—Kaneshiro. I remember their name with that bit on Madarame, as well as the incident in May. Is this a new urban legend? Anyway, please prepare for your tests starting Wednesday, and don’t be distracted by rumors like that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Morgana.png"/> Looks like we succeeded in changing Kaneshiro’s heart! A lot of people are talking about the Phantom Thieves too!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-RyujiSummer.png"/> Hell yeah! Kaneshiro finally confessed! People’ve been makin’ a huge deal of it since the police announcement!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-YusukeBlue.png"/> It’s difficult to accept that the authorities are taking all of the credit for his arrest.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-RyujiSummer.png"/> It’s all comin’ together for us!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-YusukeBlue.png"/> This is quite the turnaround. All of a sudden, people are expressing their long-standing belief in us.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-AnnSummer.png"/> So this is why Makoto told us to post the calling card anywhere that might stand out.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-RyujiSummer.png"/> Pretty smart move on her part. Oh… where is our amazing Miss President?<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummer.png"/> I’ve been called into a meeting with the principal. There’s no need to worry though. More importantly, there is a special on TV about the Phantom Thieves!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-AnnSummer.png"/> Huh? What did it say!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummer.png"/> They were talking all about our calling cards.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-AnnSummer.png"/> For real!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummer.png"/> Anyway, my apologies about today. I’ll have to see you all another time.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-RyujiSummer.png"/> Really!? That’s freakin’ crazy!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-YusukeBlue.png"/> I hope all this excitement doesn’t place us on the police’s radar.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-RyujiSummer.png"/> It’ll be fine! No way they’d fine out about that weird other world!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-YusukeBlue.png"/> True, but… Do you remember what the fake Kaneshiro said towards the end?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-AnnSummer.png"/> Yeah, he said we’re not the only ones who are doing it…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-RyujiSummer.png"/> Eh, not gonna let it bother me. Far as we know, he was just pullin’ that shit out of his ass.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-YusukeBlue.png"/> I hope that’s the case...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-RyujiSummer.png"/> Anyways, in your face, Akechi! Now whaddya wanna do about our next target!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-AnnSummer.png"/> Don’t get ahead of yourself. Still, people might expect a lot from our next move considering how excited they’re getting.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-RyujiSummer.png"/> We can’t just pick any old schmo now.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-YusukeBlue.png"/> There is no need to hurry though. Counting Kamoshida, we’ve claimed three consecutive victories, right? We should just lay low and wait for all this excitement to blow over.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-AnnSummer.png"/> In that case, how about we have another celebration?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-RyujiSummer.png"/> Good idea! We can make it a welcomin’ party for Miss President too. By the way, that briefcase? It’s pretty damn expensive! Let’s sell it and drop the cash on our party.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, Ryuji. I already sold it to finance my health drink habit.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Morgana.png"/> Wow… Seems like the “lay low and wait” idea has gone completely out the window.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-AnnSummer.png"/> So we can count you out then, Morgana?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-AnnSummer.png"/> Hahaha, that’s the spirit. Well, I’m gonna let Makoto know!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-AnnSummer.png"/> Oh…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-YusukeBlue.png"/> What’s wrong?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-022.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummer.png"/> If you wish not to stand out, you had best not get bad grades, OK? That is something I simply would not be able to overlook as student council president! For now, behave and concentrate on your studies. We can have fun once finals are over… Understood?<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummer.png"/> No, I’m nowhere close. However, after considering all the facts, I concluded there are no errors in their acts or principles. Thus, upon deeming them to be on the side of justice, I have decided to end my investigation.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Principal.png"/> But that’s impossible! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummer.png"/> Impossible…? May I see the evidence you have that leads you to believe so?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Principal.png"/> I was just speaking to the director of a prestigious college about your letter of recommendation too...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummer.png"/> There will be no need for that. I intend on getting into a good college by my own merit. Please excuse me.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Principal.png"/> About that… Yes, I am making progress. However, I have stumbled upon some difficulties… Still, why would someone as important as you be interested in a petty case like this…? N-No! That’s not what I meant…! I will investigate with all the resources available to me. Of course… Um, I should be able to let you know relatively soon. Yes, I will bring good news… Well then, thank you for your--<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummer.png"/> Yes, of course. Though… what is the point of studying?<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Sae.png"/> What else is there besides success? Don’t ask me such childish questions.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Sae.png"/> Even the police couldn’t figure out why. It really… was out of nowhere. This would only make sense if his personality changed… but that would be impossible.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummer.png"/> Why does it matter? The police still caught him in the end, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Sae.png"/> I had plans set for a promotion, but no one can take credit for his arrest now with that confession. ...Not that a child would understand.<br/>

Judgement is a card that represents making a decision, rebirth, and absolution, and when reversed, self-doubt. It’s about the moment of reflection at the end of a journey.<br/>
<br/>
In Personas 3 and 4, Fool and Judgement were linked arcana that represented the bonds between your teammates as the game progressed. When Fool ended, Judgement would step in and take its place. This was because Fool is the first card, 0, and Judgement was the twenty-first and “last” (not counting The World, which is another special arcana that doesn’t get a corresponding Social Link/Confidant in any of the games, or Aeon, which is just Judgement from the Thoth deck stapled onto the end of the deck to make an excuse for another Social Link in the rereleases of 3 and 4). Persona 5, obviously, does not do that, with Fool going to Igor and Judgement going to Sae.<br/>
<br/>
But, yep, we’ve got a Confidant with Sae. There sadly isn’t a flash-forward for this one, heh. Also, you may have noticed that we didn’t get an ability from this level. As you may have guessed, Sae’s Confidant, being Judgment, is a little special. <s>We still get the Arcana Burst experience when we fuse Judgement Personas, though… which is hilariously confusing. You know how The Flash time-travels into Batman’s dream in Batman v Superman? Well, first, you shouldn’t, that movie’s terrible. But anyway, it’s kinda like that but slightly less nonsensical.</s> We do not, in fact, get Arcana Burst experience yet, which is honestly pretty annoying.<br/>

Well then, we’ll clean this up quickly and put it behind us. Yes. A grand undertaking like social reform is beyond a group such as the Phantom Thieves.

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-TV.jpg"/> So in a way, they’re outlaws.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="138-RyujiYellow.png"/> Y-Yes, ma’am...<br/>

You know a girl named Yumeko Mogami? She’s always up near the classrooms on the second floor… Please, you have to do something before things get worse!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Morgana.png"/> Heheh! This is a good opportunity for us! Kaneshiro’s change of heart has probably opened up some deeper parts of Mementos. Let’s make some time and talk about it at the hideout.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chatter.jpg"/> Maybe someone’s asking them to do it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chatter.jpg"/> Oh yeah, don’t they have a forum or something?<br/>
