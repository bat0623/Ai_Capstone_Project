<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Whisper.jpg"/> The Phantom Thieves will do something about it!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Whisper.jpg"/> Can they really? We don’t even know who they are.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Whisper.jpg"/> It’s probably impossible. We’d need some sort of miracle… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Whisper.jpg"/> If they could do something about it, they’d be gods!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Office_Worker_2.jpg"/> I got home late last night, and my wife yelled at me since I didn’t tell her where I was… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Office_Worker_3.jpg"/> Ahaha! You do something naughty behind her back? Careful, or the Phantom Thieves might target you!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Office_Worker_2.jpg"/> No, you moron. I was just drinking with co-workers. Must you always bring up the Phantom Thieves?<br/>
<br/>
First thing we’re gonna do before we leave is save the game, so we can reload. Why? Because, of course, I want to see all the incidental dialogue, and I got paranoid about running out of time before it updates. We’re going to be spending our time today indoors, and we can’t reenter Leblanc once we leave for the day without spending time (unless it’s just to go to the hideout) (unless it’s night).<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Boom_Box.jpg"/> Be careful so you don’t get heat stroke! Today’s topic is “Ways to Beat the Heat.”<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Old_Man_3.jpg"/> I swear this heat’s taken years off my life. And it doesn’t help that the seasons are all screwy.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Old_Woman.jpg"/> I’m sure it’ll be fine. The Phantom Thieves will do something about it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Old_Man_2.jpg"/> You really think we can rely on them? They have no obligation to save Japan.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Old_Woman.jpg"/> That may be true… But would they really abandon someone in need?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Mother.jpg"/> It’s hot outside, so don’t push him too hard. He’s an old dog, after all.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Missile.png"/> ...Woof! Woof!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Dog-loving_Girl.jpg"/> Kotaro says he’s fine! We’re gonna help the Phantom Thieves!<br/>
<br/>
This dog is gonna die by the end of the game and it’ll be super depressing.<br/>

<br/>
We’re pretty hosed. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Reporter.jpg"/> So you think Medjed have a valid point? That the major corporations are making too much and therefore should suffer from this?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Young_Cameraman.jpg"/> ...Are you sure you want to say that? The sponsors will complain if they hear those comments…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Reporter.jpg"/> Don’t worry. This’ll just make things more exciting. Be sure to edit them so they flow together!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-BDL.jpg"/> However, I, the Sun God, will surely save them along with my apostles, the Phantom Thieves! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Protestor.jpg"/> Sun God! Please order the Phantom Thieves to punish Medjed immediately!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-BDL.jpg"/> N-No need to be hasty! I am waiting for the right opportunity, you fledgling! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Woman_6.jpg"/> That isn’t like you. Is it because of that thing going on between the Phantom Thieves and Medjed? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Woman_7.jpg"/> Yes! And I want something to happen! And then, Akechi-kun will be on TV to comment on it! He looks so good when he’s just talking! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Office_Worker_3.jpg"/> Yeah? Well, if I’m here, that means you couldn’t handle it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Office_Worker.jpg"/> But… I was made project lead…<br/>
<br/>
This is one of the requests we have currently. Unfortunately, we need to put in a bit of legwork to get the target’s name. We’ll get there soon.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Man_5.jpg"/> I’ve already gotten… 100 numbers this summer. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Man_7.jpg"/> Are you serious!? How many people is that per day? That’s insane! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Man_5.jpg"/> Perhaps you could say I’m a Phantom Thief of Hearts…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Woman_9.jpg"/> There’s certainly nothing we can do. It’d be awful if Medjed set their sights on our company. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Woman_8.jpg"/> Exactly. Higher-ups like my hubby are who need to step in if things go south. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Woman_9.jpg"/> Sometimes, I’m relieved my husband hasn’t climbed so high in the ranks. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-014.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Homeless_Man.jpg"/> No, I’m OK. I still seem to be… myself. The Phantom Thieves steal hearts, huh? To be honest, I wish they’d take the heart of… you know. I guess I’ll try to persuade him by writing another letter. It’s better than doing nothing… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Woman_7.jpg"/> Aw, that’s so nice! Actually, I’ve always wanted to be an actress… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Fishy_Hawker.jpg"/> Yeah! I can tell acting is in your soul. I know you’ll become famous if you take our acting courses! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Woman_7.jpg"/> Hm, it seems a little expensive. I don’t have much money, so I’ll have to ask my parents…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Fishy_Hawker.jpg"/> No problem at all! I can get you a job where you can make lots of money in just a little time!<br/>
<br/>
Tell me more, Fishy Hawker! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Promoter.jpg"/> Have you reevaluated your home security lately? If not, now is the perfect time! We’re having a special promo sale of our total security systems. Join now for bonus benefits! Don’t let this opportunity pass you by! When danger strikes, will you have the protection you need? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Winger.jpg"/> Yeah, it’s all over if they can destroy the infrastructure. Those hackers in Medjed know this. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Lawyer.jpg"/> If the economy takes a hit too, the current government won’t last either. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Winger.jpg"/> The Phantom Thieves might be our last hope. Maybe we really did take peace for granted, you know? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Now, we reload and craft… more Lockpicks! Woo! The double craft procs without my having to savescum this time, leaving us with 6 more, for a total of twenty. We will not be using all of these by the end of the game. <br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Proficiency +3</b>, including a bonus +1 from the double craft.<br/>
<br/>

And we rank up in Proficiency! Hooray, now we can open that goddamn door for Yusuke! <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-AnnChat.png"/> People are getting even more restless online too.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-RyujiChat.png"/> Are we done for if we lose here…?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Remember how we were going to try to formulate a backup plan? That sure went nowhere, ha.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-RyujiChat.png"/> Maaku’s right. Sorry for messaging you all about such weird stuff.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-AnnChat.png"/> It’s OK. We all feel the same way.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-RyujiChat.png"/> I’ll try and make sure I don’t blow my cover.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-MakotoChat.jpg"/> As should we all.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Morgana.png"/> It sounds like everyone’s starting to get anxious. But considering how fast the days are closing in, the best thing we can do for now is stay calm. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-TV.jpg"/> It’s only days until August 21st, the day Medjed will attack, and corporations are scrambling. With no sign of a response from the Phantom Thieves, some suspect they’ve surrendered or ran away. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Morgana.png"/> Huh? We did not run away! And we’ll never surrender! Just watch and see what happens! <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Office_Worker_4.jpg"/> You should be ready for any new crisis. That’s why I installed all this new security software. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Office_Worker.jpg"/> Well, I don’t have any info that’d be valuable to them. They’ll only go after the big companies. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-TV.jpg"/> With Medjed’s day of attack almost here, the anticipation over their showdown is at a fever pitch. People overseas are also showing great interest. Some are even betting on who will win. One bookie says that the odds are on Medjed’s side. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Morgana.png"/> People are really betting on this? And they think we’re gonna lose? <br/>

<br/>
NO.<br/>

First thing we do is head on down to ol’ Book Town and buy the first book.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Taxi_Driver_1.jpg"/> Companies seem to be on high alert. A lot of my customers have complained about how much more work they have.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-Bickle.jpg"/> Listening to people’s complaints is part of the job. And lemme tell you, everyone’s real stressed out. Still, I dunno if anyone should blindly trust a group that calls themselves the “Phantom Thieves.”<br/>
<br/>
They don’t. They’re #Millennials.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-YusukeCollarless.png"/> However, the door appears to be jammed. What shall we do, Maaku? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Protag.png"/> <i>I think I’ll be able to open the door with my current <b>Proficiency</b>…</i> <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-YusukeCollarless.png"/> Maaku, you are capable of fixing it? ...You never cease to amaze me.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-YusukeCollarless.png"/> You know, I lived here not long ago, yet it feels almost like the distant past at this point… Being here has brought back memories though. Whenever I acted out of line, I was made to sit calmly in this corner. Ah, and over here was a bookshelf, filled to the brim with various tomes. It contained art compilation books for the most part, but there were a few manga tucked away as well… At times I would take a break from my art to hide and read them… This is also where we would gather to eat when the atelier still had a large pupil count. Sensei is particularly fond of salty food, so… <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-YusukeCollarless.png"/> Why do I still treat him as my mentor? How long will I allow him to control my life…? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-YusukeCollarless.png"/> Y-Yes… My apologies. The truth of the matter is, I used to paint in this room… and I did it simply for the joy of painting. No matter what I took as my subject, my hands would move of their own accord to capture its essence… But back then, I only saw the superficial beauty of the world. I could not see the grime beneath. After learning the truth behind Madarame’s actions though, everything changed. I strove to fight back against the newfound ugliness I saw… To display my talent to those who mocked me… I needed to do whatever it took to validate my artistic ability… In that search for meaning, darkness took hold of me. ...Ultimately, I began to emulate that which I had so deeply despised in Madarame. You know, Boss told me something very interesting when I was staying with you that one night at Leblanc… He said… he didn’t believe Madarame took me in for my skill alone. I suppose now that I think about it, there would be no way to know whether or not I would have been talented. ...Maaku, why do you think Madarame decided to take me in?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he was impressed by your inability to stop talking, wow.<br/>

This is about the moment I realize that for the first time in the entire game I’ve forgotten to bring a matching Persona. Oh well! It’s not worth reloading, there’s ways around it. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-YusukeCollarless.png"/> It truly is a mysterious beast… …… Even after learning the ugliness of his true nature, a part of me still believes in my former mentor. I simiply cannot come to terms with the stark dualities presented to me… The humble house and that loathsome Palace… The kind teachers and the fiendishly deceptive artist… It seems even the workings of my own heart are inexplicable… What, then of my search for pure beauty…?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-Question_Mark.png"/> Is someone there? I’m coming in. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-YusukeCollarless.png"/> Hm? Could that be the police!? <br/>
<br/>
Ah shit man, I can’t get caught with the goods on me<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Who the hell are you? <br/>

<br/>
Oh, that dude? Why is he trespassing on our trespassing? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Art_Patron.jpg"/> Indeed. Thank you for our conversation back there. More importantly though, why are you here? I couldn’t help but notice the door was open on my way home from work. <br/>
<br/>
So you… went inside? What?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Art_Patron.jpg"/> I know a great deal about you, Yusuke-kun. You’ve made a name for yourself by patterning your work after the beautifully detailed “Sayuri”… But that painting at the exhibition was… quite different from that. Have you begun trying out new styles? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-YusukeCollarless.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Art_Patron.jpg"/> If you’d like, I can advise you. Materials, themes, et cetera. You seem as though you could use a helping hand right now. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-YusukeCollarless.png"/> I… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Art_Patron.jpg"/> Most of your painting was done while living in this residence, correct? Your current lack of patron must be what is holding you back. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Art_Patron.jpg"/> I’ve made a living investing in promising young artists like yourself, Yusuke-kun.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-067.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-YusukeCollarless.png"/> But… why have you chosen me? You criticized me so harshly back at the exhibition. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Art_Patron.jpg"/> Because I feel you have talent. Now, my foundations can provide you an environment that will allow you to focus on developing your skills. If such a lifestyle interests you, we can talk further at a later date. As for today, I have business I must attend to… but I hope to hear from you soon. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-YusukeCollarless.png"/> My opportunity may have finally arrived… And it was all because you opened that door for me… Hm, it seems good luck is simply a characteristic of yours. You have my thanks, leader. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Protag.png"/> <i>I feel like my bond with Yusuke is growing deeper…</i> <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-YusukeCollarless.png"/> ...I must be going now. I’d like to think on this some more. Farewell.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="113-Goro.png"/> Medjed is extremely dangerous. Judging from their past actions, they’ll make good on their threat. Of course, Medjed has only resurfaced because the Phantom Thieves recklessly provoked them. If the Phantom Thieves have any shred of decency, they should step forward and take responsibility. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Morgana.png"/> He says it’s our fault? Can you believe how we got dragged into this? <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I discover Shinjuku has a fucking acupuncture clinic, what? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Morgana.png"/> This is an acupuncture clinic? Hm, so people get treatments with needles here for their health… I bet the drained and exhausted people in Shinjuku come here, seeking immediate relief… <br/>
<br/>
Sadly, we cannot go inside. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> I don’t really mind it, but keep yourself in check, OK?<br/>
<br/>
Let’s look into working here to fulfill that request. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="117-075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> Or is it that you’re interested in working here at night? A lot of different people visit this bar, so maybe working here could broaden your perspective. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="118-076.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> You may not realize it, but you’ve got potential, young man. I can teach you the basics of how things are run here. Don’t worry, you won’t do anything illegal. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-077.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-078.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Working at the bar is a returning feature from Persona 4 Golden, and functions almost identically. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> So, did you want to do some work for me today?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> All right, go on and change. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Ohya.png"/> Well, aren’t you a hard worker? Well, I guess it’s about time for me to be heading out. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="123-081.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> It’s your first time, so things might be a little scary, but just try to relax. It’s easy work. I’ll need you to help with some chores around the bar. Washing dishes, cleaning tables, the like. I have to entertain the customers, so I can’t do those things myself. That’s why you’re here now! And there you have it. Explanation finito. Do you have any questions? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="124-082.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> You’re underage, right? So please don’t touch any of the alcohol. No drinking it, of course, but that also means no serving it either. I’ll do that, don’t worry. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="125-083.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> Let’s see… There’s just one of me, so sometimes I can’t pay attention to all my customers. Would you be on the lookout for those times? I’m sure they’ll want to talk to you, too. They’re all great people, so don’t worry. I’m sure it’ll be a good experience for you. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="126-084.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
*sigh* Fine, I’ll ask it. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> Ah… Are you interested? I can be your producer if that’s the case. ...Haha, just kidding. I don’t want to break any adult entertainment laws, you know? What you’re wearing now is fine. Well, I guess I’ll have you start immediately, then. It’s almost time for the customers to arrive, so good luck. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="127-085.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Morgana.png"/> I would have loved to see you all dolled up. Hey, there’s a customer who’s all alone. You should go check up on them. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Protag.png"/> <i>Which customer should I talk to…?</i> <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="128-086.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Based on what customers are present, we can gain a corresponding social stat by spending the evening talking to them.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="129-087.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Office_Worker.jpg"/> This might bore you, but I wanted to ask. What do you think of our nation’s economy? They used tax money as an emergency measure to restore the economy… But it only increased our nation’s debt, which in turn burdens us, the citizens… Is this really a good strategy for revitalizing the economy…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Morgana.png"/> Ugh, this is going to take some time… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="130-capture_093_15012018_164113.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Morgana.png"/> I’m surprised anyone could be so long-winded. But you did talk about a pretty difficult topic. I’m sure you gained some <b>Knowledge</b> out of it. <br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Knowledge +2</b>. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="131-088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> Oh, right, you were speaking with Nagai-san, right? He’s an elite banker. He talks a lot, but he’s got a wealth of knowledge. I bet you learned a lot by talking to him. Well, here’s your pay. Keep up the good work!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="132-089.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Pay’s good, but we can get guaranteed social stats from other repeatable opportunities, and in higher quantities.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> All right, you should be going home. You’re still underage, and Shinjuku is dangerous at night.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="133-090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Morgana.png"/> We should go home. I’m getting sleepy...
