<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Girl_5.jpg"/> Yeah, it’s a new fall fragrance. It’s supposed to be mysterious, like the Phantom Thieves. I thought I’d wear it to show my support while they’re out there taking down an evil corporation. <br/>
<br/>
Girl #2 here is explicitly described here as “Phangirl,” for the record. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Girl_4.jpg"/> A show of support, huh? I could post a photo online of all the Phan merch I’ve amassed. Maybe they’ll be motivated by how passionate their fans are. <br/>
<br/>
I’m sure they will. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Rocker.jpg"/> Don’t know what you’re talking about, old man. I’m all about rock n’ roll—nothing else! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Old_Man_4.jpg"/> I saw some pretty hilarious videos of you online, but maybe I got the wrong guy? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Rocker.jpg"/> I express myself best through music. My next song is a ballad praising the Phantom Thieves… I give you… “Phantom Thieves Jongara Bushi”! Haaa, appeeearing iiin Tooohhh-kyooohhh…<br/>
<br/>
It’s occuring to me that this dude’s musical genre gimmick doesn’t really work in pure text form even in the original game, and double doesn’t work in LP form. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Woman_6.jpg"/> Well, you also lied to him about your age. Are you sure you have the right to complain? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Woman_7.jpg"/> That’s different. Anyway, I asked the Phantom Thieves to give him a change of heart. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Woman_6.jpg"/> Geez… I think maybe it’s you who might need a change of heart. <br/>
<br/>

These CHATTER messages are getting intense. <br/>

All right, I guess we should <i>finally</i> get to telling Takemi about her patient. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Tae.png"/> There’s nothing to talk about… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Morgana.png"/> Why don’t you tell Takemi about Oyamada? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Tae.png"/> Oh fine… I’ll go to you, so wait there. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Tae.png"/> Yes? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Girl_s_Father.jpg"/> I wanted to speak with you right away! The hospital that was on the news is the same one you used to work at, right!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Tae.png"/> The hospital on the news? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Old_Woman.jpg"/> But I knew you weren’t capable of doing those terrible things. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Tae.png"/> ...Wh-What’s going on? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Old_Woman.jpg"/> Oh, my. You really don’t know, do you? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Girl_s_Father.jpg"/> Chief of Staff Oyamada turned himself in. He was manipulating things behind the scenes. Turns out he was the one who made that terrible medical error, and laid the blame on his subordinate! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Tae.png"/> Is that… true?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Girl_s_Father.jpg"/> It’s been on news channels all over the country! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Tae.png"/> I haven’t… seen it… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Girl_s_Father.jpg"/> I just knew something didn’t quite add up about that story. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Old_Woman.jpg"/> I never believed someone like you could have ever done something like that. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Sick_Girl.jpg"/> Hooray! Doctor! But… What’s a medical error? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Tae.png"/> What? Um… It’s something that shouldn’t be allowed to happen… I guess. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Tae.png"/> Oyamada surrendering himself… at such a convenient time… Why…? ...It doesn’t matter. It’s too late. It doesn’t change the fact that I couldn’t save her… <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Girl_s_Father.jpg"/> Oh, it must’ve been difficult for her too. I heard she’s been moved to another hospital… <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Sad to break the “It’s for my exams” chain, but it’s worth it not to ruin this moment. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Tae.png"/> Once the medicine is perfected, I’ll introduce you to Miwa-chan and tell her how much you helped. All right, into the examination room you go. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Madarame was in a similar state after we changed his heart.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-MakotoChat.jpg"/> It’ll be OK, don’t worry. All we have to do is wait. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-HaruChat.jpg"/> ...You’re right. I’ll just believe it’s going to work. Thank you, and sorry for asking so many times. I’ll message you again if there is more progress. <br/>
<br/>
Just relax, Haru. I’m 1000% positive this’ll go off without a hitch. Why, I’d stake the Phantom Thieves’ reputation on it!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Morgana.png"/> I get why Haru is worried… but let’s just wait for the change of heart to go through. Don’t worry, it’ll be just like it always is.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Haughty.png"/> Haha, there’s no need to hide it. There’s no shame in projecting your suppressed hopes onto them. It’s clear that they have power. They have an ethical obligation to use it wisely. The pressure and expectations that burden exceptional people… I know it well, hahaha. <br/>

<br/>
Well, let me tell you about this great little startup called Uber—now, you have to supply your own car, and pay for gas, and you won’t make anything near a living wage, but hey, at least the company’s so awful in so many different ways they’re losing money too!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Office_Worker_2.jpg"/> Yeah, well—don’t get me started on my bosses. These days they’re little more than slave-drivers… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Bickle.jpg"/> Maybe we need to ask the Phantom Thieves for help. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Office_Worker_2.jpg"/> I hope they take down my boss when they’re done with Okumura. <br/>

Oh, hey Mishima. Guess we should hang, or whatever. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MishimaSummer.png"/> Oh, so I’ve been researching that actor, and I came across some substantial new info. <br/>
<br/>
Oh. Perfect.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MishimaSummer.png"/> Are you free to hear what I found?<br/>
<br/>
...Sure, buddy. Sure. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-042.jpg"/><br/>

Oh, awesome, what fresh hell will prevent us from reaching the next rank here? Getting sick of your shit, Mishima. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MishimaSummer.png"/> He probably just couldn’t live with himself after what he did to her… His reputation did a total 180 after he announced the marriage though. People used to hate him, but now all everyone wants to talk about is how sweet and manly he is. At any rate, we can’t oppose the will of the public. Good thing we decided not to change his heart.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it <i>is</i> good we <i>all</i> decided that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MishimaSummer.png"/> Support for the Phantom Thieves would’ve really dropped if we had. ...I need to make sure our next target is one we can win against.<br/>

If we really wanna make you guys famous, we need to do more than just answer promising requests. Right now there are tons of idiots out there doubting you, and trying to influence others to do the same. So… we’re gonna purge them.<br/>

<br/>
How about not phrasing it at all because we’re not doing that, you imbecile?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MishimaSummer.png"/> The truth is, I looked up some of these idiots who were criticizing you and sent them warning messages. You know, something like, “If you don’t change your wicked ways, you’ll be our next target.”<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MishimaSummer.png"/> I dunno, you just seem… quiet. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Akiyama.jpg"/> ...Shut your mouth, zero. I don’t got time to be listening to you. <br/>
<br/>
Akiyama leaves.<br/>

<br/>
Sure thing.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MishimaSummer.png"/> I even heard he’s been hanging out with some shady people… They’re all scum. I wish we could change their hearts, for the good of our society...<br/>

Oh dear. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I should find this hilarious, but today I take no joy in this. Mishima, you gotta calm the fuck down. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-MishimaSummer.png"/> …… H-Hahaha… Good joke, Hamiru. …… Anyway, I’m heading home. I’ll send you Akiyama-kun’s info later… <br/>

<br/>
Yeah, we really shou--<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Wait, right now!?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-AnnSummer.png"/> Didn’t he give us some other weird request too? Something about that handsome actor? Is Mishima-kun trying to take advantage of us…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-YusukeBlue.png"/> Apparently he has also threatened anyone who dares speak ill of the Phantom Thieves on his forum. Perhaps we should enact a change of heart on Mishima, not this Akiyama fellow. <br/>
<br/>
We’re really considering this? Holy shit, wow.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-RyujiSummer.png"/> Whoa, wait up. He ain’t that bad. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Morgana.png"/> Hm… I guess we could find out what’s happening if we managed to find his Shadow. I mean, he’s already worried that we’re gonna change his heart, right? We’ll probably be able to track down his Shadow in Mementos. All things considered, I think our best course of action would be to defeat it and change his heart. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-HaruSummer.png"/> Mishima-kun…? It feels almost wrong to consider such an option…<br/>
<br/>
Haru, have you even met Mishima? You’ve been a Phantom Thief for less than two weeks. I’m not saying you’re wrong to be skeptical here, but don’t act like you have some great personal objection.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-FutabaTankTop.png"/> We can’t have him keep causing problems for us though. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-MakotoSummer.png"/> Either way, we can decide whether or not we change his heart later. For now, we must meet his Shadow. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Morgana.png"/> Yeah. Let’s head into Mementos and track down Mishima’s Shadow!<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="125-Chouno.png"/> It seems so many of us have experienced this that a term has been created for it. The English name for that particular phenomenon can be abbreviated to “PVS”… Would anyone like to tell me what that stands for? Mr. Hamiru! Let’s hear it. What is this phenomenon commonly called in English? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Morgana.png"/> OK, let’s try to puzzle out this acronym! So “PVS,” referring to when you mistakenly think your phone is going off… What’s the P?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="126-089.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Morgana.png"/> Right. It’s gotta start with “phantom,” since you’re only imagining it. So next is the V part. That means it’d be “phantom...” what? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="127-090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Morgana.png"/> That’s it! When your phone buzzes, you say it’s “vibrating.” Last is the S. So if we have “phantom vibration” so far… <br/>
<br/>
Chouno's all, "You’re taking a really long time, dude. Stop muttering to your meowing desk and answer the question."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="128-091.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="125-Chouno.png"/> Good! The correct English term is “phantom vibration syndrome.” If you’re anxiously waiting for someone to contact you, your brain will apparently trick you. This is an affliction that can only affect a modern society, where being connected 24/7 is commonplace. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-FutabaTankTop.png"/> But that’s kinda… wrong. There was one promise I lied about doing… One promise I never actually finished. It was “get along with Kana-chan.” This all started back when I was in elementary school.<br/>
<br/>
Oh boy, bracing for a long story…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-FutabaTankTop.png"/> I used to get bullied pretty hard for how weird I was… The other kids always accused me of cheating because I’d get perfect scores on my tests. Then one time I turned in a test with nothing written down instead… but the school ended up yelling at my mom. My life at school was horrible. Sometimes during recess, I’d lock myself in the bathroom and cry… I didn’t have a single friend… I was always alone. But then a girl named Kana transferred to my school… She was absent a lot at first, then when she was there, the other kids bullied her… like they did to me. But one day, she said something to me: “Good morning.” She started saying it every day from then on. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="136-099.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="137-100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-FutabaTankTop.png"/> To be honest… I completely ignored her the first few times. I thought the bullies had put her up to it. But without fail, she’d come over to me to say good morning… Then eventually, I decided to say it back. It felt like my heart was gonna shatter into a million pieces… But apparently, she’d been saying it to me that whole time because she thought we could be friends. She was the first person who didn’t mind how weird I was… I was so happy about making a friend that I told my mom. That’s when she added something to my promise list. “Get along with Kana-chan.” B-But… I couldn’t do it. One particularly windy morning, Kana-chan dropped her diary and the pages flew everywhere. I didn’t really mean to look… but I ended up seeing everything she had written down. And… once I see something, I can’t forget it… It was all so horrible… She wrote about how her parents hit her, how they made her take pictures in weird clothes… Kana-chan’s diary was full of stories like that… Then when I asked her about it… she got really defensive. I felt terrible, but she just kept yelling at me for reading it… <br/>
<br/>
...Oh. Oh dear.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="138-101.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
“Sounds like it was her fault.” Jesus christ!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="139-102.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-FutabaTankTop.png"/> I just… froze up… And then… I ran. I ran… and ran… I wanted her to stop yelling. I wanted to go back to how things were before… ...Kana-chan ended up moving away pretty soon after that. I haven’t talked to her since. So… I lied to my mom. Even after Kana-chan left, I would tell her we were best friends. Every month, she’d write that promise on my list… and every month, I’d lie about it. <br/>
