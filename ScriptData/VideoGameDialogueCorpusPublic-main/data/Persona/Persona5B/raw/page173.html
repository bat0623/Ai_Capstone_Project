	<b>Part 166: 12/7: The Meek Shall Inherit The Earth</b><br/><br/>
It seems some of you were rather dismayed at Skull’s plan last update, particularly the whole bit about using Oracle as pedobait. Well, uh, good! More support for Shido!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-AnnPanther.png"/> Let’s see… One of them is apparently at the slots, and the other doesn’t leave his room? Well, the map says there’s an entertainment hall up ahead. Maybe the slots are there?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-YusukeFox.png"/> Seeing for ourselves will likely be the quickest way to find out. Let us proceed onward. <br/>
<br/>
And so, the Phantom Thieves leave the pool deck.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Running down more hallways~<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Map.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Here’s another map. I don’t know why I’m even bothering to show these, there’s no way to make sense of them.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-MakotoMouse.jpg"/> I guess that means there’s a Shido statue here too. How troublesome.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-YusukeMouse.jpg"/> Hm… My ad-mice would be to pro-squeak cautiously.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-FutabaOracle.png"/> ……<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-YusukeMouse.jpg"/> Oracle, my ad-mice would be--<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-HaruMouse.jpg"/> I believe she heard you the first time. Anyway, can we focus on the task at hand? <br/>
<br/>
Further in, we are treated to another mousecapade and some bad puns.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The twist here is that the statues are no longer confined to rooms, but are now in hallways as well. It’s not a major change. Here, the thieves have to carefully navigate a series of hallways with Shadows emerging from them.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This is Barong. It’s weak to Curse and Wind and blocks Bless. It uses Electricity and can inflict Rage. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This is Kurama Tengu. It’s weak to Ice, reflects Wind, and uses Wind and Physical, as well as Masukunda.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Panther learns Diarahan to replace Diarama.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oracle’s Subrecover HP EX automatically replaces Subrecover HP, upgrading it from 10% to 20%.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And here’s just the fucking exit because we have a lot of update left and the layout really isn’t that interesting.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-YusukeFox.png"/> Hm!? Look. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-RyujiSkull.png"/> What the…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-FutabaOracle.png"/> That seems to be a Shadow too. Be careful, guys. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-RyujiSkull.png"/> He looks way tougher than the other ones… You think they’re tightenin’ security?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-MorganaAngry.png"/> It wouldn’t be surprising. We’ve taken down two targets, after all. Let’s proceed forward cautiously. <br/>
<br/>
So, a new, stronger variant of Shadow. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
These guys won’t hesitate to just fucking <i>shoot</i> the Phantom Thieves, though the bullets don’t seem to do anything. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That bird in the middle is Garuda. It’s weak to Gun, repels Bless, and uses Amped Wind and Masukukaja.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Skull learns Matarukaja to replace Tarukaja, an amazing skill that will make him a mainstay for boss fights. Not that the Phantom Thieves will be fighting any bosses, once Shido has them murdered! ...Oh, I’m bad at this!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Safe room time!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This is Forneus. It’s weak to Electricity, drains Ice and Blocks Psy, and uses Psy and ailments like Brainwash and Confuse.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-ShidoWoman_3.jpg"/> But I suppose if he’s on this ship, Mr. Shido must accept him… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-021.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-022.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-023.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-FutabaOracle.png"/> He looks super dangerous! I don’t wanna get involved, even if he’s just some old cognitive thing!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Cleaner.jpg"/> What’re you punks mumblin’ on about? I hear you’ve been makin’ quite a mess in here.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-MorganaShocked.png"/> Eep… W-We’re totally not making a mess, we swear! Who are you anyway!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Cleaner.jpg"/> Hmph! I’m the one askin’ questions around here. Now, drink some salt water and reflect on what you did. I’m leavin’ this to you, guys. I don’t got the time to waste on little punks like these. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-RyujiSkull.png"/> Salt water!? Does that mean… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-FutabaOracle.png"/> Look out, here they come! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
These guys are weak to Bless and don’t have a ton of health, so they go down quick. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Fox learns High Counter to replace Counterstrike, upgrading his Physical repel rate from 15% to 20%.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-RyujiSkull.png"/> That wasn’t funny, dammit! They were totally tryin’ to kill us! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-HaruNoir.png"/> Maybe because we caused a scene at both the restaurant and the pool. Somebody has to clean up the mess. Wait a second… “Clean up the mess?” <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-FutabaOracle.png"/> Ohhh, that’s why they call him the “cleaner”! It’s ‘cause he mops up any trouble that shows its face.<br/>
<br/>
That’s right, the cleaner is not actually Akechi, weirdly enough. It’s just some random dude. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-FutabaOracle.png"/> That should make him pretty easy to find though. We just gotta disturb the peace somehow. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-MakotoQueen.png"/> But doing so would have an adverse effect on us finding the other letters of introduction. Let’s leave him for last and hurry over to the other two first. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-YusukeFox.png"/> In that case, our next target should be the TV station president in the entertainment hall ahead. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-FutabaOracle.png"/> Let’s go, Joker. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
First, though, Joker makes a quick stop to fuse. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Barong and Titania make Melchizedek, which incurs a 48960 yen penalty as it is above Joker’s level. At this point, I have made a decision to not fuse anything more than five levels above me so as to not completely destroy the game’s difficulty curve. Though Shido will surely make quick work of these thieves no matter what, hahaha!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Melchizedek.jpg"/> Given that I’m now your new mask, I will protect your justice with the whole of my being.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Melchizedek is a Biblical figure known for wisdom, and sources like the Book of Genesis mention him as both a king and a priest. His in-game description is: “An angel of Gnosticism, governing over peace and righteousness. Though said to be the savior of the angels, he used to be a human, the king of Salem.”<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-033.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
Not too much to brag about here. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-YusukeFox.png"/> Then the slot-loving TV station president should be here. Let us search the area for him. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-FutabaOracle.png"/> Maybe we’ll find that TV station prez we heard about in here. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-HaruNoir.png"/> In that case, why don’t we try searching for him? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-FutabaOracle.png"/> This place isn’t too big, so spotting him should be easy. Be careful if you find him though! <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-AnnPanther.png"/> He’s the president of a TV station, isn’t he?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-MakotoQueen.png"/> He gives letters of introduction to executives of companies who are willing to sponsor his programs. That’s a difficult condition to meet… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-RyujiSkull.png"/> Wanna just beat it out of him? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-043.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-RyujiSkull.png"/> For real? But… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-MorganaHappy.png"/> I’ll allow it. You’ve got this, Noir.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-045.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-TV_Station_President.jpg"/> A letter of introduction? But you’re so obviously a child. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-HaruNoir.png"/> I am Haru Okumura, daughter of the president of Okumura Foods. I believe we sponsored you as well. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-TV_Station_President.jpg"/> Oh, you’re her? It’s true that I’m quite indebted to President Okumura. He funded us extremely well, after all. However, it looks like he got a little carried away. My condolences. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-TV_Station_President.jpg"/> Regarding his exploiting management… Mr. Shido asked me to defend him as much as I could. I even threw some extra security his way, but there were limits to what I could do. The damage almost reached up to Mr. Shido himself. President Okumura had to be cut off. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-TV_Station_President.jpg"/> It seems he didn’t just cast him off his ship, but also used him to trap the Phantom Thieves. Bravo, Mr. Shido. Truly a nasty maneuver. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-HaruNoir.png"/> Won’t you please give me a letter of recommendation? Once our company recovers, I will arrange for us to cooperate with you in a sponsorship role. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-TV_Station_President.jpg"/> You’re the daughter of the late president. Do you really have the authority to do that? Your employees probably resent you… ...Well, that’s not important. I’m in your father’s debt, after all. I can repay some kindness to his daughter. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-TV_Station_President.jpg"/> But my, your father truly was a fool. <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The TV Station President laughs hysterically.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Uh-oh, Noir’s getting pissed! They’ll never find the bodies!<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-055.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-TV_Station_President.jpg"/> You’re so cute you might just get good ratings.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-ProtagJoker.png"/> <u>Hands off, motherfucker.</u><br/>
<br/>
The man laughs once more. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This fight is actually rather devious, so I’ll walk through it step-by-step.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The leader will start by using Reverse Rub to inflict Rage on one of its allies. The Phantom Thieves are probably going to want to take out this ally immediately for a few reasons, one of which being that it takes much more damage while enraged. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The other ally will be able to use Mediarama to heal on its own turn, as well. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Another reason to take out the enraged foe quickly? Well… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-ProtagJoker.png"/> <u>Oh fuck. Hey, Skull, you mind?</u><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-069.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-071.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-072.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-070.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-RyujiSkull.png"/> <u>Ow.</u><br/>
<br/>
While the Phantom Thieves are capable of tanking hits for their leader with their Protect skill, it’s enough to reduce them to 1 HP immediately, so they need to watch out. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The leader can also use Swift Strike.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-076.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And one more time.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-078.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-079.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-HaruNoir.png"/> <u>It hurts… to breathe...</u><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-ProtagJoker.png"/> <u>Thanks, girl!</u><br/>
<br/>
Once the enraged enemy is dealt with, the rest is rather simple. Both of the remaining foes go down without much in the way of effort.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-081.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Mona learns Mediarahan to replace Mediarama, letting him heal the entire party fully.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-082.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Noir also learns One-shot Kill, an <i>amazing</i> Gun skill that deals Severe damage with a high crit chance. She replaces Amrita Drop with it. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-Introduction_Checklist_3.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And that’s three down for the Phantom Thieves. Ball’s in their corner at this point, I have to admit.<br/>

<br/>
Pff, empty threats! Shido would say that and mean it!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-TV_Station_President.jpg"/> Remember that Kaneshiro guy? The one from the mafia who ended up on the news a while back? Well, the money he was gathering all went to Shido-san.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-MakotoQueen.png"/> Shido and Kaneshiro were connected…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-TV_Station_President.jpg"/> Indeed. As well as that old man Madarame. His counterfeit business along with Kaneshiro’s mafia aided Shido-san quite a lot financially. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-084.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Whaaaaaaaaat? That’s duuuuuuuumb!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-YusukeFox.png"/> I understand now… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-RyujiSkull.png"/> Hey, you were forcin’ the news to be about Akechi and Shido all the time, right? I’m sick of ‘em! ...Wait, this guy’s not a real person. Tellin’ him ain’t gonna do shit for us. <br/>
<br/>
Skull, finally showing some insight.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-Goro.png"/> Oh, certainly not to this extent… But it is important to note that he was the mastermind behind the recent commotion. Getting captured must have wounded his pride irreparably. Such things happen often to insurgent leaders. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Cute_Announcer.jpg"/> According to the police, the whereabouts of the other members are still currently unknown. Considering they no longer require testimony from the leader, the investigation will be hard to--<br/>
