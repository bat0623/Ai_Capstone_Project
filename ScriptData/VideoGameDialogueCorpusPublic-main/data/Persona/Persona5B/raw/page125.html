I actually fucked up here by not immediately purchasing the next book from Jinbocho, so we go for Cry of Cthulhu to compensate.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Inui.png"/> Having executed the royalty, the revolutionaries proceeded to take the courts under their control… All who opposed the revolution were executed. However, the revolutionaries, too, were then reviled as depots and executed by the public. All in all, more than two thousand nine hundred people were executed over the course of the revolution. The fac that this many executions were possible was actually due to one specific invention. Hamiru-kun. Take a look at this. <br/>

This might be my pick for easiest question in the game. You don’t have to know any metaphors or anything, just what that thing Caroline and Justine use to fuse Personas is.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Inui.png"/> That’s correct. By the way, the name “guillotine” comes from Joseph-Ignace Guillotin, the doctor who proposed the idea. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shinya.png"/> I mean, I couldn’t do anything to him… There’s just no way. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-020.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It is pretty weird that this kid couldn’t even seem to hit Takekuma, but there’s plenty of reasonable explanations for that. Still, let’s play along. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shinya.png"/> I’ve been practicing a lot, after all. I’ve heard rumors about Takekuma! People say he uses cheat armor! You know what that is, right? He totally broke the rules by equipping it… I bet that’s why my usual shots didn’t work against him! That has to be the reason! But the next time we play… I’m definitely… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-021.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-022.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shinya.png"/> I’m gonna win next time! Just watch! The thing is… I told my mom about what happened with Takekuma… But… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-capture_157_24052018_113356.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shinya.png"/> She didn’t… really care. All she said was, “OK.”<br/>
<br/>
Well, to be fair to her, most parents don’t really give two shits about the video games their children play. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shinya.png"/> It’s probably because I lost… She doesn’t like kids who lose. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shinya.png"/> My mom once told me that… We need to be strong, because it’s just the two of us. She said no one helps the weak. They just get preyed on… That’s why I wanna get stronger. Strong enough that we won’t get preyed on… Strong enough that WE’D be the predators…<br/>
<br/>
This is getting uncomfortable! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shinya.png"/> That’s exactly who the Phantom Thieves are… the strongest… who can prey on anyone. Once I become the strongest, my mom will be able to count on me… The only way I can win is through games… That’s why I can’t lose. …… What should I do about Takekuma’s armor…? The strategy I used last time didn’t work… <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Shinya.png"/> ...Thanks. ...You’re kinda like a big brother to me. I can talk to you about anything… I heard that that’s what it’s like to have a sibling… <br/>

This one is straight-up incredible. It increases everyone’s number of bullets by a hell of a lot:<br/>
<ul class="bbc-list">
<li>Maaku goes from 16 bullets to 32.<br/>
</li><li>Ryuji goes from 8 to 16.<br/>
</li><li>Morgana goes from 15 to 25.<br/>
</li><li>Ann goes from 36 to 60.<br/>
</li><li>Yusuke goes from 24 to 48.<br/>
</li><li>Makoto goes from 12 to 24.<br/>
</li><li>Haru goes from 6 to 12.<br/>
</li></ul>
Now, it doesn’t improve anyone’s clip sizes, but it’s still really great. We haven’t been using guns too much because they’re honestly kind of lame for anything other than hitting weaknesses, but this is a great excuse to whip them out (uh, phrasing) more often. It’s also a great way to justify using Down Shot more often. <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-FutabaJacket.png"/> But Sojiro…! I-I only did it ‘cause of all that stuff he said to you! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Sojiro.png"/> About that… I’ve been thinking. When push came to shove, I wasn’t there to help you… So, you know… maybe there’s somewhere better for you out there… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-FutabaJacket.png"/> S-Somewhere better…? Am I not supposed to be here…? Am I just in the way…?<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Sojiro.png"/> Makes sense though… You’re the ones who saved her, after all. ...Where did I go wrong? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Sojiro.png"/> I really did try to care for Futaba. ...Look where that got me though. I told myself she was the reason I kept making Wakaba’s curry here… but deep down, I think that was just an excuse to stay distant… At the end of the day, the coffee and the curry people love so much are both just… excuses. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-FutabaJacket.png"/> Yeah… Thanks… Y’know, Mom used to talk about Sojiro tons when I was little. How good he was at making curry, how interesting he was to talk to… I remember everything. I even remember how she smiled when she talked about him… Mom really liked Sojiro… …… I said some real mean stuff tonight. It’s not his fault Mom’s incident happened… It’s not his fault I shut myself away from the world… And because of me… Sojiro lost a crapton of money… I just thought I’d be able to stay here with him if my hacking worked… <br/>

Mishima has new information for us. This will be the last request we receive from progressing his Confidant. Contrary to what I previously believed, you do not need to complete the requests as you receive them to progress the Confidant. Instead, you need to complete a certain number of the requests he’ll send you (so not ones for other Confidants) to unlock his final rank event. For context, we’ve done eleven such requests, which is already enough, but we’ll be doing the rest too. <br/>

This is honestly a pretty annoying ability. “Search objects” are objects in the field that spawn sellable loot (or occasionally a consumable item) that can be stolen. With this ability, they have a chance to respawn after <i>every single battle</i>. All of them. We’re going to see this a lot, is what I’m saying. The animation takes a few seconds, too. However, the real issue is that in Palaces we’re not actually backtracking all that often, meaning we’re not really going to have many opportunities to take advantage of this. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="151-Iwai.png"/> If he was smugglin’ all that shit in, why would he come to me askin’ for modified guns? I mean, don’t somethin’ about that seem off to you? <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="156-137.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="151-Iwai.png"/> That piece of shit’s tryin’ to lord his position over me… but he ain’t got shit now! What I’m really sayin’ here is… I don’t think those Hong Kong guys ever delivered on their end of the deal. They prolly just took his money and flat out stiffed him on the guns. Masa told me somethin’ real weird back when you and Kaoru were over at the diner though. Apparently, the clan’s been treatin’ that Hong Kong transaction like some kinda massive business success. That means Tsuda’s been lyin’ to ’em this whole time… And now he’s tryin’ to use me to cover up his mistake. <br/>
<br/>
Uhh, I thought you didn’t sell real guns? Y’know, they only <i>look</i> real? What is the yakuza gonna do with a bunch of airsoft weapons?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="157-138.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Even if I’m totally misunderstanding this dude’s plan, which seems likely, it doesn’t actually seem that smart to me. Even assuming Iwai is getting them real guns somehow, for the deal Tsuda likely had with the Hong Kong mafia you’d think there’d probably be a sizeable quantity of hardware. How would Iwai manage to replicate all that, on short notice, for free?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="158-139.jpg"/><br/> 
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="151-Iwai.png"/> ...Don’t matter now though. Everything’s gonna change once I tell the clan what’s up. Tsuda’s not gonna be able to keep intimidatin’ me anymore. And I’ll make sure Kaoru won’t get labeled, like I was… He’ll be a regular, respectable adult. Somethin’ I coulda never even dreamed of… I’m gonna have to talk to Tsuda himself first though. Gotta follow the yakuza code.<br/>
<br/>
What!? No, this sounds like a great plan as long as your end goal is to be somewhere deep in the ocean. The fucking “yakuza code,” are you kidding me!? You’re not even yakuza anymore!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="151-Iwai.png"/> …… Hey, I got a favor to ask of you. If anythin’ happens to me, take care of Kaoru, OK?<br/>
<br/>
I’m seventeen, my dude. I’m not sure what you want me to do here.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="151-Iwai.png"/> …OK?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="159-140.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="151-Iwai.png"/> Yeah. I’d like to think he’s above thug shit like that… But if he wanted, he could get rid of me no problem. Unless I had some kinda witness with me, that is…<br/>
<br/>
Oh fuck no. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="151-Iwai.png"/> Wait a sec. I’ve got you.<br/>
<br/>
SHIT<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="160-capture_001_24052018_151601.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="151-Iwai.png"/> I want you to come talk to Tsuda with me. He’s not gonna dare lay a finger on a civilian kid. It’d cause way too many complications for him.<br/>
<br/>
Are you sure about that? Because I’m not. I’ve got a record, you know. The authorities ain’t gonna give two shits about me.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="151-Iwai.png"/> If you come as my witness, things’ll be miles safer. ...All right then. It’s settled. <br/>
<br/>
I didn’t say shit, asshole!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="161-141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="151-Iwai.png"/> Oh, and lemme think of a reward. Gotta thank you for the info, and for bein’ my witness. How ‘bout I work even harder on that special menu? That should be good for you, yeah? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Protag.png"/> *nods*<br/>
<br/>
*sigh* Goddammit...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Protag.png"/> <i>It feels like my bond with Iwai is growing even deeper...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="162-142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We really gotta customize some guns at <i>some</i> point.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="151-Iwai.png"/> Well, I’ll hit you up when it’s time. Let’s do this, kid. Thanks for today. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="163-143.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="164-MorganaSquint.png"/> Huh…? Who could that be at this hour…? <br/>

<br/>
Okay, I know I decided to lighten up on you, Mishima, but I’m not sure I want to go to “Dome Town” with you.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="124-MishimaChat.png"/> Earlier I got some info that I can’t turn a blind eye to. I got us two passes. Wanna go and check it out tomorrow?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="166-145.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Actually, let’s do it. Mishima deserves something nice after playing hero and I deserve something nice before my imminent fitting for concrete shoes. Also I feel bad that he already bought the passes like the poor, lonely fool he is. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="167-146.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Morgana.png"/> Dome Town is an amusement park, right? Tomorrow should be fun.
