<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Murmur.jpg"/> Did the Phantom Thieves really do that? Maybe people are just having fun, giving them credit for a coincidence… I mean, no one can actually steal someone’s heart—that’s just some urban legend noise.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chatter.jpg"/> Isn’t that what people said about that hacker group, too? It’s just a nice way of saying they’re blackmailing bad people into confessing their crimes! Who’re you to doubt the Phantom Thieves, anyhow?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Murmur.jpg"/> ...What?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Boy_2.jpg"/> Yeah, they’ve really taken off since the whole Kamoshida thing. The legend of the Phantom Thieves started at OUR school! We’re practically one of them!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Boy_5.jpg"/> And who can’t relate to what they’re doing? Punishing corrupt adults up to no good—the police should take notes.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Inui.png"/> Behind Kaneshiro’s arrest are the “Phantom Thieves,” the mysterious group that changes people’s hearts. If I recall, there were similar rumors back during that business with Kamoshida-kun. Help the weak and crush the strong… Truly a modern legend of the gentleman thief. In the long history of humans, the gentleman thief has been seen briefly during times of turmoil. Now then, please look at this picture. Hamiru-kun.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Inui.png"/> What was the name of the gentleman thief whose family was boiled alive during the Sengoku period?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ha, your own name is up there as an option.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Inui.png"/> Correct. As I’m sure you know, this is the origin of the term “Goemon bath,” or a bath heated from the bottom. Only stealing from the rich and powerful, and sharing with the poor… Goemon’s exploits have been documented in many forms of media, like kabuki and novels.<br/>
<br/>
Maaku gains <b>Knowledge +1</b>.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Inui.png"/> However, it’s actually unclear whether or not Goemon was indeed a gentleman thief. Rebellion against Hideyoshi, whose campaign had failed; propaganda by the government to sully his name… The gentleman thief Goemon may be no more than an illusion made by varying motivations. In actuality, most heroes and gentleman thieves throughout history are something like that.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> Let’s make sure people don’t think we’re just an illusion. But before that, you need to study for the exams that are starting tomorrow.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> I’d be pretty sad if the leader of the Phantom Thieves got bad grades.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Protag.png"/> &gt;I’ll give it a try.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> That’s the spirit!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Chatter.jpg"/> I’ve seen it in Shibuya before too! It’s like, totally cool. I hope they keep it up. I’ve been rooting for them this whole time! Aren’t they incredible? I heard they’re really gaining momentum. By the way, this is a damn good drawing. Is Hamiru a Phanboy?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> I think our popularity’s rising! We’re really starting to get famous!<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Stalker.jpg"/> I-I-I… *mumble*<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Ikesugi.jpg"/> I’m not sure what’s going on, but just relax. Let’s take our time, and try to talk normally.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like our stalker’s change of heart went through.<br/>

<br/>
Next, we need to clear a Persona slot to make room to resummon an Eligor <i>again</i>. We choose to fuse this Kin-Ki from Flauros and Nue.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yes, I can see that, but what’s your name?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Kin-ki.jpg"/> If you possess the mask, I will grant you the power of an unyielding heart...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Kin-Ki is another of the four oni controlled by Fujiwara No Chikata. It’s named after gold and its body is so strong that no weapons in existence can pierce it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
But we’re not done here yet. A little while back we unlocked a new feature called “Lockdown," and now’s the perfect time to show it off, for reasons I’ll explore shortly.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The cell’s empty for now, but that’ll change. Let’s get some explanations of this new system.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Caroline.png"/> If you toss one of your Personas in a cell, we’ll give it some special training to help it grow. While you’re off loafing around, your Persona’s getting stronger… We treat you too well, Inmate! Oh, but we only keep one Persona in Lockdown at a time. This is solitary confinement, after all. And naturally, you’re not gonna be able to use that Persona in battle or fusion. Don’t forget, Inmate!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Caroline.png"/> Once the training is over, the Persona you put in Lockdown’ll learn a new resistance. There’re times it’ll learn something different too though. That’s all up to chance. Either way, the stuff it learns will all be useful to you, Inmate.* Oh, and the higher the Confidant rank for the Persona’s arcana, the shorter they’ll need to train for. Don’t forget Master’s words… Forging Confidants is gonna help you on the road to rehabilitation.<br/>
<br/>
*The stuff it learns may not all be useful. <br/>
<br/>
I have no idea what “there are times it’ll learn something different” means, unless it means Null Skills instead of Resist skills.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Caroline.png"/> It takes a set number of days ‘til a Persona’s training ends… but don’t forget it’s in there, OK? Personas are part of your heart, after all. If you leave it in for to long, it’ll disappear forever. Well, we’re not evil though. We’ll let you know if that’s gonna happen soon. But it’ll be on you from there on. Don’t come crying to us once you realize how stupid you were.<br/>
<br/>
So, they’ll call you once the time is about to expire, but that’s probably not going to be a lot of help on story days you can’t go outside, which is part of the reason I never ended up using this feature on my first run. <br/>
<br/>
Another reason? It’s really not that good. The resistances it provides are in the forms of skills, which are useful in that they can be passed on, but annoying in that they take up a skill slot, which are already at a premium on anything we’re fusing at this point in the game. Now, there’s reason to believe (mainly from GameFAQs posts that are unverifiable without careful testing, natch) that leaving a Persona in Lockdown for longer than you have to will give you a better chance of getting a good skill. Well, I don’t know about that, but we’ll try this out anyway. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Clotho has two weaknesses, so an extra resistance would be great. Let’s put her into Lockdown.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Sorry!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Outside of the Velvet Room (and before we resummon that Eligor), we can see this icon on Clotho’s name, indicating that she is in Lockdown. Now, the great thing I never realized about Lockdown is that while you can’t use or fuse the Persona, <i>it’s still technically in your deck.</i> This means you can get bonus Confidant points for a matching Arcana without pulling it out of Lockdown if you so choose. Considering how long it takes to get all 12 Persona slots in this game, it’s really handy that the game does you a solid this once.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Brother.jpg"/> Hahaha, don’t get so excited. You’ll fall off, you know.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-YusukeBlue.png"/> Perfect… This is it.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-YusukeBlue.png"/> My previous painting captured only one aspect of the heart: desire. As such, I was unable to arrive at a truly artistic representation… That is why we have come today. I shall paint a second aspect… the burning passion between man and woman! Fittingly, our theme today will be… the wonders of love!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-YusukeBlue.png"/> You will have an important role to play here today as well. While I draw, ensure the boat remains as steady as possible amid these devilish ripples.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-YusukeBlue.png"/> Ah, this angle… Incredible! That bashful side profile, those moist eyes… Their overflowing passion is wholly evident!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-YusukeBlue.png"/> They are akin to Adam and Eve… yet in time all lovers must come to know the pain of separation… Separation is the natural end to any such relationship… but even beyond that, love endures. Precisely… This is the truth of the human heart! *chuckle* It will make the most wonderful painting…! It shall be adored by all who gaze upon it! It may even be given top prize in the next exhibition…! Wait, now is not the time to be thinking of such trivial matters…!<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Brother.jpg"/> Wh-What the hell’re you doing!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-YusukeBlue.png"/> Rejoice, for I shall preserve your beautiful love so that all coming generations may bask in its glory. Once I complete this painting, you will become new legends in the art world… A modern Adam and Eve!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Sister.jpg"/> L-Legends? Art…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Brother.jpg"/> This dude’s off his rocker… Come on, let’s report him.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Brother.jpg"/> Hold on a sec… Are you drawing us!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Sister.jpg"/> What!? You’re using us as models!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-YusukeBlue.png"/> A man and woman intimately swaying in a dinghy of dreams… The blush of their cheeks, the bashful looks… Yes, this is the love I was so emphatically searching for!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Brother.jpg"/> …Love?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Sister.jpg"/> Uh, I guess you could call it that… but it’s kinda weird...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
ABORT MISSION! ABORT MISSION!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Brother.jpg"/> Ugh… I told you I didn’t wanna come here with you. The only ones who do this crap are stupid couples.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Sister.jpg"/> But I’ve always dreamed of coming to Tokyo and riding a boat here! Though it was supposed to be with my boyfriend… not my brother!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-YusukeBlue.png"/> So that overflowing passion was just a figment of my imagination…? It seems my bias has caused me to overlook the truth of the matter...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-038.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-YusukeBlue.png"/> Hm, romantic love and familial love… The two may be nigh indiscernible depending on one’s point of view. <br/>
<br/>
What? No. Gross.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-YusukeBlue.png"/> Perhaps… the truth of the heart lies in the eye of the beholder. Maaku, I feel as though I’ve learned something today…!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Protag.png"/> <i>I can sense a quiet resolve from Yusuke...</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-041.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
Gay jokes! Fun!<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> Oh, he really scammed a lot of people. I guess we’ll just leave the rest to the police.<br/>

<br/>
Yikes, six new messages. One of these is the bog-standard “Please hang out with me oh god I’m so lonely,” and another is a request from Ryuji to study (which will give us Knowledge +3 and a bunch of points with Ryuji, neither of which we actually need, sorry Ryuji), but the other four are responses to completing the Mementos requests.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> Mm-hm! I snuck in and left it there without anyone noticing.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-AnnChat.png"/> Oh, and there was a post saying the culprit’s gonna turn himself in.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-RyujiChat.png"/> I’m sure his little bro’ll be shocked to hear he got caught.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-AnnChat.png"/> Well either way, I think it should be better than how things were before.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> Man, you guys really like keeping busy. Not that that’s a bad thing.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-AnnChat.png"/> Anyway, that takes care of those restaurant burglars!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> Things may have gotten a bit crazy, but it all turned out OK in the end.<br/>
<br/>
It’s a bit unusual that we’re getting more than a few lines from Mishima about a simple Mementos request completion. Even the beginning of this one was more drawn-out than usual. Well, the reason for that is because before Persona 5 released, there was an OVA called The Daybreakers produced that took place about a month before this point in the story. This request was a tie-in to that, you see, which is why it was all so much more involved than normal.<br/>
<br/>
Also there’s still no reward, fuck you.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-049.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-MishimaChat.png"/> She even apologzied online and everything. You know who she is, right? Why don’t you go check on her?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> It seems she really did have a change of heart. Nice work!<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-MishimaChat.png"/> I heard both of them ended up turning themselves in to the teachers. Things should be peaceful at school from now on. Well done!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> It looks like the double change of heart was a massive success! Keep up the good work!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-053.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-MishimaChat.png"/> The student ended up quitting his part-time job there too. Apparently company HQ tried to offer him money to keep quiet, and he just couldn’t accept that. Still, he was really moved by what the Phantom Thieves did. I quote, “I can’t believe they wanted to help solve a nothing high schooler’s problems. Even I’m happy hearing that!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Morgana.png"/> We really did a great job this time. Hearing how touched the student was is an added bonus too. I guess there really are all sorts of desires hidden away in the dark corners of Mementos...<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Chihaya.png"/> This is quite a serious situation for a fortune teller like me. I need to get to the bottom of this. You won’t have to do anything. Just sit next to me while I tell fortunes. And if another unopposable fate happens to appear… then I’ll test your power.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Chihaya.png"/> Well… that may be true… Oh, I know… I’ll read your fortune! Please? I’ll even prioritize your readings over my regular customers. Besides, I’ll be able to provide much more accurate predictions once I get to know you better! How does that sound? Is it a deal? *sigh* Otherwise, I won’t be able to go on… Please, I beg you… I need to know if fate can truly be changed…<br/>
<br/>

Fortune portends luck (good or bad, depending on the orientation), karma, and destiny, but when reversed represents negative forces outside of one’s control.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so despite my rather clear distaste for Chihaya as a person (I should mention I never got her beyond Rank 3 in my original run), her skills can be quite useful. However, her selection of skills is somewhat… eclectic. In fact, I would say that her skills range from “literal worst garbage in the whole entire game” to “fucking essential.” We’re probably going to be blitzing through Chihaya’s Confidant pretty fast for one of these abilities that is going to be pretty much necessary to see everything we want to. <br/>
<br/>
This current ability, Luck Reading, is one of those useful skills, for the record. It lets us add another “note” any time we gain points in a social stat for the rest of the day after the reading, and doesn’t take time. Now, apparently the boosted point doesn’t display (looking into this, apparently the actual value of each note can be one of multiple values, not just 1, 2, or 3, and that’s the number that gets a 50% boost from the Luck Reading, which is then rounded down,) when it would go from +2 to +3. If this is true, it’ll make the points a little inaccurate, but no one’s counting these anyway so it’s fine. There’s still a benefit, so it really doesn’t matter.<br/>
<br/>
Buuuuuut, while we’re here, let’s explore how those stats work, courtesy of some Japanese wiki I found! 1 note is 2 points, 2 notes are 3 or 4 points (but functionally always 3 points unless it’s boosted), and 3 notes are either 5, 7 (certain activities like special books that take three “periods” instead of two to complete, or a boosted 5), or <b>10</b> (a boosted 7). This means that, yes, a Luck Reading boost of 50% will increase one note to two, but never two notes to three, because the number is rounded down.<br/>

<br/>
Wait a second. The nurse picked up the phone. Have we been directly calling Kawakami instead of the maid service this entire time? I guess that’d explain why she always was the one to pick up the phone, but it’s pretty weird. Also, the nurse knew our name, which means that Kawakami told her that we’d be calling. That’s not a plot hole, I just think it’s really sad that we’re the only person who might be calling her.<br/>

I’m really loving this scam you two got going here, especially the Mrs.’s role in it all. The man comes in all angry and forceful, and the lady contrasts with “care” and “understanding,” while piling on the guilt. Make no mistake, this is a practiced, confident shittiness.<br/>
