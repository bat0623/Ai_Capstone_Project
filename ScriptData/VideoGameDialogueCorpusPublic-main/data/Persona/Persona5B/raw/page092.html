<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-RyujiYellow.png"/> Boss! Hello! <br/>
<br/>
<b>Music:</b> <a href="https://clyp.it/lagqt0z3?token=69be7fab85fbd81172a7f8796367ddc4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alright</a><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-RyujiYellow.png"/> Yo, you look tired. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnTankTop.png"/> We’ve made ourselves at home. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-TV.jpg"/> The site’s main page now displays what is thought to be the mark belonging to the Phantom Thieves… Moreso, the personal information of a Japanese man, a possible Medjed member, was illegally publicized.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Sojiro.png"/> Aren’t these the guys people have been up in arms about? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-TV.jpg"/> Medjed has yet to issue an official reply. Furthermore, their previously announced cleanse of Japan has remained unimplemented for now. Some speculate that they have taken this series of events seriously and ultimately canceled their plan.<br/>
<br/>
Futaba didn’t really… do much, did she? Doxxed one person and hacked a website. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The group starts giggling and cheering quietly. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Sojiro.png"/> What’re you all smirking about…? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Sojiro.png"/> Well stop it. You’re gonna drive away all my customers. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-TV.jpg"/> After the commercial break, we will be asking guests from various fields about this turn of events. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-RyujiYellow.png"/> But there ain’t any customers…?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Sojiro.png"/> Can it… My customers are on summer vacation too. <br/>
<br/>
Ha. Poor Sojiro.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-RyujiYellow.png"/> Oh crap, I just realized our break’s almost over! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-YusukeCollarless.png"/> There are still ten days left. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnTankTop.png"/> I wanna go somewhere, but we can’t just leave Futaba-chan alone. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> Some things still concern me too, like that “research”… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Sojiro.png"/> Oh! Did you just get up? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-FutabaTankTop.png"/> *nods*<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> Good morning. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-YusukeCollarless.png"/> It seems she’s cautious of us… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> Hey, why don’t we go upstairs? If any customers come, she’ll be even more afraid. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Sojiro.png"/> Why don’t you go with them, Futaba? Have fun. It’s about time my regulars show up anyway, so I don’t want you guys loitering around my store. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh hey, this asshole again!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-S.png"/> The issue I want to make clear is the attitude of the police, and more importantly, the government. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-TV.jpg"/> What do you mean? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-S.png"/> Are they doing their best to find an effective countermeasure against these Phantom Thieves? Is it not the government’s duty to create a society where its citizens can live without worry?<br/>
<br/>
Hey! Under the Phantom Thieves, you only have to worry if you’re an <i>undesirable!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-S.png"/> Unfortunately, the current cabinet is powerless. As such, they should be disbanded. I believe now is the time for me to risk my political career in hope of making a new reality. A new political system that goes beyond parties or factions… An ideal country of peace and order… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Old_Man.jpg"/> This politician seems quite promising.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Old_Woman.jpg"/> I have to agree. I hope he can work to ease the anxieties of the elderly. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Old_Man.jpg"/> What do you think, Boss?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Sojiro.png"/> Hm? Oh sorry, I wasn’t listening.<br/>
<br/>
Rude!<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Sae.png"/> And Medjed was in turn defeated by her real-world hacking abilities? This does correlate to the facts as we know them… If he’s telling the truth, then Wakaba Isshiki didn’t commit suicide… Did a third party target her life with the goal of destroying her research…? Wakaba’s death was two years ago… That also coincides with when the incidents started occurring… Does this other Metaverse user that Madarame and Kaneshiro mentioned… really exist…? Earlier, I briefly mentioned about those psychotic breakdown incidents that have alarmed the public. All of a sudden, people will lose consciousness or become violent… A situation as incomprehensible as that can’t be explained away as “troubled social conditions.” ...I suspect that these cases are all connected to a larger, man-made plot. The method involved always muddled the explication, but your story has virtually confirmed its viability. <br/>
<br/>
Oh man, this is some fresh word salad. Who the fuck uses the word “explication”?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Sae.png"/> Although, I wouldn’t have expected a new criminal to come to light from your testimony… What did your group think of this other Metaverse user?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Sae.png"/> How self-centered of you. The Phantom Thieves tamper with people’s hearts without consent. How is that different? Well… no matter how you thought of them, there can be no doubting your resolve. Are those incidents because of you or someone else…? Either way, I will get to the bottom of this. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-ProtagInterro.png"/> <i>I feel like my bond with Sae is growing deeper...</i><br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Sae.png"/> Kunikazu Okumura… You should know who he is. ...Considering what happened. Your testimony regarding this incident will be serious. I’m sure you understand why. Answer my next question carefully. What did you do to this Okumura? <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-YusukeCollarless.png"/> To think the cognitive version of a person would transform into a such a horrible monster and attack us… That means our enemies aren’t limited to Shadows. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnTankTop.png"/> I thought the other people were just victims, like the slaves at the castle or the walking ATMs. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> Even though they seem to be alive, they’re only part of the backdrop… the environment. In other words, the Palace ruler determines the form and strength of their cognitions. I would have loved to ask Futaba’s mother how far along she was with her research… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-RyujiYellow.png"/> Research, huh… She was lookin’ into that cognitive psience stuff, yeah?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> If we put together all the information we’ve gathered up to this point… Abuse of cognitive psience can lead to death, and it may even relate to the psychotic breakdown incidents. Considering the “cognitive” aspect, I sense a strong connection between it and the Metaverse.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Morgana.png"/> On top of that, the research might have been stolen and used by someone else. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnTankTop.png"/> You mean those guys that showed Futaba-chan the fake suicide note. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-YusukeCollarless.png"/> If that is the case, those people are unforgivable. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> Hey, Futaba. Is there anything else you can remember? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-015.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-016.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Futaba comes back, with more food. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnTankTop.png"/> C’mon, no fair… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-RyujiYellow.png"/> Hey, can I snag a bite? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Futaba stares Ryuji down.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-RyujiYellow.png"/> ...Meanie. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> Why don’t we take a short break? <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> Even if Futaba is a genius, could she really crush an international hacker organization that easily?<br/>
<br/>
What are you talking about, Makoto? This is anime. Of course she could.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-FutabaTankTop.png"/> The one who taunted the Phantom Thieves was a guy in Japan. I knew the Medjed members in Japan weren’t anything special, so I wasn’t worried. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnTankTop.png"/> How do you know that? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-FutabaTankTop.png"/> ‘Cause I’m the founder.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Theeeeere we go.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> Um… what do you mean? Should we take that literally? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-FutabaTankTop.png"/> Yep. It was only me at first, back when I was referred to as the hacker of justice. But since I stayed anonymous, a buncha guys from all over the world started using the name. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnTankTop.png"/> And those were the ones committing cybercrimes. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-FutabaTankTop.png"/> It was a hassle to expose all of them, so I just left them be. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-RyujiYellow.png"/> Uhhh… so Futaba was the true Medjed, and we were freakin’ out over some weak-ass dipshits? <br/>
<br/>
Yep. Seems like the threat has been completely undermined! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-RyujiYellow.png"/> You should’ve told us from the start, Futaba. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-FutabaTankTop.png"/> I discarded the Medjed name a while ago. I’m Alibaba now. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> Futaba, what do you want to do now? Since you know our secret, we’d like you to join our team. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Simple enough! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnTankTop.png"/> Just like that…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> This may even ensure our investigation of Mementos goes along smoothly. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Morgana.png"/> Well… I guess. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-RyujiYellow.png"/> Well, Futaba’s real amazin’! She’s gonna be a big help for us, huh? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> Say, Futaba. How did you find out about us? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-FutabaTankTop.png"/> Secret. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> Where did you learn to hack? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-FutabaTankTop.png"/> Private. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> When did you obtain the Nav? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-FutabaTankTop.png"/> I refuse to answer.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnTankTop.png"/> Futaba-chan sure is unique… Still, it’ll be a problem if she doesn’t open up to us some more. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-YusukeCollarless.png"/> At the very least, we need to be able to communicate normally with her. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> What should we do?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-023.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnTankTop.png"/> How? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> First, we’ll need to help her open up to us. If we each spend an entire day with her, maybe she’ll get more used to being around us.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-YusukeCollarless.png"/> I see. We do have the time, thanks to summer vacation.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> We can begin tomorrow. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-RyujiYellow.png"/> Let’s go to the beach! There’ll be tonsa people there, plus we got totally dried out in that desert. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnTankTop.png"/> That’s a great idea! I forgot I hadn’t gone to the beach yet! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-FutabaTankTop.png"/> Uh, excuse me…? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> I’ll come by tomorrow. See you then. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-YusukeCollarless.png"/> Let me help as well. I don’t have anything planned. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-MakotoSummerCasual.png"/> Thanks. We can set a schedule with everyone else depending on when they’re free. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-AnnTankTop.png"/> OK!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-025.jpg"/><br/>

Futaba grabs Morgana’s face and begins pulling on it.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
What a weirdly patronizing and sexist thing to say, Akechi! Wow!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Sae.png"/> How can I stay calm about this!?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-GoroSummer.png"/> I understand how you feel. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Sae.png"/> Thanks to the incident with those hackers, people are calling us incompetent. And on top of all that, the Phantom Thieves are claiming justice is on their side. Don’t make me laugh.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-GoroSummer.png"/> Medjed was dealt with by either the Phantom Thieves themselves, or some avid supporter. There are no tracks whatsoever, so they must be quite skilled… Either way, the general public recognizes the Phantom Thieves as the subjugating party. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Sae.png"/> They’re gaining support and influence much faster than we could have anticipated… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-GoroSummer.png"/> It is indeed an abnormal situation. I’m beginning to suspect mass manipulation of some kind… It’s even possible that a powerful person is behind them, plotting the psychotic breakdowns… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Sae.png"/> It’s rare to hear you speak in that tone. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-RyujiChat.png"/> They were saying how awesome they think the Phantom Thieves are! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-AnnChat.png"/> I’ve heard things too. It’s becoming a huge topic of conversation. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-MakotoChat.jpg"/> Yeah, it’s really all thanks to Alibaba. You were a great help. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-FutabaChat.jpg"/> It was nothing.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-AnnChat.png"/> Oh, that reminds me… Remember that stuff about ATMs and banks just stopping? That wasn’t Medjed, was it? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-FutabaChat.jpg"/> Nope, that was totally separate. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-MakotoChat.jpg"/> So people were overreacting to mere coincidence? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-FutabaChat.jpg"/> Either that or those rumors were never true to begin with. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Hm, you seem to be quite talkative in these conversations. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-FutabaChat.jpg"/> Is that so? I’ll shut up then.<br/>
<br/>
Great job, Yusuke.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-FutabaChat.jpg"/> :|<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-YusukeChat.jpg"/> ……?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-FutabaChat.jpg"/> &gt;:C<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-AnnChat.png"/> I don’t think I get it, but I’m pretty sure she’s angry… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-RyujiChat.png"/> You gotta apologize, Yusuke.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-YusukeChat.jpg"/> Me? Why? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-FutabaChat.jpg"/> :U<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Morgana.png"/> Hey, is this really going to be OK? I’m worried about how things will be from now on… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-034.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-035.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-MishimaChat.png"/> There’s no doubt about it! I mean, they took Medjed down. Even the guys who had been criticizing the Phantom Thieves basically have to accept them now! The news has been spreading like wildfire too. I’ll give it an extra boost on my site as well. I bet the approval rating will be through the roof tomorrow. Look forward to it! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Morgana.png"/> ...Why is he of all people getting excited about this? Well, the news really did draw a lot of attention. I can’t wait to see what happens. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
So, our current sub-objective next to “Prove your justice to society” is “Rid Futaba of her unease.” Simple.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is one of the rare instances where we have our day consumed but not our night. For the next several days we’ll start in the attic, yes, but we’ll <i>actually have the freedom to leave, holy shit!</i> However, we’ll be spending our days helping Futaba because <s>the game doesn’t want us going to Mementos right now until Futaba gets her codename</s> she needs our guidance.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Morgana.png"/> Even so, we should keep at it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-TV.jpg"/> Temperatures are rising across the country, marking the hottest days we’ve had this summer. Today’s temperature is at a record high, and many are escaping the heat by playing in the water. Throngs of people could be seen at the beach near the city, enjoying the summer weather. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Morgana.png"/> You have to go to the beach in the summer! We should go! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Man_6.jpg"/> It’s not worth going to any beaches in Japan. They’re cramped and dirty; there’s jellyfish… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Woman_5.jpg"/> What about a beach outside of Japan? Let’s go on a vacation on a tropical island! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Man_6.jpg"/> We don’t have to go now, right? It’s absurd to go somewhere hot in the middle of summer.<br/>
<br/>
I don’t even like the beach or being outside in general, but holy shit, SEVER.<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Grade_Schooler_2.jpg"/> Mine say the same thing! My mom said not to get all proud and arrogant and stuff… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Grade_Schooler_1.jpg"/> Yeah, right. Don’t listen to her. Grown-ups lie all the time. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Grade_Schooler_2.jpg"/> I know! My parents were supposed to take me to the zoo the other day, but they broke their promise! <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-College_Student_2.jpg"/> I wonder how they pulled it off… They really are amazing, huh.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-College_Student_1.jpg"/> Hey-ey, whatever happened to that Akechi dude? The Phantom Thieves buried that guy—total annihilation!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Office_Worker_2.jpg"/> We should be relieved that nothing happened. What’s more ominous is the Phantom Thieves. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Office_Worker_4.jpg"/> How so? I thought they did well this time… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Office_Worker_2.jpg"/> Gaining power moves one closer to becoming an authoritarian. That’s just the way of the world.<br/>
<br/>
FULL ANARCHY NOW<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Office_Worker_3.jpg"/> Yes, I think so. Nothing bad actually happened, so it looks like we’ll all be safe. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Office_Worker_2.jpg"/> They admitted their wrongdoing on their own. If our superiors could do that too, it’d be real nice. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Office_Worker_3.jpg"/> Hahaha, that’d be great. It’d be even better if that happened in every company. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-Foreign_Barker.jpg"/> The Phantom Thieves are awesome! They’re like a manga come to life! But, I mean—we can’t rely on them for everything, right? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Drunk_Regular.jpg"/> Huh? Why not? Stop lecturing us! <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Homeless_Man.jpg"/> You were listening, huh? Scram if you don’t wanna get hurt. The more you struggle and resist in vain, the worse your pain and suffering, you know? Though, it’s always more fun for me when the other guy struggles… *chuckle* <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Rural_Young_Man.jpg"/> They’re really somethin’ else. I wanna apprentice with ‘em.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Adorable_Woman.jpg"/> I’m glad you’re finally getting it. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Rural_Young_Man.jpg"/> Yup. Lemme get ya somethin’ nice from the gift store back home—to show I’m sorry.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Adorable_Woman.jpg"/> I take it back. You clearly don’t get it yet! <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Fishy_Hawker.jpg"/> This is your chance to meet those mysterious superheroes, the “Phantom Thieves!” You interested? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Fishy_Hawker.jpg"/> Relax, this’ll only take a second. Just a few seconds, OK? We’re celebrating Medjed’s fall with a party event: An Evening Chat with the Phantom Thieves. Of course, the Phantom Thieves will show up as well! It’ll be a fancy dinner at not a bad price! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Fishy_Hawker.jpg"/> What? You scared of the Phantom Thieves showing up? What are you, chicken? Well, in that case, go home already, kid! Geez, I’m wastin’ my breath here! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Beefy_Trendsetter.jpg"/> He must be hurting so much inside. I wish I could cheer up my dearest Akechi-kun… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Scruffy_Romantic.jpg"/> “My Akechi-kun,” my ass. Your sparkly eyes are hilarious next to your five o’clock shadow.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Beefy_Trendsetter.jpg"/> You’ve got nose hair sticking out too, you bushy-haired beast!<br/>
<br/>
Ugh. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Office_Worker_3.jpg"/> It’s a heavy burden, making my dream—OUR dream—come true. I was unable to shoulder that. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-Woman_7.jpg"/> Yeah… I gotta work hard to make our dreams come true. You’re right, Mr. Asakura. But I know I can do it! <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-Office_Worker.jpg"/> I’d like to ask for a young person’s opinion on the recent fluctuation in stock prices… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Morgana.png"/> ...Well, you might as well humor him. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-Miserable_Businessman.jpg"/> G-Good evening… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> Oh, my… You look quite exhausted. Here, have a seat.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-Miserable_Businessman.jpg"/> As soon as I talk back, he makes sure I know I’m lower than him. He insinuates he’ll demote me… After that, I’ll overhear him talking about me, calling me useless while I’m at work… And everything I’ve done, all the results I’m getting… Somehow, he’s taking all the credit. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> That is the worst kind of workplace abuse. I cannot believe that man… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-Miserable_Businessman.jpg"/> So many people have quit because of stress. And yet, the higher-ups all ignore it. Of all the terrible bosses I could get in the world, why did mine have to be <b>Shinsuke Kishi</b>? *sigh* Hey, Lala. I wish the Phantom Thieves could do something and help me with this… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-Lala_Escargot.jpg"/> Like how? Are you going to ask them to steal all your stress away? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-Miserable_Businessman.jpg"/> Hahaha… No. I guess it’s impossible. But it’s nice to think about… <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="118-Igor.png"/> It seems you freed the heart of a frenzied girl and saved her from her haunted past. *chuckle* Another step has been taken to rehabilitation… You are progressing quite nicely.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-Caroline.png"/> Our master bestows words of praise upon you! You’d better feel honored! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="118-Igor.png"/> By the by, more curious information has found its way to your ears.<br/>
<br/>
At times it can feel like the translators really wanted to use a weird word or choice of phrase that ends up sticking out badly. “By the by” is not a thing an actual human would ever say, and don’t be a smartass and reply to that with “Igor isn’t human.” It’s creepy and weird in a completely separate manner from his own creepy, weird self.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="118-Igor.png"/> A scientist’s research… It seems that world may secretly be known after all. Furthermore, that very research has been stolen and is now used by those with malicious intent… I wonder how this will change the approach you take toward your rehabilitation… <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="118-Igor.png"/> I believe I told you we would spare no expense in cooperating with you. Allow me to grant you a new power worthy of your current self.<br/>
<br/>
Note: the game developers may have forgotten to add new power.<br/>
<br/>
