<br/>
You’ve been back for like three hours and you’re already telling me when to go to bed.<br/>

I’m highly suspicious of the premise that there were a notable number of customers in Leblanc on any given day period, much less guys bringing dates there for <i>Valentine’s Day.</i><br/>

<br/>
I was in in lockup by myself for six straight weeks until yesterday. Those aren’t exactly optimal conditions from which immediately get up and start crushing puss, unless you count my accidentally stepping on Morgana this morning when I was getting out of bed, the same way Michael Scott burned his foot.<br/>

<br/>
Oh yeah, I’m <i>sure</i> they were all over you, buddy.<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruCasual.png"/> Ah, the store is still--<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The first time I brought a girl over here in even a platonic capacity you asked if she had a boyfriend and stared at her ass, you old lech. The less you know about my love life, the better. And don’t ask how I found out about that shit with Ann when I wasn’t in the room, okay? I have the power of clairvoyance, but it usually only shows me occasional minor plot-relevant scenes featuring people getting up to or becoming the victims of nefarious bullshit. Sometimes I know the people, sometimes I don’t. Sometimes they’re talking about me and my friends, sometimes they’re not. A lot of the time, it just showed me the same one dude, but I can’t figure out why because he was just kind of a one-note asshole barfing out waves of mostly pointless expository blather that there was probably a much less artificial and labored way to communicate, but he’s dead now so whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, stay away from my girlfriend. I’m not threatening you, I’m warning you. If you upset her you’ll wake up bound hand and foot just as the last specks of dirt being shoveled onto your face block your vision of the sky. <i>And then she’ll use the soil from where you were buried alive in a shallow, unmarked grave to grow some delicious vegetables.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Sojiro.png"/> Here, I’ll leave the store to you.<br/>
<br/>
Smart idea.<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, and you better leave too, cat. I’m probably not gonna get any tonight because you’ve already made my room smell like cat turds again, the least you can do is give us some privacy.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ignore him. He sucks.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-017.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruCasual.png"/> I am worried though. After all, it’s you we’re talking about.<br/>
<br/>
I’m… really not sure how to take that. It doesn’t quite sound like a compliment.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruCasual.png"/> Um… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-019.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruCasual.png"/> I actually made it myself…<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
If you think that now, wait until you take the wrapping paper off!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruCasual.png"/> ...I’m so glad. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-023.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruCasual.png"/> I was thinking I would have to mail it to you…<br/>
<br/>
I’m not sure they would have let me receive a large bundle of chocolate in solitary.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-025.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-026.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruCasual.png"/> My apologies. I didn’t mean it like that…<br/>
<br/>
Nah, it’s fine. I hid what I was doing on Christmas from you, after all, because I’m a massive coward who uses my perception of your weakness to rationalize not being emotionally open or honest about my problems.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruCasual.png"/> It seems I’ll be participating in the coffee chain project even while I’m at college. Starting in April, I’ll be on my way to becoming a full member of society… Am I going to be OK?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Seems like you’ve got a lot on your plate, but I’m sure you can handle it. <br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Protag.png"/> *nod*<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Protag.png"/> *nod*<br/>
<br/>
Maaku’s inherent qualities as a silent protagonist are really making this tender scene hilariously strange.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-033.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruCasual.png"/> I’ll be busy with work by then as well… so we… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It’s so great that we’ve spent all this time encouraging Haru, helping her make her own decisions and realize her goals, and there’s an option here where we can just tell her to throw her college plans and entire future away at the last minute so she can follow her boyfriend, who she won’t even be able to attend the same school as anyway because she will have already graduated, to bumfuck nowhere.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Protag.png"/> *nod*<br/>
<br/>
Long-distance relationship, huh? I’ve heard that those never work. People delude themselves into thinking it might… but it might work for us!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-HaruCasual.png"/> Truthfully, I spent all that time waiting for your release, so living a little further away is nothing… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-038.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-039.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And so, we spent a nice night with Haru. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-unsmith.gif" title=":unsmith:"/>
