<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Whisper.jpg"/> I didn’t expect him to commit suicide…<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Whisper.jpg"/> He’s a murderer. He deserved to die.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Murmur.jpg"/> We can finally breathe easy now. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Murmur.jpg"/> He killed himself huh? I guess we’ll never know his motivation. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> Don’t fall asleep until we reach our destination. ...Are you listening? <br/>
<br/>
I see we’re just skipping how Sae managed to extricate Maaku from the police station, okay.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Morgana.png"/> You weren’t paying attention? Well, I guess I can see how you’d be lost in thought right now. Anyway, we need to talk about how to get out of this situation.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> Futaba’s monitoring of Akechi’s phone has confirmed it… He did indeed have an ulterior motive.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ryuji.png"/> It’s on a completely different level than just that. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> Not only was he trying to frame us, but he was the true culprit behind the mental shutdowns… His offer to assist us was simply a plot to frame the Phantom Thieves… and kill Maaku-kun. If we go into Sis’ Palace as he suggests, we’ll likely be met by a large ambush of police forces. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yusuke.png"/> To think he would be this far gone… I know now what it means to feel a chill down my spine. Furthermore, he wishes to bring a police squad from reality into the Palace… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> If the eight of us can enter at once, it’s not inconceivable to think a larger group is possible. He may even be able to bring in vehicles or other special pieces of equipment. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Ann.png"/> So this really was just a setup to shift the blame onto us… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-MorganaAngry.png"/> He made us go after Okumura, then once we triggered the change of heart, he killed him… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ryuji.png"/> The whole time he was workin’ with Makoto’s sister, he was really just some homicidal maniac! C’mon, we gotta take that bastard Akechi down! Isn’t that recording we got enough proof to do it!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> No, Akechi is merely a tool. His orders come from elsewhere… The grand mastermind behind this all. An unimaginable fiend capable of arranging the murder of a suspect of a police station… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yusuke.png"/> Unless we find out who that is, we will continue being targeted even if we defeat Akechi… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Haru.png"/> But… what means do we have of learning his identity? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yusuke.png"/> We’ll have to make Akechi say it… though once we do, that mastermind will likely eliminate us. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> I think that will be the case eventually regardless of whether or not we learn his identity. The only reason it hasn’t happened yet is because we’re an easy target to blame for his crimes. If he realizes that’s no longer possible and abandons that plan, he may opt to kill us immediately. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ryuji.png"/> Dammit… So we don’t got a choice but to go with that bastard’s suggestion… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Ann.png"/> But if we go into the Palace as told, Maaku will get arrested and then murdered by Akechi… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-FutabaJacket.png"/> Palace… The Palace… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> ...Actually, there’s something I’d like to say regarding--<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-008.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Ann.png"/> Wh-What’s this all of a sudden!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-FutabaJacket.png"/> There’s a way… A way to get past Akechi And get the mastermind to lay off of us, all while learning his identity. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Haru.png"/> Really…!? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ryuji.png"/> You gotta be kidding me…! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-FutabaJacket.png"/> If he wants to kill Maaku, why not let him?<br/>
<br/>
Hey!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-FutabaJacket.png"/> That is, inside the Palace… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> Yes. We could have him kill the cognitive Maaku-kun, all while believing he killed the real one. <br/>
<br/>
Oh.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-FutabaJacket.png"/> Yeah, that’s it! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> It seems that’s our only option. Listen close, everyone. I have a plan for how we can carry this operation out… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-TV.jpg"/> However, the police intend on continuing this investigation until the case is fully solved. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Sojiro.png"/> Waiting upstairs. Go tell them to come on down. I’m gonna fetch him. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> Makoto told me everything. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-FutabaJacket.png"/> Eh, it’s ancient history now.<br/>
<br/>
“You only tried to revoke my adoptive father’s custody at a point when he was the only person alive who cared for me in any way, including myself! Water under the bridge!”<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ryuji.png"/> But man, that goddamn detective! <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ryuji.png"/> Hey, you big bastard!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Ann.png"/> How’ve you been? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Ann.png"/> You’re not floating...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> It truly is a relief to see your face. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Sojiro.png"/> Still, how’d you pull this off? Isn’t this guy considered dead? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> You weren’t told anything? I heard my sister brought him here though… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Sojiro.png"/> Yeah. She came over in a taxi, dumped him off, and told me to keep him safe. It was right after they announced he had “died” too. Almost gave me a heart attack. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> I didn’t have time to explain… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ryuji.png"/> Hey, shouldn’t we tell Boss what really happened? <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-019.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> What we did was make that enemy kill his fake in the Metaverse. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Sojiro.png"/> Enemy? Fake…? What’re you talking about…?<br/>
<br/>
Poor Sojiro has no goddamn clue what’s going on.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yusuke.png"/> The true culprit behind all these incidents set us up. Our goal here was to determine their identity. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Sojiro.png"/> True culprit…? I see… So you guys were going up against someone else. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> It was Goro Akechi. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> You knew beforehand that he was the traitor, didn’t you? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Ann.png"/> Akechi himself gave us the chance to strike back. He made one fatal mistake. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> Couldn’t you have just said from the beginning that Akechi was the real culprit?<br/>
<br/>
I didn’t <i>fucking remember.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> That wasn’t something we could simply bring up. We couldn’t have you suspect Akechi. Besides, neither you nor the other investigators would have believed something like that, would you?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> ...True. Akechi was credited with the arrest of the Phantom Thieves. Not even I would think he was the culprit… In other words, you left him alone on purpose… That was a bold move. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Sojiro.png"/> God, I can’t keep up with any of this stuff…<br/>
<br/>
Sojiro is basically my dad whenever we watch Westworld together. And also me.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Ann.png"/> He slipped up in regards to Morgana’s voice. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Ann.png"/> Yes. Morgana can talk.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Sojiro.png"/> Sorry, was that supposed to be a joke? <br/>
<br/>
I love that Sojiro just thinks we’re fucking with him.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Haru.png"/> Oh! Our apologies. That’s completely true. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-MorganaHappy.png"/> You surprised? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> Does that mean… he said something just now as well? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Ann.png"/> But you don’t understand him, do you? That’s how it was for all of us at first too. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-FutabaJacket.png"/> When you’re in the Metaverse, Mona talks like a normal person. Once you hear that and your brain realizes he can actually talk, you start to understand him in reality.<br/>
<br/>
Wait, what? She should be able to hear him! She’s been to a Palace, and Akechi had never heard Morgana before in the Metaverse! Which is it, game?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-FutabaJacket.png"/> ...It’s a change in cognition! Most likely!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Ann.png"/> Thanks to Akechi’s lame acting, we figured out something was up.<br/>
<br/>
Look who’s talking here.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ryuji.png"/> But we already saw him drop a mega hint about it waaay earlier.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-028.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-029.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Bahahahahahahah, oh this game’s really pretty dumb but I kind of love it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ryuji.png"/> ...That meant Akechi’d already been in the Metaverse by then! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Ann.png"/> And since he was lying to us about that, we assumed he had a hidden motive behind contacting us. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Morgana.png"/> It seemed odd upon further thought. His reaction to my pancake comment was an honest one, after all. <br/>
<br/>
I seriously cannot believe the major inciting event of the third act of this game revolves around an innocuous comment about pancakes.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Morgana.png"/> That said, we weren’t so naive to overlook something like that. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Haru.png"/> That’s why we asked Futaba-chan to wiretap his phone. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-032.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yusuke.png"/> Even that ace detective could never have imagined a program being installed so quickly. Futaba’s quirky nature proved to be a great help. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-FutabaJacket.png"/> After a few days of listening this confirmed a his betrayal. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Akechi.png"/> That would be the only way to arrest them, given their methods. I’ll deal with them after that. Let me see… We could say he stole the guard’s gun and committed suicide during his imprisonment… How about that? Public security questioning will occur on the first day… and with that room, my task will be simple. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Akechi.png"/> Yes, the guard will be one of ours. We’ll have to eliminate him after to destroy the evidence though… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-037.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Akechi.png"/> And thus, the dangerous criminal responsible for the mass mental shutdowns shall end his own life. When he does, you will become a great hero who saved Japan from evil. As will I, of course. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Haru.png"/> He’s no ace detective… Akechi is the perpetrator behind the mental shutdown crimes. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> On top of that, there’s someone else commanding Akechi… Someone with great authority… so great that they can order an assassination in a police station. That’s why we had to make a move before they did. <br/>
<br/>
The other Phantom Thieves nod. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Sojiro.png"/> I see… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> Can you elaborate on that in more detail? What exactly happened in my cognitive world? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Haru.png"/> We’re sorry for using you without your permission. Your Palace had all the conditions we needed….<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> First, we required a place inside the cognitive world that was the same as in reality. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-042.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-043.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Ann.png"/> That’s why nobody but the person who uses the Nav even realizes they’re in the Metaverse. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ryuji.png"/> Back with Kamoshida, we came in from the station without even noticin’… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ryuji.png"/> You totally can’t tell the difference if there ain’t any distortions around. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yusuke.png"/> We had already investigated Niijima-san’s Palace when Makoto brought this suggestion to us. <br/>
<br/>
...Ha! Putting the Palace off for weeks was all part of my master plan to give us more time to figure out this other master plan! ...No, not really.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-046.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-MorganaHappy.png"/> To be honest, I didn’t quite understand it, but I went along with it. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Morgana.png"/> Yeah, it’s good we have her heading up our operations. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yusuke.png"/> Makoto is normally so calm as well… but once her mind is set, she gets oddly impulsive. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> I did have a bit of a rivalry forming with Akechi… But I just couldn’t contain myself anymore once you became a target, Sis. The reason I joined the Phantom Thieves was to heal your heart, after all. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> My own achievements were all that mattered to me… I was desperate. I wasn’t myself at all. I’m sorry I couldn’t see that. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> That goes for the both of us. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Haru.png"/> We heard from Mako-chan that you were going to do the interrogation, Niijima-san. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> And regarding its location… I take it you used the data from my laptop?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> I’m sorry. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> *chuckle* Go on.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I really like these little doodles that show up for this scene. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> First, our clothes didn’t change when we were down in the interrogation room. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Ann.png"/> Once we heard that from Makoto, we secretly went to check it out without Akechi knowing. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> There was also one more thing we absolutely needed to make this work… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yusuke.png"/> Since he had yet to be caught though, there obviously wouldn’t be anyone in that room. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> They looked no different from actual living people. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ryuji.png"/> After that, we just had to work our way into the Palace like usual while keepin’ Akechi in the dark. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> However, it was then that we were met with a terrifying, unexpected police ambush. As a result, even though we managed to grab the Treasure, we couldn’t get it out of the Metaverse… <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> We had prepared an empty briefcase beforehand and merely acted like we were taking the Treasure. This was because we knew the police would be coming for us. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Ann.png"/> We made sure before the operation that the police would be waiting to ambush us. And just as expected, he totally took the bait. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> And I had been interrogating him with no knowledge of this. But, how did you lure Akechi into this… cognitive world’s interrogation room? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-FutabaJacket.png"/> All I needed were the coordinates. Hehehehehe… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-055.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Oh, <i>this</i> would drag on the conversation for too long. That’s the <i>only thing</i> that’s too much for right now. The rest of this conversation is just impeccably paced, I totally get it. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yusuke.png"/> It must have been truly hilarious for our leader who sat idly in the real world’s interrogation room. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> So that’s why you gave me your phone… I only took it because of what you told me. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yusuke.png"/> It’s a shame I didn’t have the opportunity to see that for myself. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> All I could do was try to handle all the messages that started coming to me on his phone. Huh… So in other words, I’ve been to the Metaverse, albeit for a brief moment. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yusuke.png"/> In our experience, there is little danger when someone enters their own Palace for so short a time. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Haru.png"/> That’s the other reason we had him give it to you. We needed you to listen to Alibaba, deceive the guard, and ultimately aid in his escape. By having you head back to the interrogation room, we could return you to the real world as well. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-FutabaJacket.png"/> I mean, I had to think of some way to keep you from running into Akechi mid-assassination. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> ...Astounding.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Gross.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Ann.png"/> I’m so glad Maaku was able to persuade you during the interrogation. Even though we knew about Akechi’s plan, we were pretty worried about that part. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> True. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> Without Sis on our side, Futaba’s plan and subsequent breakout would have never been possible. That persuasion was easily our greatest gamble. We couldn’t consult Sis beforehand. It was absolutely the make-or-break moment of the entire plan. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> Still, I’m surprised you could convince me in such a short time. Were you confident you could do it? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> Then it truly was a do or die situation? That’s crazy. Either way, I can’t believe you went for such a risky idea… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> If we could just tell you the true culprit’s plan, I knew you’d realize the bigger picture… Realize that Maaku-kun was telling the truth, and that there was a greater evil to pursue. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yusuke.png"/> As a result, we emerged victorious. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> Then the reason you kept this a secret from me was so you could catch the true culprit, correct? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> Yes. Plus, you had lost control of yourself at the time… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> This is stunning… All I can really do is laugh. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Sojiro.png"/> I’ve kinda figured out that you guys made Akechi kill a fake… But what did you do about the body? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> The police never even checked it. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> They had a coroner working to ensure Maaku-kun’s death was reported as a suicide. That coroner didn’t take one look at the scene, and just passed along a falsified death certificate.<br/>
<br/>
First off, how the hell do you know this? Second, I absolutely, unironically love that the plot fucking hinges on the massive political conspiracy being both too lazy and too stupid to A: actually make sure there’s a corpse for its chosen patsy and B: keep watch over the restaurant that serves as both my home and base of operations. It’s honestly pretty great that these morons are so blinded by greed and ego that they fail basic procedures to keep their evil asses from getting revealed and overthrown.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Sojiro.png"/> ...The bad guys have that much influence? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> Murder in a police station would be reckless otherwise. We also knew of a possible conspirator.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> Thanks to Futaba-chan’s messages and the guard’s demeanor, I eventually came to understand… And since the higher-ups at the police knew nothing of this, they were thrown into disarray. As a result, Maaku-kun’s suicide during imprisonment was reported on the news, just as Akechi planned. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Ann.png"/> And with that confusion, he was able to escape with Niijima-san’s help. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> I made sure nobody would check the morgue for his body, and thanks to that, nobody knows he survived.<br/>
<br/>
How did you do that?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/> Thinking back to the interrogation though… I can’t believe what they did to Maaku-kun. The callous use of violence and even drugs is utterly abnormal. If he had lost consciousness and hadn’t been able to tell Sis about the phone, he would’ve died… I’m… truly glad you made it back safe, Maaku-kun.<br/>
<br/>
Don’t get forward with me, Ma<i>cop</i>to. I have my sights set on Haru. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Haru.png"/> We made sure to live normal lives while he was being interrogated to avoid drawing any suspicion. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, so that’s why you were all “surprised” when you heard the news despite that making no sense. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Haru.png"/> Even with that, I couldn’t help but worry for him in my heart… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Ryuji.png"/> Well, I knew right away that our plan worked out. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yusuke.png"/> I wanted to believe… but considering what we were up against… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-MorganaHappy.png"/> Ryuji’s a bit on the dense and carefree side. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Ann.png"/> I had to be patient and avoid this place until things settled down. I finally feel relieved…<br/>
<br/>
They haven’t exactly “settled down” yet. It’s been like a day.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Yusuke.png"/> We knew he was alive, but… It was difficult to not worry until we could confirm it in person. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Sae.png"/> Now that I think about it, my interrogation was just a formality for the head commander. What a joke letting me interrogate someone who was meant to die. They just wanted to avoid backlash… Very well. From here forward, I will do my utmost to assist you. ...You saved me, after all. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Ann.png"/> That’s reassuring to hear. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Sojiro.png"/> I’ll do whatever I can to help too. Just let me know. Let’s take a break for now though. This old brain is pooped. Oh, and feel free to use the first floor when you guys want to get together to talk. You’ll need a hideout where you can be safe. Just say the word and I’ll close shop early. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Ann.png"/> Are you sure? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Sojiro.png"/> This guy can’t leave. Plus, you won’t make much progress if people can hear you from downstairs. It’s not like this place is the liveliest joint in town. It won’t be a huge loss for me.<br/>
<br/>
How on earth does Leblanc make money?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-FutabaJacket.png"/> Heheh. <br/>
<br/>
