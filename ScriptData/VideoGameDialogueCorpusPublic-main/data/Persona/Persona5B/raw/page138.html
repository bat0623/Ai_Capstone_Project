All right, it’s now or never. We’ve got to steal Sae’s heart and clear our names… but first, we have a lot of fucking around to do. A <i>lot</i>. We want to unlock the last of our Confidant requests before we head into Mementos so we can knock them out all at once. Unfortunately, Iwai has one, is our only remaining night Confidant we haven’t reached that point for, and is currently gated by Rank 5 Guts, the last unmaxed stat parameter for us. We need to get his and one other Mementos request, but it’s going to take a bit.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-TV.jpg"/> It’s believed that all of them have been caused by the Phantom Thieves. The public remains terrified of the cruel and inhumane acts the Phantom Thieves are committing. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-MorganaAngry.png"/> Dammit! What’s going on? None of that’s our fault! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Haughty.png"/> The only one who can rebuild this rotten world is… that man. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Haughty.png"/> You’re still blindly following the Phantom Thieves? They were nothing but a sweet, sinful trap. The Phantom Thieves played Robin Hood, but they committed those crimes just to please themselves. When they’re inevitably caught, it’ll be a poignant fall from grace, just like in the movies.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Old_Man_2.jpg"/> That Shido’s very competent. He worked his way up from the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly. More than anything, I can tell that he’s a good, upright, and honest man. I like him. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Boom_Box.jpg"/> Approval ratings remain low, and it seems that a dissolution of Parliament is inevitable… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Old_Man_3.jpg"/> I’m not surprised. Politicians do nothing for us. That’s the way it’s always been. <br/>

Around this point, this guy moves in and starts selling sweet potatoes that restore SP during the day. It’s quaint, but not that useful. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Rocker.jpg"/> C’mon… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Cop.jpg"/> We’ve had to tighten city security because of the Phantom Thieves case. Pack your things and be on your way. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Protestor.jpg"/> Now that the Phantom Thieves have been covered by shadows, the world will fall into darkness… Sun God, the people are scared! Now is the time for you to shed your light on the path… <br/>
<br/>
And those weird religious protesters, too!? What’s happening!?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Man_7.jpg"/> His aura of popularity was on at full blast. He kinda had the same smell as you…<br/>
<br/>
What? Gross.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Man_5.jpg"/> ...Who’d you go with? A girl? You did, didn’t you? <br/>
<br/>
Man, “Veteran Pick-up Artist” is getting pretty desperate.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Man_7.jpg"/> Of course, I went with a girl. She’s a fan of Akechi, so… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Woman_8.jpg"/> I’m just glad the company survived in one piece—and that my family’s got plenty in our savings. By the by, how’s your guy? Oh, I’m sorry—should I not ask? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Woman_9.jpg"/> Well, actually, because he helped with the case so much, they promoted him to CEO. Ohoho… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Woman_6.jpg"/> What are you saying? Did something happen with your boyfriend? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Woman_7.jpg"/> I told him my real age and apologized. And then he said, “No way”… I broke up with him! I guess being honest really isn’t worth it!<br/>
<br/>
A moral we can all get behind. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-033.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Fishy_Hawker.jpg"/> I figured out where the Phantom Thieves’ hideout is. I can sell you the info for a cheap price. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Fishy_Hawker.jpg"/> Whoa! Wait a sec, you involved with the investigation or something!? ...Heh, yeah right. A kid like you? I don’t even care. Just get outta here. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Taxi_Driver_1.jpg"/> No way, we’d just get killed. The police can handle it, so let’s leave this to the pros. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Bickle.jpg"/> Hey, we can pick up more fares near those government agencies if they’re gonna get busy. But I’m not sure they can catch the Phantom Thieves. They can just make you go brain dead, easy. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Promoter.jpg"/> Amazingly, we’ve gotten five times more contract sign-ups this autumn than we did last year! That’s because people know that Wanna-B-Alert will protect you when evil suddenly strikes! To celebrate our high contract numbers with our customers, we’re giving away Wanna-Wanna-kun dolls! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Winger.jpg"/> It also seems suspicious though. Doesn’t this situation kind of feel like it was all set up? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Lawyer.jpg"/> It’s probably the police sending a message. “This is what happens when you cross the authorities.” This whole thing even impacted the government. I doubt the police are looking forward to Christmas. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Office_Worker.jpg"/> The Phantom Thieves are all over the news. People on the internet are always talking about them. If I won that 30 million yen reward, I’d reserve the entire cafe and have a humongous party! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Maid.jpg"/> Yeah, yeah. We’ll be waiting to welcome your arrival… <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Man_3.jpg"/> No way. It’d never work. Did you forget? Guys like us make for some annoying enemies, but we’re pretty useless allies. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Nerd.jpg"/> You know what? That does sound like us, huh? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Woman_7.jpg"/> Wha…? But we just signed the contract… You know… I never thought I’d say this, but I… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Busy_Young_Man.jpg"/> D-Don’t worry! I borrowed 1 millin yen from my parents… The stock market’s small-time! I’ll win it big on the foreign exchange market! Celebrolution! <br/>
<br/>
DUMP HIM<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Shinya.png"/> But my mom told them that it was the kid’s own fault for having his money taken… She just told them to leave without hearing what they had to say. Something’s wrong… with my mom. The other day she called my school to complain that the cost of lunch is too high. I begged her not to do it, but she said it’s for my own good… I doubt it was really ‘cause of me though. Once everyone finds out, I’m gonna get made fun of again… But… She told me that once you stop fighting, you lose. And that those who complain, win. My mom was never like this before… She never used to care about stuff like winning or losing… <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Shinya_s_Mother.jpg"/> Constantly talking back to me… I knew someone new must have come into the picture. So? Are you the one who’s been such a bad influence on my Shinya? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Shinya_s_Mother.jpg"/> Yes. Children should obey their parents. But he doesn’t! I want my obedient Shinya back! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Shinya.png"/> S-Stop it…! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Shinya_s_Mother.jpg"/> Will you take responsibility if my Shinya turns into a juvenile delinquent? All that time and money I spent on him, wasted! What are you going to do about THAT, huh? <br/>
<br/>
Jeez lady, that’s an awful way to talk about your son.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Shinya_s_Mother.jpg"/> Hamiru-san, hm? I’m going to remember you. You’re a high schooler, right? Hm, I may just have to tell your school… ...One of their students is stalking my son. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This is supposed to be some massive threat but all I can think about here is that this scene is completely fucked because I’m doing it on a Sunday and am thus not in my uniform. What is she gonna do, call every high school in Tokyo? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Shinya.png"/> Stop it… Mom… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Shinya_s_Mother.jpg"/> Come on, Shinya, we’re going home! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Shinya_s_Mother.jpg"/> He’s my son. I can do whatever I want to him! If you keep meddling with him, I’m going to call the police! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Shinya_s_Mother.jpg"/> ...Fine. Just know this: I don’t intend to lose. Now let’s go! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Shinya.png"/> But… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Shinya_s_Mother.jpg"/> Shinya…? You ARE Shinya, aren’t you!? <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Shinya.png"/> Crap, I gotta go… I don’t like the person my mom’s turned into. She won’t listen to anything I say… That’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about today… Um, do you think the Phantom Thieves can turn my mom back into her old self…? <br/>
<br/>
Oh shit!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Protag.png"/> <i>Shinya appears to be on the verge of tears...</i><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Shinya.png"/> Please tell the Phantom Thieves… To change my mom back… to the way she used to be… <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
And we meet immediately! Sure, why not?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-RyujiCasual.png"/> And we’re gonna do it by changin’ his mom’s heart? ...I bet that was a real tough decision to make.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, we already changed Hifumi’s mom’s heart, and this time we actually have permission, even if it was given to us by a grade schooler.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-AnnJacket.png"/> I mean, he’s only in elementary school, right? This is a lot for a little kid to be dealing with… <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-MakotoCasual.png"/> You’re right… We should try to help him as soon as possible. As for the calling card, let’s have him deliver it himself. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Morgana.png"/> I guess this counts as a unanimous decision? <br/>
<br/>
So, we don’t actually have the request yet. Because we’re going to have Shinya hand-deliver the calling card, we need to wait until we next meet him to get the request. <br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-FutabaChat.jpg"/> Oh yeah! You said you saw a masked guy, right? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-HaruChat.jpg"/> I wanted to ask about that too. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-FutabaChat.jpg"/> Did you really see him? That masked guy’s gotta be the true culprit, right?<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-GoroChat.jpg"/> If this so-called true culprit is acting alone, then there can be no mistake about it.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-FutabaChat.jpg"/> I see. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-YusukeChat.jpg"/> The next question is, who is that masked man? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-GoroChat.jpg"/> Unfortunately, I do not know that much.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-FutabaChat.jpg"/> Ugh, you’re useless. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-GoroChat.jpg"/> That is quite harsh. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-FutabaChat.jpg"/> Aw, you’re making me blush.<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-AnnChat.png"/> That wasn’t a compliment...<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-GoroChat.jpg"/> At this point, I have yet to even grasp any clues.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Morgana.png"/> He doesn’t have any clues, but he’s confident enough to say he can definitely catch the guy… No wonder he’s a star detective. Even the way he talks about these things is different from us. <br/>

So, I actually forgot to include the last time I went to Shady Commodities, but all I did that time was unlock the last tier of items from the previous set of purchases and buy some more transmutation catalysts. There’s a bunch of new, incredibly overpriced items, too. The Roland Medal is the big new thing, increasing all stats by +5, but we’re really just here to show that it exists, so we buy some washable armor and bounce. We probably won’t ever even end up laundering it. <br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Woman_7.jpg"/> About that… I think I would really rather stick to singing. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-Office_Worker_3.jpg"/> This is just business as usual for the industry. Besides, you need to understand something… In this world, it’s not enough to just sing. You need to be a star. You need to be entertaining. Got it?<br/>
<br/>
Can we change this dude’s heart, please?<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-Grade_Schooler_2.jpg"/> What!? That sucks… All that time you spent studying hard is just gone! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-Grade_Schooler_1.jpg"/> I hate it when our parents just make us study all the time! I’ll get them back for this… I’ll get back all the games and manga they threw out! <br/>
<br/>
Harsh.<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-076.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="123-Souse.jpg"/> Offisherrrrr! I got ‘em! I caaaaaught a Phantom Thief!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Cop.jpg"/> OK, quiet down, sir. Sorry about this. Now let go of him, and we’ll get you home. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="124-077.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="123-Souse.jpg"/> Offisher! I believe I jus’ won th’ thirsty jillion yen rewarrrd. I caught… muh Phantom Thief.<br/>
<br/>
“Thirsty jillion” makes me fucking lose it, it’s so dumb.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Cop.jpg"/> OK, OK. Who are you talking to? There’s no one over there.<br/>
<br/>
GHOST<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="125-078.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="123-Souse.jpg"/> Hmm? Wha’ are you sayin’? Are you shayin’ yer not a Phantom Thief? Can’t fool meee! Yer a Phantom Thief! <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Cop.jpg"/> OK, stop right there. Let go of him and head on home, OK? <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="126-079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="127-College_Student_1.jpg"/> Our club’s gonna bag that reward! Every one of us should be diggin’ up on [sic] dirt on the Phantom Thieves!<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="128-College_Student_2.jpg"/> Well, hold on now. We don’t want to put ourselves in any danger. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="127-College_Student_1.jpg"/> Relax, buuuddy! We’re unstoppable! <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="129-080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="130-Office_Worker_2.jpg"/> Those who are swayed by fads are fools. The people of this country will never learn. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="131-Office_Worker_4.jpg"/> Is this really what we should be focusing on? Aren’t the elections at the end of the year? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="130-Office_Worker_2.jpg"/> Yes, and the ruling party finally split up. Although, it’s too late, considering the approval rating. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="132-081.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-Office_Worker_3.jpg"/> Our company’s been hurting financially too after investing in Phantom Thieves related stuff. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="130-Office_Worker_2.jpg"/> We’re always the ones getting the short end of the stick. I’ve had enough of this. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-Office_Worker_3.jpg"/> Politicians are also to blame. They’ve been ignoring that dangerous group for a long time. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="133-082.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="134-Drunk_Regular.jpg"/> Oh, it’s you. Your Japanese has gotten pretty decent. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="135-Foreign_Barker.jpg"/> I want to get better at speaking to customers. Communication is key. That’s why I started following current events more on the news. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="136-083.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="137-Rural_Young_Man.jpg"/> Does that mean ya finally wanna come back home to the country? <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="138-Adorable_Woman.jpg"/> No. I worked too hard to get here just to leave now. Just gotta hope they’re caught soon. <br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="137-Rural_Young_Man.jpg"/> I’ll keep ya safe. We’re all real worried ‘bout ya, y’know.<br/>
<br/>
Man, this poor idiot. She’s not gonna fuck you, dude.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="139-084.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
