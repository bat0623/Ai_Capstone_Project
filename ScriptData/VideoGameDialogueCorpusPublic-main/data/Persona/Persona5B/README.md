# Persona 5

The source only provides a sample, first because some of the dialogue is in untranscribed images, but also because it only shows one path through each dialogue tree.

## Gender Coding

Morgana the anthropomorphic cat has a female voice actor in cat form, but a male voice actor in human form, and is referred to throughout the wiki as 'he', so I've coded him as male.

-----
The various 'office worker' characters overheard in the mornings are difficult to place, as you don't see who is talking. The source gives them gender by naming them after characters from the TV show "The Office", but these aren't reliable indicators of gender. In some cases they have voiced barks, and/or their names match characters we see elsewhere in the game (e.g. Young Office Worker). Where such clues are not present, I've coded as neutral.  

Bael is the transformed demon form of Shadow Kaneshiro, who is the Shadow Self of Junya Kaneshiro. I have coded the shadow selves as different from the originals, but in this case Bael as an alias of the Shadow Kaneshiro (since they are the same entity). Someone with a better idea of the persona metaphysics might revisit this. Likewise Baphomet is the transformed demon form of Shadow Fukurai. 

Many of the characters have multiple aliases in-game (like Sadayo Kawakami, who goes by 'Becky' for her second job). I've tried to capture these as much as possible. This is particularly difficult with generics ("Boy 1", "Young Office Worker" etc.) - wherever possible I've tried to fix issues with aliases, but because the source seems to group distinct people together, and the game calls individual people by multiple aliases, this is very likely to be imperfect. 

"Chatter", "Whisper" and "Murmur" are often used for unattributed overheard dialogue, but frequently there are attributions in the game but not the source. I've addressed as many of these as possible with aliases (the same is true for "TV"). Some of these are best guesses where I couldn't track them down with videos (for instance, the "Tabloid Show Host" (aka "Host") is often followed by "Chatter", and instances I've been able to find are all cases where it's his "Female Assistant" (sometimes called "Female Host", but that causes confusion with the shopping channel), so I've assumed that's a pattern.) 

The NPCs use "he" to refer to the ClerkBot and its uniform has male signifiers (e.g. the tie/suit). I've coded male accordingly. Since ChiefBot has a similar character model (just palette swapped) I've coded it as male too. 

"Hacker" is the source file author chatting to themself. Coded as "action" so it's disregarded. There are other digressions dealt with similarly. 

"Haughty Regular" is sometimes called "Pompous Male Customer" in the game itself, but seems to be the same person. 

"Shadow Honyo" is the shadow version of "Chief". 

"Commentator" is unvoiced and unseen; coded as neutral. "Trainer" starts out being called "Wrinky Old Man", so I've coded as male. 

The unseen "Demon" refers to itself as "King Yama", so coding as male. Could be revisited. 

"System Voice" is unvoiced, so coded as neutral. 

"Octavius" is an octopus character in one of the video games the protagonist plays. It is unvoiced and absent other clues, I've coded as neutral (although there's a case to be made for 'male' given the name)

"Phone" are best guesses from context. When applying for the convenience store job, when speaking to the manager the subtitles say "male voice", and the manager is a man. I've worked from that pattern to add aliases where possible. 

"Robot Clerks" is a generic - there are multiple identical NPCs in this palace. Coded neutral. 

Alibaba is an in-game alias for Futaba, however before this is revealed the other characters treat Alibaba as a male character (and presumably the player assumes they are male too). I have only changed 'Alibaba' to 'Futaba' where it's obvious to the characters (and player) who she is (i.e. where the pronouns change). I've coded Alibaba as male (and Futaba as female) accordingly. 

At one point "Souse" talks as if he's Kamoshida's mother, but this is in keeping with his general drunken ramblings (and the burly officer repeatedly refers to him as a man.)

"Igor" spends most of the game not really being Igor - he's a fake one (actually "Yaldaboath"). I've left these lines as coded in the source but the attributions could be revisited.
