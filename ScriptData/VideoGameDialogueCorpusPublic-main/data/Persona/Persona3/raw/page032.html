		<b>Entry Twenty-Seven: September 5th, 2009</b><br/><br/>
<b>Mood:</b> <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-smithicide.gif"/> Drained<br/>
<b>Music:</b> The usual post-Ordeal soundtrack - nada<br/>
<br/>
Y'know, being alive is always so nice after an Ordeal. You don't really notice small things like the smell of the night air until after you've nearly been eaten by a 10-foot-tall electrical monstrosity, y'know?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-Persona3-28-001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Speaking of things that smell, that guy Mutatsu needs to cut the drinking down a little.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Persona3-28-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: Didn't Dad tell you not to do that, ehhh?</i><br/>
<br/>
Wait, what? Dad?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Persona3-28-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
No, I was asking yo--ah, forget it, you fucking boozehound.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Persona3-28-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: I thought you got in an accident or somethin'...don't make me worry like that. What the hell were ya doin' thish late?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Persona3-28-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: Damn...all this time, I thought you were...I guess my eyesight is getting bad after all.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Persona3-28-016.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Persona3-28-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This guy really needs to go to AA or something.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Persona3-28-018.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Persona3-28-019.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Persona3-28-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Or, hell, I'm sure they sell Dis-Drunk over at the pharmacy. It's probably next to Dis-Child, that birth control medication.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Persona3-28-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: I wonder if they felt the same way I did as I waited for you earlier...my wife and son, it's been four years since they left...I used to stay out past midnight, and when I got home, my wife and I would get into a big argument. Now when I go home, I don't know what do do with myself, so I just come here and drink every night.</i><br/>
<br/>
I told him I thought he was running away from his problems, harsh as it might be.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Persona3-28-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: I get drunk to avoid facing my problems. So yeah, I guess you could say I'm runnin' away. ...She hasn't called me or sent me a letter since then. She must've gotten over me. Who knows where they are, or if they even wanna see me...aw, forget it. It's too much of a hassle anyway.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Persona3-28-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I headed back to the dorm...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Persona3-28-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and school seemed to fly by the next day. After school, I found myself zoning out as I waited for everyone to gather in the command room.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Persona3-28-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Nah, on second thought, I better stay put...the operation's tonight. Now that I think about it...we're fighting to protect her, too. Dude, that so rocks! Maybe we really are, like, heroes...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Persona3-28-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Junpei was acting like a little kid...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Persona3-28-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...but suddenly, a familiar voice told him to freeze.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Persona3-28-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That night, at the Dark Hour...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Persona3-28-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...Fuuka was hard at work searching for the next Shadow.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Persona3-28-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: It's near Paulownia Mall, I think...<br/>
Mitsuru: You think...?<br/>
Fuuka: For some reason, I can't quite pinpoint its location...but I'm trying to narrow it down.<br/>
Akihiko: Is that its power?<br/>
Fuuka: I don't know.<br/>
Shinjiro: We have enough to go on...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Persona3-28-060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We hadn't seen Junpei since that morning - he wasn't there when we gathered to start the operation, so we had sent Ken to look for him.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Persona3-28-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ken: His backpack isn't here, so I don't think he's been home yet.<br/>
Yukari: That idiot...he knows tonight's the night!<br/>
Fuuka: I don't sense him anywhere nearby...should I take more time to look, just in case?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Persona3-28-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ikutsuki: You're all young; sometimes you just get in one of those moods. Anyway, we should focus on the task at hand. <br/>
Shinjiro: ...<br/>
Mitsuru: We can't afford to waste any more time. Let's go.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Persona3-28-071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I didn't think he had...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Persona3-28-073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Shinjiro and I joined the others on the way to the mall. Have I mentioned that going places during the Dark Hour sucks? It really does. My feet STILL hurt from all that walking.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Persona3-28-074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Another creepy thing about the Dark Hour: all the water turns to blood. That's ALL the water, even what you couldn't see during the day.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Persona3-28-075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
When we arrived, Fuuka scanned the area for the Shadow.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Persona3-28-076.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: Alright, let's split up and search for it. There's no time to lose; hurry!<br/>
Fuuka: Wait! Please, give me a moment! This is my responsibility...!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Persona3-28-080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: Tell me, Lucia, what is this thing that deceives me...? Hear the wind's answer in your ear...touch the earth's answer with your fingertips...taste the water's answer on your lips...<br/>
Akihiko: Hey, is she okay?<br/>
Mitsuru: Don't break her concentration....</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Persona3-28-087.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: Some kind of...webbing?<br/>
Aigis: Perhaps it has something to do with the old power cables underground. They were just left there when the island's construction was completed.<br/>
Mitsuru: Power cables?<br/>
Aigis: Yes, they run underground in many directions, like a web.<br/>
Akihiko: And they're interfering with her ability?<br/>
Fuuka: ...Thank you, Aigis, I understand now.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Persona3-28-095.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Persona3-28-096.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: They what?! So...it's underneath this whole area?!<br/>
Akihiko: ...Now it all makes sense.<br/>
Ken: H-how are we supposed to beat something like that?!<br/>
Shinjiro: Tch...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Persona3-28-102.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Back at the dorm...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Persona3-28-103.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...Junpei was having his own problems.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Persona3-28-104.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: This isn't funny...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Persona3-28-106.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Persona3-28-107.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I have to admit that I wasn't surprised at all by this.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chidori: I have some new orders for you to give to your friends...surely you have the capacity to communicate with them.<br/>
Junpei: Me? Give orders?<br/>
Chidori: If you do as I say...you won't be harmed.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Persona3-28-112.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Persona3-28-113.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: You want me to cancel the mission? ...You're not one of "them", are you?<br/>
Chidori: Quit wasting time.<br/>
Junpei: ...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Persona3-28-118.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Back at the mall, we were trying to figure out how to deal with the Shadow possessing the electrical wires.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Persona3-28-119.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: Just like that one, this Shadow must have its own body. Let me see if I can find it...<br/>
Akihiko: Even if we know where it is, we might not be able to get to it...<br/>
Aigis: There may still be a way to reach the structure that the cables feed into.<br/>
Shinjiro: We'll see.<br/>
Yukari: Fuuka...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Persona3-28-126.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: It's close by...in this mall!<br/>
Yukari: In here?!<br/>
Fuuka: It's inside a small chamber underground. It's rectangular, so I assume it's man-made.<br/>
Ken: Is it some sort of room...?<br/>
Shinjiro: Wait a minute...I overheard the manager of Escapade saying that the power's been acting up lately.<br/>
Yukari: That's no surprise...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Persona3-28-136.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: That's it!<br/>
Mitsuru: Good job, Yamagishi.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Persona3-28-140.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I decided to bring Akihiko, Shinjiro, and Yukari along for this mission...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Persona3-28-141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and once they were ready to go, we were off.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7613517802541619702&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boss - Hermit</a> (<i>Hermit is one of the easier Ordeal bosses - he can zap the shit out of everyone with electricity, but not much else, and single-element bosses are easily cockblocked by Minato and his Persona-switching.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Persona3-28-142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It wasn't too tough to defeat the large Shadow.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: Oh, and also...I think I've found Junpei. He's back at the dorm, but something seems strange. The Chairman's there too, so he should be okay, but let's hurry just in case.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Persona3-28-147.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Back at the dorm...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Persona3-28-148.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Persona3-28-149.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Medea?<br/>
Chidori: ...My friend.<br/>
Junpei: Chidori...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Persona3-28-153.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chidori: Is it worth your life? Dying is what people fear most...isn't it?<br/>
Junpei: Well, I've never actually given anyone orders before...they wouldn't listen to me anyway.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Persona3-28-159.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chidori: So you were lying earlier? Why? ...I don't understand.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Persona3-28-163.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Us meeting, your wound, the picture...were you just setting me up? Now that I think about it, that cut healed pretty quickly...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Persona3-28-166.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chidori: That was...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Persona3-28-167.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Right about then, we burst into the room.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Persona3-28-169.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
When Chidori saw us, she drew an Evoker and brought it up under her chin.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Persona3-28-170.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chidori: Medea, come...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Persona3-28-172.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Persona3-28-173.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Before she could pull the trigger, though, Junpei broke free and forced her to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Persona3-28-174.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Persona3-28-175.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
As if things weren't chaotic enough, Ikutsuki decided to show up.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Persona3-28-176.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Akihiko did the smart thing and took Chidori's Evoker before she could do anything with it, thank God.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Persona3-28-177.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: I...I didn't sense her up until this very moment...this is my only power, and yet...<br/>
Ikutuski: If even Fuuka couldn't sense her, then she must have some sort of power to conceal her presence. I didn't have the slightest clue she was here...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Persona3-28-181.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Mitsuru tried to interrogate her right away...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Persona3-28-182.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...but Chidori would have none of it.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Ch-Chidori?!<br/>
Chidori: M-Medea, I'm...<br/>
Mitsuru: Clearly, she's emotionally unstable. We'll let her rest and save our questions for later.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Persona3-28-188.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And that's how the night ended. I wish those Strega guys would just give it up already...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Persona3-28-191.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Persona3-28-192.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...but they seem pretty desperate, so it looks like it'll be either them or us.<br/>
<br/>
(<i>Attack Fallen is great for Ken, since his main attack does a huge amount of bonus damage to enemies that are down.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Persona3-28-193.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I don't wanna think about it too much now, though. I'm just gonna go to bed...I'll see you guys later.<br/>
