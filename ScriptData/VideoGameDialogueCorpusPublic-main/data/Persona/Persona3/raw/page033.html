		<b>Entry Twenty-Eight: September 13, 2009</b><br/><br/>
School's back in full swing now, and all things considered it's not that bad. I missed hanging out with everyone over summer break, for one, and for two...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-Persona3-29-001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...high school's not exactly hard anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Persona3-28-199.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Anyway, current events in the life of Minato. Sunday morning, I had a vision of Mitsuru and the others trying to interrogate Chidori at the hospital.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Persona3-28-200.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: What kind of organization is Strega? Are there others besides you three?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Persona3-28-203.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, Junpei burst into the room.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Persona3-28-206.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: Uh...sorry. He wouldn't stop bugging me about this place.<br/>
Junpei: How are you feeling? Seems like you've calmed down.<br/>
Mitsuru: She certainly has. In fact, she won't say a word. Maybe we should confiscate her sketchbook, too...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Persona3-28-211.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: That won't make her talk!<br/>
Mitsuru: I'm not so sure about that. She was quite upset when we took her Evoker. Speaking of which...where did you get that?<br/>
Chidori: Medea...give it back to me! I want her back!!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Persona3-28-218.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: Then what am I supposed to do?! ...I'll have someone else try next time.<br/>
Akihiko: Yukari, call a nurse. We're done for today. I'll inform Ikutsuki-san of the difficulties we're having.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Persona3-28-223.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Persona3-28-224.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Chidori...what happened to you?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Persona3-29-002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
After that vision, I went to hang out with the sick kid again. I'm glad whatever he's got isn't contagious, believe me.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Persona3-29-004.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Persona3-29-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: Thank you for coming...it's better when I'm not alone. Why do I have to face this alone? ...Other people don't have to deal with this sickness.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Persona3-29-008.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Persona3-29-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I know he's dying and all, and I don't meant to be disrespectful, but most of what this guy says could easily fit in an Evanescence album.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Persona3-29-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I told him that he wasn't the only one, though I knew it wouldn't be much consolation.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Persona3-29-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: ...But so what? That has nothing to do with my plight here in this bed. Where is there meaning in any of this?!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Persona3-29-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: I wish I could run away...but if my body was capable of that, I wouldn't be here anyway. No matter what I do, my body is there to remind me...I'm going to die.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Persona3-29-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: Please don't leave...just yet...when I'm alone it feels like it could end at any second.</i><br/>
<br/>
I told him that he doesn't need to worry...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Persona3-29-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...though I admit, I'm afraid of death too.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Persona3-29-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That's why I get so nervous before the full moon, y'know?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Persona3-29-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Either way, just talking to Akinari seemed to help him feel better.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Persona3-29-029.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Persona3-29-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That's really the best I can hope for...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Persona3-29-031.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Persona3-29-032.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Persona3-29-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...sad as that may be. I went back home after hanging out with Akinari...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Persona3-29-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and went to Escapade that evening, where I ran into Mutatsu.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Persona3-29-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: Anyway, I'm sober today...so just sit down and listen to what this old monk has to say. All I gotta do is look all serious and recite the sutras, and I can make easy money; at least, that's what I thought. So I begged to take over my parents' temple. But every day is the anniversary of someone's death! I'm workin' 24/7, as if my temple was a convenience store...</i><br/>
<br/>
Well, "poor men know no leisure"...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Persona3-29-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: It varies, of course, but an offering can sometimes be as much as a salary man's year-end bonus. But as you can see, I'm too busy. I gotta push this old body of mine to the limit. Maybe I should think of somethin' else to do with my life. I can't keep this up for much longer...I've been drinkin' too much lately...makin' a fool of myself like I did the other day. A person should know when enough is enough.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Persona3-29-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: We never filed for divorce, and since I own the temple, we could all live there. I think it's a pretty good idea. I could retire and enjoy life for once. Whaddya think?</i><br/>
<br/>
I wasn't sure what exactly he meant...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Persona3-29-059.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Persona3-29-060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: First, I gotta find out where they are. I'll hire a detective. I don't care how much it costs. And when I see 'em, first think I'm gonna do is tell 'em I'm sorry...from the bottom of my heart. I'm gonna be concentratin' on this, so...I probably won't be seein' ya anytime soon...I-I've had enough of dealing with a punk like you, anyways! G-Good riddance!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Persona3-29-066.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Persona3-29-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The old guy sounds like he's going to miss hanging out.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Persona3-29-068.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Persona3-29-069.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Persona3-29-070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I hope things work out for him, too.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Persona3-29-079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day was pretty uneventful; I spent it trying to become just a little bit more of a badass by watching old Happy Days reruns and acting like the Fonz. I've stopped studying at night because, well, there's nothing left to study; maybe I went a bit overboard over summer break.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Persona3-29-080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
On Tuesday, I had a vision of Mitsuru and the others still trying to coax Chidori into talking.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Persona3-29-081.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: By refusing to speak, you're only hurting yourself. We aren't keeping you here because we hate you; we just want to avoid unnecessary confrontation.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Persona3-29-084.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Junpei burst in again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Persona3-29-085.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Did she say anything? Can I just talk to her?<br/>
Mitsuru: Iori...it seems like you're letting your emotions get the best of you. Is everything okay?<br/>
Junpei: Well...not exactly...I know she attacked me, but...I can't stop thinking about her!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Persona3-29-093.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: ...You okay? I'm glad they let you keep your sketchbook. You really do like to draw, huh...?<br/>
Chidori: ...it doesn't matter.<br/>
Fuuka: She spoke...<br/>
Chidori: No one else but me can understand my pictures...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Persona3-29-101.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
As Chidori moved her hand, Junpei noticed that there was another deep wound in it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Persona3-29-102.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Why are you bleeding?!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Persona3-29-104.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akihiko: I thought I had removed all the sharp objects in here...<br/>
Mitsuru: Apparently, we can't leave her unattended for even one moment. But fortunately, she heals at an astounding rate.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Persona3-29-108.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Then, at the station...you did that to yourself?!<br/>
Chidori: ...I never asked for your help. You were the one who misunderstood.<br/>
Junpei: Well, I want you to stop. You can't be doing that...it's not right...and I won't let you!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Persona3-29-116.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: Alright, let's go, Junpei-kun.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Persona3-29-118.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Mitsuru and Akihiko kept at it all afternoon...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Persona3-29-126.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day was pretty nondescript, but at least I finally started feeling like the demonslaying asskicker I am.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Persona3-29-203.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
All in all, I'm feeling pretty well rounded these days.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Persona3-29-127.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The day after that, Junpei and the others were at it again with Chidori.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Persona3-29-128.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: C'mon, cheer up...I brought you a new sketchbook. I thought your old one might be getting full.<br/>
Chidori: ...That wasn't necessary, Junpei.<br/>
Junpei: Heheh, you said my name...i was worried I'd never hear that again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Persona3-29-134.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: She finally started talking, but nothing useful yet.<br/>
Akihiko: Well, that's a start. So why are YOU here?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Persona3-29-139.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, Chidori seemed to start choking on something.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Persona3-29-142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The culprit appeared only briefly, but there was little doubt as to what it was...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Persona3-29-144.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Shinjiro quickly ran up and gave Chihiro some pills.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Persona3-29-146.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Chidori!<br/>
Shinjiro: Relax...it happens.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Persona3-29-149.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Persona3-29-150.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: Supressants...? You know about Strega?<br/>
Shinjiro: You'd be surprised what you can learn on the streets. I'll give the doc the right pills. The rest is up to you...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Persona3-29-155.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Shinjiro took off, and Akihiko went after him.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Persona3-29-158.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Th-thank God...! I thought you might be...<br/>
Chidori: Why do you look so scared? Death is nothing to be afraid of...<br/>
Junpei: What are you saying...?<br/>
Chidori: Dying just means you don't wake up anymore...that's all.<br/>
Junpei: Wh-what?! You don't really mean that, do you?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Persona3-29-165.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chidori: Junpei...<br/>
Junpei: Just because you're not afraid doesn't mean no one else is...did you ever think about how I might feel?!<br/>
Chidori: Haha...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Persona3-29-170.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Ha...look who's talkin'...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Persona3-29-172.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Akihiko caught up to Shinjiro at Port Island Station.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Persona3-29-173.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akihiko: Why did you have those pills?! I've heard about those...they're taken to suppress a Persona when the user can't control it. But the side-effects...you're not taking them, are you?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Persona3-29-179.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akihiko: Answer me!<br/>
Shinjiro: I don't owe you anything.<br/>
Akihiko: Tch...the same as always.<br/>
Shinjiro: Save it. I've heard it all before. You think I'm wasting my power...but you're just too thickheaded. I'm tired of your damn preaching.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Persona3-29-186.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
All of a sudden, Akihiko slugged Shinjiro in the face.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Persona3-29-187.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akihiko: You know the reason...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Persona3-29-189.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Persona3-29-190.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Shinjiro: ...<br/>
Akihiko: That's why I try so hard...we promised, remember? To become strong enough to do what we think is right...so why the drugs? Why didn't you come talk to me?<br/>
Shinjiro: I'm back in the fight now...so let it go.<br/>
Akihiko: ...and the side effects?</i><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Persona3-29-201.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Persona3-29-202.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Shinjiro: It's something only I can do.<br/>
Akihiko: Like what?<br/>
Shinjiro: ...Listen, don't worry about me. Just do what you think is right.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Persona3-29-208.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I went to see Chihiro that afternoon, since we hadn't talked in awhile...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Persona3-29-209.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Persona3-29-211.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and that evening, I got the standard call from Elizabeth.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-Persona3-29-212.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Mitsuru told me that she was going to let Junpei handle Chidori for now, so she, Akihiko, and Fuuka would be around after school again to go to Tartarus.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Persona3-29-238.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day, I hung out with Bebe after school.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Persona3-29-239.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Bebe: I am worried about my uncle...'ow can I convince 'im to let me stay 'ere?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-Persona3-29-245.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I doubted the validity of that plan.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Bebe: ...Oh! Maybe if we go to ze Sweet Shop and 'ave a snack, I can come up wiz a plan! Shall we?!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Persona3-29-255.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
So that's just what we did.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Bebe: I will be disappointed if I 'ave to return to my country! I want to stay 'ere in Nihon even if I 'ave to eat dirt!</i><br/>
<br/>
I told him I was behind him all the way...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Persona3-29-259.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and boy, am I glad he didn't misunderstand.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Bebe: Jitsu wa, actually...I 'ave a plan! I will return 'ome...mochiron, of course, I will not give up just like zat! I will come back 'ere after persuading my uncle! I will convince 'im 'ow great Japan eez! Now, I just 'ave to figure out 'ow to explain it to 'im. Zat will be easy with your 'elp, Minato-sama!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Persona3-29-268.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Now how could I resist that face?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Persona3-29-270.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Persona3-29-271.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I mean, er, us guys gotta stick together!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Persona3-29-272.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Persona3-29-273.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Persona3-29-274.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Macho male bonding and all that!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-Persona3-29-275.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That evening, I went to go see Mutatsu again, probably because he didn't give me butterflies when we talked like Bebe does.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Persona3-29-276.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: He said they're runnin' a small restaurant. I guess it's pretty popular. My son's married, and his wife's pregnant...that makes me feel so old.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Persona3-29-279.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: I won't be back until they've forgiven me. I'll get down on my knees if I hafta. And if my son wants to sock me in the face, well, that's fine too. I-I've been thinkin' about what I'm gonna say to my wife...even though I'm not so good with words...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-Persona3-29-283.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Well, that's terrible, and since it was Mutatsu I knew I could tell him so.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-Persona3-29-286.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-Persona3-29-288.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: But I finally faced the fact that I was drinkin' to hide my true feelings. I feel so free now.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Persona3-29-291.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: You reminded me of my son. Maybe Buddha sent you to help me...I gotta admit, I believe in fate. If I hadn't met you, I'd never have seen my family again. I owe ya, kid...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-Persona3-29-298.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-Persona3-29-299.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
My life is still a goddamn mess...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-Persona3-29-300.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Persona3-29-301.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-Persona3-29-303.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-Persona3-29-304.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...but at least someone else's is on the right track now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Persona3-29-308.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
(<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_You" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chi You</a> is a Chinese god of war.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Persona3-29-309.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Persona3-29-310.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: When you mix Cointreasu with white rum, lemon juice, and ice...you get a cocktail called "XYZ."</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-Persona3-29-313.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-Persona3-29-314.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: Plus, it tastes sooo good goin' down. I'll be prayin' that your future is XYZ...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-Persona3-29-317.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-Persona3-29-318.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-Persona3-29-319.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
With warm fuzzies in my heart, I headed back to the dorm for the evening.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The next day, I promptly slept through class due to being at the bar all night talking with a former drunkard monk. Whoops.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Junpei went to go see Chidori again after school.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-Persona3-29-322.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chidori: I wasn't expecting them to. That's why they started watching me in the first place. <br/>
Junpei: Oh, how's that cut doin'? Prolly already healed, huh...so how come you're not drawing today?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="113-Persona3-29-327.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Well, uh, not really...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="114-Persona3-29-329.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Junpei noticed that the flowers sitting by Chidori's bed weren't doing so well.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-Persona3-29-330.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-Persona3-29-331.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Before he could move them, though, Chidori reached out and touched them, causing a surge of light to flow into them from her hand.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="117-Persona3-29-332.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chidori: ...I made them healthy again.<br/>
Junpei: You can do that?! That's incredible, Chidori!<br/>
Chidori: It's nothing special. You have powers too, don't you?<br/>
Junpei: Well, yeah, I guess...but...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="118-Persona3-29-339.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: WIthout that...I'd be a nobody. I just talk a big game, pretendin' like I'm some kinda hero. But in reality...I don't know what the hell I'm fighting for...or why I'm here at all.<br/>
Chidori: Why...why we are here?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-Persona3-29-346.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chidori: What kind of dream?<br/>
Junpei: That one ady, I'd grow up to be a pro baseball player. Pretty stupid, huh? I guess that's part of bein' a kid.<br/>
Chidori: Is that so...? I don't remember much from my childhood. All I remember is being surrounded by white...<br/>
Junpei: Huh?<br/>
Chidori: I hate hospitals...<br/>
Junpei: Yeah, me too...I'm sorry...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-Persona3-29-359.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Persona3-29-360.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Chidori...I...I understand. I won't let you down.</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That day after school, I went to go accept Fuuka's invitation to try her cooking.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: I want you to taste the lunch I packed. To be honest, I don't have very much confidence in my cooking...but today, I think it turned out okay.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="123-Persona3-29-377.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I was pretty sure my life was finally going to end, and not by being eaten by a Shadow...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="124-Persona3-29-379.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...but by self-induced food poisoning.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="125-Persona3-29-380.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="126-Persona3-29-381.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh god...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="127-Persona3-29-383.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Here it comes...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="128-Persona3-29-386.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...To my credit, I didn't puke-a all over Fuuka. But she did want me to be honest, so I told her it tasted like shit. Not even shit...fried shit that had been eaten by a skunk and then shat out again, then the skunk sprayed on it, then it was fried AGAIN and served to me.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="129-Persona3-29-389.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
She took it surprisingly well.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="130-Persona3-29-391.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: I'm sorry I made you taste test my cooking...but I know that you'll always be honest with me. I depend on you...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="131-Persona3-29-396.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="132-Persona3-29-397.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Wait a second...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="133-Persona3-29-398.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="134-Persona3-29-399.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Is this ANOTHER romantic interest?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="135-Persona3-29-400.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Woohoo!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="136-Persona3-29-404.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We went back to the dorm together, and that night, at the Dark Hour...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="137-Persona3-29-405.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...Pharos showed up again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="138-Persona3-29-406.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Pharos: Time goes by so quickly, and many things change. Yet some things will always remain the same...don't you agree?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="139-Persona3-29-413.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Pharos: ...That tower, for instance. I've been thinking about it lately...I wonder...will our relationship stay the same...? Or will it evolve? No matter what the future holds, you and I will be friends...that is for certain.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-Persona3-29-420.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="141-Persona3-29-421.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It's safe to say that he really creeps me out.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="142-Persona3-29-422.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="143-Persona3-29-423.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="144-Persona3-29-424.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh well, he comes and goes as he pleases so it's not like there's much I can do about him.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="145-Persona3-29-426.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Today, I went to go see Akinari again. It's turning into a weekly routine.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: I know it probably looked pretty bad last time, right? ...I had been reading a book before you came that day. I got so absorbed in the reading that I forgot to close the window, and I didn't realize how chilly it was.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="146-Persona3-29-430.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="147-Persona3-29-433.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: I read a lot of books these days. I find that they're the easiest ways to spend my time, since I can get lost in a book's private world. Do you read books all the way to the end? I really get into the story and usually reach the end quickly, but...I never want to finish it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="148-Persona3-29-442.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="149-Persona3-29-443.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: Stories about hope or heroism...those're the kinds of books I read. So hopefully, if I do decide to finish reading them, I'll feel happy at the end when I come back here.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="150-Persona3-29-448.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="151-Persona3-29-449.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Y'know...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="152-Persona3-29-450.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="153-Persona3-29-451.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="154-Persona3-29-452.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...it might be hypocritical to say this, but if I were in his position, I'd try harder to enjoy my last days. I wonder if I can explain that to him how...well, I guess I'll think about it later, but I'm going to bed for now. See ya everyone!<br/>
