<br/>
<i>Fuuka: So what happened to capturing the tank?<br/>
Ikutsuki: Oh, that's been taken care of. Come here, Aigis.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Persona3-20-506.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...well, I guess it isn't more weird than any of the other crap that keeps going on. My life is such a goddamn mess.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>Yukari: No way...it's like she's...alive.<br/>
Akihiko: This is unbelievable...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Persona3-20-511.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I dunno if trying to hit on a robot or trying to hit on a tranny was worse. So, so nasty. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-gonk.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Persona3-20-512.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ikutsuki: Aigis was the last to be made...and she's the only one that still remains today.<br/>
Mitsuru: An anti-Shadow weapon..does that mean she...?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Persona3-20-515.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...Okay, not only is she a robot, but she's a robot with a Persona. Y'know, a supernatural manifestation of your personality, which robots <i>aren't supposed to have</i>. Good god. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-gonk.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Persona3-20-516.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ikutsuki: It's still unclear as to why she suddenly reactivated herself this morning. Well, I hope you will all get along.<br/>
Fuuka: An anti-Shadow weapon with a will of her own...this is amazing!<br/>
Yukari: Um, by the way...when I saw you earlier, Aigis, it seemed like you knew him...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Persona3-20-523.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I guess this is the opposite of a RealDoll. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-smith.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Persona3-20-524.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ikutsuki: Or maybe she's still half asleep...this is quite interesting. Hmm...well, I can ponder this later. Oh, I forgot to tell you all...you can participate in a wide range of recreational activities here. There's a tennis court, a pool table, even a karaoke machine. Would you care to hear me sing?</i><br/>
<br/>
It turns out we didn't have much of a choice, so that evening was like a horrible nightmare of terrible music.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Persona3-20-532.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day was the last day of our trip:<br/>

<br/>
<i>Junpei: But I can't complain...a lot of cool things happened while we were here.</i><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, like nearly getting turned into some pervert's sex slaves. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-gonk.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Persona3-20-535.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akihiko: We were all up late last night...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Persona3-20-537.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The girls showed up then...I guess Aigis is a girl too, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Naah, it's nothing like that. We just came here to have some fun.<br/>
Fuuka: Do you understand what it means to "have fun", Aigis?<br/>
Aigis: Of course. Recreation is the refreshment of one's mind and body.<br/>
Junpei: Exactly! Wow, you sure know a lot about us humans. Alright, let's take one last dip before we leave!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Persona3-20-543.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: Is it okay for Aigis to go into the ocean?<br/>
Yukari: Oh, I'm sure she's waterproof.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Persona3-20-546.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Persona3-20-547.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Persona3-20-548.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Damn, she's pretty lifelike.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Persona3-20-553.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ikutsuki: We've been quite busy during our time here, but it looks as if we can relax a bit today. I'm glad to see everyone is having so much fun. I've already told you what time the ship will be arriving tomorrow, yes? I'll most likely head over to the port early, so don't be late.<br/>
Akihiko: Okay, I'll let everyone know.<br/>
Ikutsuki: Until then, enjoy the last day of your vacation.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Persona3-20-563.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Persona3-20-564.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Wow, vacation's been so busy that I totally forgot about these things.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Persona3-20-565.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Persona3-20-566.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Persona3-20-567.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I guess I DID find out a lot more about everyone, though, so it makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Persona3-20-568.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That night, I had a dream...I saw the hideout near Port Island station, where Shinjiro was hanging out with the other punks.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Persona3-20-569.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Punk: Shut up! Let's go!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Persona3-20-571.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Persona3-20-572.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Takaya: They're like back alley rats.<br/>
Shinjiro: Beats me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Persona3-20-575.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Jin threw a package of medicine capsules to Shinjiro.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Persona3-20-576.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Shinjiro: I'll pay you the same as--<br/>
Jin: Hold up.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Persona3-20-579.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Pale Man: Your acquaintances have been busy lately. I'm referring to their activities on nights when the moon is full. They've spent a great deal of time in the tower as well. Why did they take this burden upon themselves?<br/>
Shinjiro: ...<br/>
Pale Man: You do know, don't you? But you don't wish to say...is it  because they are your friends?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Persona3-20-586.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Pale Man: Then tell us.<br/>
Shinjiro: Tch...I don't know the details, but supposedly if you destroy all those creatures, then the tower will disappear, and with it the Dark Hour.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Persona3-20-592.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The two men weren't happy about this at al.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Persona3-20-593.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Shinjiro: Y-yeah...why?<br/>
Pale Man: Why would they do such a thing?! With the power they have...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Persona3-20-596.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Shinjiro: Tower of Demise...? Who wouldn't wanna take out that damn tower?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Persona3-20-599.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The trio left, and Shinjiro was alone once more.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Persona3-20-600.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Persona3-20-601.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The dream ended there.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Persona3-20-603.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That night, we got back to the dorm.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: It seemed to take forever to get back...<br/>
Fuuka: Yeah, it was a tiring trip. Please rest up so you're ready for the next operation.<br/>
Junpei: Yeah, yeah. I don't have any plans for summer break, so I can fight Shadows all you want.<br/>
Yukari: Wow, you must really be bored.<br/>
Junpei: Sh-shut up, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucatan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Yuka-tan</a>.<br/>
Yukari: Whatever. We just have to defeat those last six, and it'll all be over. The Lost will get better, and everything will be back to normal, right?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Persona3-20-614.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yukari's right - we had a break, but now we have to get back to business. We'll start with more Tartarus soon. For now, later!<br/>
<br/>
<i><b>Coming up in the next entry: One last week of class, then summer break! Also we fight monsters and stuff.</b></i>
