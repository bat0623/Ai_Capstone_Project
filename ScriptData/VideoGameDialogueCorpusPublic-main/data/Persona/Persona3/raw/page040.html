(<i>Auto-transcribed voice post</i>)<br/>
<br/>
Hey guys, I'm posting from my cell phone to let you all know that we've finally finished off the last Shadow! It's all over! No more Shadows, no more Dark Hour, no more fighting, no more dying, no more nothing. And thank God for that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-Persona3-36-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
As for what actually happened...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Persona3-36-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
During the Dark Hour yesterday, Fuuka found the Shadow without a hitch.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Persona3-36-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: And as expected, there are two Persona-users nearby...Strega.<br/>
Mitsuru: They know this is their last chance. Even though we were expecting this, we should be careful.<br/>
Ken: Those bastards...<br/>
Akihiko: Hmph. Saves us the trouble of looking for them.<br/>
Mitsuru: You've all done a fine job up to this point. This will be our last operation; let's come back safely.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Persona3-36-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I grabbed Akihiko, Junpei, and Yukari, and we were off.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Persona3-36-022.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Persona3-36-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We couldn't just get to the Shadow, though...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Persona3-36-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...because Takaya and Jin weren't about to have that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Persona3-36-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Takaya: You claim to hunt the Shadows to prevent the disaster they bring, yet countless lives are lost every day without their intervention. The power we wield is not itself evil...you cannot deny that. So why don't you just admit it? You do not wish to eliminate the Dark Hour...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Persona3-36-030.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Persona3-36-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Takaya: Erasing the Dark Hour is the same as erasing yourselves. Tch...is even that beyond your comprehension? As I believed, our goals are irreconcilable.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Persona3-36-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Takaya: Fate shall decide who shall prevail.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Persona3-36-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1823708676344309750&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boss - Takaya and Jin</a> (<i>These guys aren't really all that impressive given all the buildup before fighting them. I also find it hilarious that having a grenade explode right under you hurts less than pretty much everything else these guys can do.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-hypnos.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
(<i>Takaya's Persona is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnos" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hypnos</a> of the Fortune Arcana, though I don't recall this ever being explicitly stated ingame. This is symbolic, of course, and will make sense later on.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Moros.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
(<i>Jin's Persona is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moros" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Moros</a> of the Hermit Arcana, which is also never explicitly stated.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Persona3-36-043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We fought fiercely and eventually defeated Strega.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Persona3-36-044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: Different?<br/>
Jin: For us, it's not that simple...it has to be forced out. Didn't you pal tell you?<br/>
Akihiko: So it was you who was giving Shinji those pills.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Persona3-36-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Jin: It won't matter for normal people, since they don't remember anything anyway. But for us...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Persona3-36-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Takaya: Now, then...ordinary we'd withdraw, but not tonight. This body, as ephemeral as it is...it is worthless without  my power. Therefore, only one choice remains..I shall prove my existence here and now!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Persona3-36-059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Takaya prepared to shoot himself, but Jin stopped him.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Persona3-36-060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Takaya: Jin?!<br/>
Jin: ...Sorry, but those are your words, not mine.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Persona3-36-064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Jin: Go do what you came for.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Persona3-36-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The two of them moved to the edge of the bridge...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Persona3-36-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and before we could stop them...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Persona3-36-070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...they leapt to their deaths.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Persona3-36-072.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: They jumped...<br/>
Junpei: What the hell were they thinking?!<br/>
Akihiko: They chose their own fate. Don't let it phase you.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Persona3-36-077.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
There was nothing we could do for Strega, so instead...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Persona3-36-079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...we gathered our strength and prepared to battle the final Shadow.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8661821254257271599&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boss - Hanged Man</a> (<i>This is another of those bosses that's painful because it takes so damn long to kill, not because it's actually dangerous. Hanged Man spends the majority of the battle out of attack range, so you spend that time killing his Statues to bring him down. The only dangerous attack it has is Akasha Arts, but support skills can render that pretty tame.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Persona3-36-081.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Once it was dead, we breathed a collective sigh of relief.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Persona3-36-082.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: Yes...it's finally over...<br/>
Aigis: I believe a celebration is in order.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Persona3-36-090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: You don't waste any time, do you? Well, I suppose I can arrange for it.<br/>
Junpei: Ooh! In that case, how about sushi?!<br/>
Akihiko: Sushi, huh? It's been awhile...well, I've got dibs on the halibut and sea urchin!<br/>
Yukari: Okay, then I call the fatty tuna.<br/>
Fuuka: Um, we're divvying it up already? In that case, save me the salmon roe.<br/>
Junpei: Hey, wait a minute! You can't do that!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Persona3-36-098.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Persona3-36-099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ken: You should all be ashamed of yourselves, fighting over sushi...Senpai, please order tamago for me. They say you can tell a chef's skill by how he prepares eggs.<br/>
Yukari: Um...how old are you again?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Persona3-36-103.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: For real?! Aw man, it's great to be alive!<br/>
Yukari: Don't get too excited, Junpei. You're getting the leftovers.<br/>
Junpei: What?! But it was my idea in the first place!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Persona3-36-109.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We got our last look at the eerie green moon...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Persona3-36-114.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Persona3-36-116.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and headed home for the night.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Persona3-36-118.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next morning, though...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Persona3-36-119.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...Pharos showed up again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Persona3-36-120.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Makes sense, since there's no more Dark Hour, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Persona3-36-121.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Pharos: All the fragments of my memory...they've finally come together. I now know my role clearly. The time has come. As difficult as it may be, I must tell you something...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Persona3-36-126.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Pharos: I want you to know that for me, our friendship was a miracle. But miracles don't last forever. If only they did...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Persona3-36-131.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Pharos: Even if today is the end, the bond between us can never be severed. Remember that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Persona3-36-134.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Persona3-36-135.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And with that, he vanished for the last time.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Persona3-36-136.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Persona3-36-137.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I doubt I'll ever understand what was up with him...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Persona3-36-138.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Persona3-36-139.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...but I hope he's happy, wherever he is.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Persona3-36-142.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Persona3-36-146.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
(<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanatos" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Thanatos</a> is, simply put, Death incarnate. He's also the "mascot" Persona for this game, like Asura in Persona 1 and Maya in Persona 2.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Persona3-36-147.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
At school today, Junpei was psyched for tonight's party.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Persona3-36-156.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I was, too, so I went straight home after class.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Persona3-36-157.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Man, I'm starving...can we eat?<br/>
ken: Hey, where are Ikutsuki-san and Aigis-san?<br/>
Akihiko: He took her to the lab for a tune-up or something. He said they'll join us later.<br/>
Fuuka: The Chairman just can't stay away from the lab, can he?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Persona3-36-163.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We heard a car arrive in front of the dorm...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Persona3-36-164.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...turns out it was Mr. Kirijo.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Persona3-36-165.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: Yes.<br/>
Takeharu: Congratulations, everyone. You've done well. There are no words to express my gratitude. Though you will never recieve the recognition you deserve, it is undoubtedly a monumental achievement.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Persona3-36-170.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Takeharu: ...For lending us your power until the very end.<br/>
Yukari: Oh, it's...it's no big deal.<br/>
Takeharu: The twelve Shadows that were the cause of all our troubles have been destroyed, thanks to your efforts. You needn't bear this burden any longer; you deserve a chance to experience the joys of youth.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Persona3-36-175.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Takeharu: No longer must you put your lives on the line in battle. Tomorrow, you can triumphantly return to a normal school life.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Persona3-36-178.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
As you can probably imagine, we weren't too thrilled about this - SEES was our life for the past six months. Simply dissolving it didn't go over too well.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Persona3-36-180.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Persona3-36-181.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Sweet! I've been waiting for you to say that!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Persona3-36-184.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Persona3-36-185.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It's finally over. We did it. We won.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Persona3-36-186.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Persona3-36-187.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Persona3-36-188.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...School is going to be <i>so</i> boring now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Persona3-36-190.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: I have an idea...how 'bout we all take a picture? Actually, I tried to take one last night, but I forgot it wouldn't work during the Dark Hour.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Persona3-36-197.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: I feel like such a tourist...but I have to admit, I kinda want a picture, too.<br/>
Junpei: Oh, wait, Ikutsuki-san and Aigis aren't here...I guess we'll have to take another one later. Alright, everyone get together.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Persona3-36-202.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Persona3-36-203.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4392750514660866984&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Victory Portrait</a><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Persona3-36-206.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
After the picture, we went back to our feast...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Persona3-36-207.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...well, Junpei did anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Persona3-36-216.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Persona3-36-217.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh, we haven't seen Ikutuski or Aigis yet...well, they'll show up soon. Anyway, I've gotta get back to the party, but I'll keep on blogging away, Shadows or not. Hope you guys keep on reading, even when my entries become boring school stuff again. At least you don't have to worry I'll die and stop posting entries here, yeah?<br/>
<br/>
Well, see ya, everyone.<br/>
<br/>
