		<b>Entry Thirty: October 3rd, 2009</b><br/><br/>
<b>Mood:</b> <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-gonk.gif"/> Anxious<br/>
<b>Music:</b> I'm trying a little Nightwish this time to see if it chills me out.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the music thing isn't working as far as chilling me out before the Ordeal goes, so instead it looks like I'm blogging once again. I seriously think I'm addicted or something...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-Persona3-31-001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Anyway, after I wrote last time, we ended up going to Tartarus.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Persona3-31-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Before I even went in, I did my first Cross Fusion, combining the various members of the Frost family with Queen Mab...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Persona3-31-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...to produce <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fonzie" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Black Frost</a>, who is fucking badass.<br/>
<br/>
	<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Persona3-31-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
His main strength is his resistance to both Ice and Fire, but he's also got a great variety of attack skills and inherited Recarm, so he's nice to fall back on. Also, he's motherfucking Black Frost. Just look at him.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Persona3-31-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I also made a few filler Personas for fusion fodder and to fill out the Compedium; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loa" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Loa</a>, for instance...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Persona3-31-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leanan_Sidhe" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Leanan Sidhe</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Persona3-31-009.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Persona3-31-010.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Persona3-31-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh, when I showed Elizabeth Black Frost, she was so awed that she gave me a Wizard's Mark for free. That's how awesome he is.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Persona3-31-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Anyway, up we went into the fourth block, Tziah...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Persona3-31-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...taking out Shadows on the way.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Persona3-31-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This one's new; the Tranquil Idol liked to use Hama skills to instantly kill us, which was a serious problem for me since I was using Black Frost. I switched Personas as soon as possible when we ran into them.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Persona3-31-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
These Hakurou Mushas were samurai-like Shadows that had an annoying tendency to dodge physical attacks. Mudo worked like a charm on them, though.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Persona3-31-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
There was also a Shadow shaped like a <i>tank</i>, of all things. They looked scary, but Zio skills and All-Out Attacks worked great on them, and they didn't roam in packs.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Persona3-31-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Constancy Relics are pretty nondescript, though Junpei had a field day with them thanks to their weakness to Fire.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Persona3-31-023.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Persona3-31-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I had trouble getting a good look at these Blue Sigils; they were surrounded by a rotating cube of paper that obsured our vision and make it difficult to target them. They were only dangerous to Akihiko, though, since they only had Ice skills.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Persona3-31-095.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Elegant Mothers were kind of disturbing, but fortunately they were easy to take out, too.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Persona3-31-024.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Persona3-31-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Before long, we got to the next Guardian...<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-587162846939910591&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tartarus Boss 12 - Arcane Turrets</a> (<i>These guys aren't too tough; they're weak to Ice, unlike standard Arcane Turrets who are weak to Electricity, so a few shots of Bufu and some All-Out Attacks will make short work of them.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Persona3-31-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
After we brought down the Turrets, we kept on going up. I'd taken up using a bludgeon like Shinjiro; I like to think I'm pretty good with it, but it's not like it takes a lot of practice to learn how to squash things.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Persona3-31-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I also made a few more Personas; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitama" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Saki Mitama</a> was a support-centered Persona that'd come in handy later...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Persona3-31-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...as was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvati" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Parvati</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Persona3-31-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Parvati learned another of those handy mass support skills, too.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Persona3-31-091.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangda" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rangda</a> focused on debilitating skills, which really wasn't that handy...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Persona3-31-092.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...but fused well into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shesha" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ananta</a>, who was better able to utilize those skills and gave me a nice strength boost besides.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Persona3-31-079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nandi_%28bull%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nandi</a> wasn't really intended for combat; instead, I made him to relate better to Mamoru when we hung out.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Persona3-31-039.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Persona3-31-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Even Fuuka learned some new skills - Healing Wave kept us going by restoring some HP and SP every time we changed floors.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Persona3-31-027.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Persona3-31-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We ran into another Guardian a few floors up...<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2950232001838336135&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tartarus Boss 13 - Sleeping Table</a> (<i>This one, on the other hand, is a massive pain in the ass. It does a ton of damage with Maragidyne and Megidola, and without Mediarahan to heal up you're basically screwed. This means I had to grind for awhile before facing it; this is one of the few bosses where it helps.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Persona3-31-087.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Persona3-31-088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and after that, we reached the top of the currently open area and found the sixth Old Document.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I knew it. These Shadows arise due to human emotion. If I'm right, collecting them will...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Persona3-31-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Everyone was beat after that, so we wrapped it up for the night.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Persona3-31-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day was a Sunday, so I went to go see Akinari.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Persona3-31-043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: I thought I'd be fine since I have many nights when I'm unable to sleep because of my illness, but...I guess my condition won't improve if I keep taking chances. I came all this way because I was hoping to find you...remember how I talked about reading upbeat stories?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Persona3-31-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: The problem is, all those stories were written for someone else. I guess what I'm saying is selfish, but I'm being selfish about you, too. You're always coming to see me, and I take up a lot of your time...how much of your valuable time have you used on visiting me?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Persona3-31-057.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Persona3-31-058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Nice to hear I'm a light in this guy's life...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Persona3-31-060.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Persona3-31-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...he really doesn't seem to have much else.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Persona3-31-062.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Persona3-31-063.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Persona3-31-064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I'm glad I met him just because of that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Persona3-31-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That night, you-know-who showed up again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Persona3-31-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Pharos: I hope nothing serious happens. But who knows what the future will bring...so be careful. Remember, I'm always watching you...we'll meet again.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Persona3-31-080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I hung out with Mamoru the next afternoon, but it didn't go anywhere...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Persona3-31-100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...likewise with Bebe the next day...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Persona3-31-101.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and a couple days after that, I hung out with Mamoru again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Persona3-31-102.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: Yum...oh man, just a few more. This is kind of just what I do...I like to eat pretty fast.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Persona3-31-108.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: That was pretty fast compared to my record. Anyways, Minato...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Persona3-31-111.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>There's going to be a coach there from a big athletic college. You know what that means? If I do well enough, I might get a scholarship nod. Then I don't have to quit the Track Team...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Persona3-31-116.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: We really didn't have the money. But then I hear about a chance at a scholarship...do you see now why it's such a big deal? If I win, I might be able to go to college after all! I bet my mother would be really relieved.</i><br/>
<br/>
I told him it sounded like a good plan...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Persona3-31-121.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and he agreed.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Persona3-31-122.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: If he was still around, my brothers wouldn't have to worry about whether or not they'd get to eat every day. ...well, complaining isn't going to accomplish anything! I'll just have to hope for that reccomendation.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Persona3-31-126.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Persona3-31-127.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Wow, and I thought I was dedicated when it came to fighting Shadows...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Persona3-31-128.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Persona3-31-129.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Persona3-31-130.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...I guess we've all got our own stuff to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Persona3-31-132.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Speaking of dealing with stuff, I have to deal with sorting out my feelings for Bebe at some point before he leaves. Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Persona3-31-133.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I mean my totally platonic feelings for him, of course.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Persona3-31-134.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Nothing else.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Persona3-31-135.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Bebe: Hm, so far so good, ne? Right? When my uncle sees zis, I know he'll agree wiz me about how great Nihon eez!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Persona3-31-141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Bebe: Arigatou! Zank you!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Persona3-31-143.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Persona3-31-144.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yup, all that macho sewing is totally building up my pecs.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Persona3-31-145.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Persona3-31-146.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Persona3-31-147.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Even Mitsuru won't be able to resist me before long, yeah baby!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Persona3-31-153.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Anyway, today Ms. Toriumi reminded us all about the exams that were coming up (ugh)...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Persona3-31-154.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and I hung out with Yuko after school. I have to admit I was pretty distracted...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Persona3-31-155.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...because tomorrow's another of those nights, and I don't have anything left to blog about to take my mind off it, not to mention this music's starting to drive me nuts.<br/>
<br/>
Wish me luck, guys.<br/>
<br/>
