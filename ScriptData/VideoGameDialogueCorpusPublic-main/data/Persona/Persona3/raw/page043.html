		<b>Entry Thirty-Eight: November 16th, 2009</b><br/><br/>
<b>Mood:</b> <img alt="" border="0" src="1-emot-ssj.gif"/> Psyched!<br/>
<b>Music:</b> The Juliana Theory. My taste in music is as great as always.<br/>
<br/>
Whew, the class trip is tomorrow and you wouldn't believe how glad I am about that. I need a break like Junpei needs a shower. We're not leaving the country or anything, but still; a break's a break.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Persona3-38-001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
As for what's been going on lately, it turns out I'm not the new kid at school anymore.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Persona3-38-002.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Persona3-38-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Well, technically Aigis "transferred" in after me, but she's not really a kid, she's more of an instrument of destruction.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Persona3-38-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The new guy's in my class, too.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Persona3-38-009.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Persona3-38-011.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Persona3-38-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I guess that scarf has magical powers or something...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Persona3-38-013.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Persona3-38-014.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Persona3-38-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...since all the girls in the class immediately went gaga over Ryoji.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Persona3-38-020.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Persona3-38-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ms. Toriumi: Be sure to explain them to him. Now then, you need a seat. Let's see...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Persona3-38-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
After Ryoji found a seat, he stopped to greet Aigis as he passed...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Persona3-38-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and to hit on her. I can already tell this guy's going to get along great here.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Persona3-38-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Aigis didn't take it too well; I guess that'd have to do with her not having any hormones because she's a <b>robot</b>. Wasn't it the Chairman's idea for her to come to school? It turned out he was evil, we should totally void any of his previous schemes like this.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Persona3-38-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ryoji, and pretty much everyone else, was oblivious to the fact that she is in fact a robot...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Persona3-38-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...even when she kept dropping hints like she drops nuclear weapons on Shadows.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Persona3-38-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ryoji: Haha, rejected from the start. You're an interesting girl...<br/>
Yukari: Ugh...<br/>
Ms. Toriumi: Your teacher understands, Aigis...you haven't had very long to be the "new student", and already you have to share the spotlight. I wish your classmates would pay attention to me for a change...hey, are any of you even listening?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Persona3-38-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I'd almost forgotten about the class trip to Kyoto until Ms. Toriumi brought it up. I've been psyched for it since.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Persona3-38-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
After school that day, I played with Maiko...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Persona3-38-047.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Persona3-38-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and the next morning, Yukari told me that Mitsuru was coming back that evening. I was glad to hear it; it had been hard to not worry about her after what had happened.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Persona3-38-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
After school that day, I spent some time with Chihiro.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Persona3-38-052.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Chihiro seemed to be feeling strange, so I asked her what was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Persona3-38-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chihiro: Oh my, is there red bean jam on my face...? ...Remember when you saved me from that creep, Minato-san? From that day on, my health hasn't been so great...the doctor said I'm fine, but...I guess I'll tell you, Minato-san, since you've been so nice to me! B-but don't think I'm weird, okay?!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Persona3-38-062.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Persona3-38-063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I was honestly not sure if I should be flattered or horrified.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Persona3-38-064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chihiro: I dream about you every night...this has never happened to me before. I appreciate how nice you've been to me, Minato-san...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Persona3-38-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Well damn, I never would've guessed.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Persona3-38-072.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Persona3-38-073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
She dreams about me every night, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Persona3-38-074.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Persona3-38-075.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Persona3-38-076.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That's...actually kind of adorable.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Persona3-38-078.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It also means that I should probably watch my ass around Yuko and Fuuka from now on.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Persona3-38-079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chihiro: I get so nervous when I'm around you, Minato-san...especially when you look at me that way...sorry...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Persona3-38-087.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chihiro: So far, I can only talk to boys I know, but...I can almost look them in the eye! With your help, Minato-san, I feel like I can do even better! As long as it's nothing scary...I'll be fine!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Persona3-38-095.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I figured it was time for a nice gesture, so I took her hand.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Persona3-38-098.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Persona3-38-099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I think she took it as a little more than just a "nice gesture", though...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Persona3-38-102.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Persona3-38-103.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That evening, Mitsuru had in fact returned, but she had went up to her room right as she got home. I'm not sure I could blame her.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Persona3-38-105.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
After school the next day, I went to see Maiko again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Persona3-38-106.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Persona3-38-107.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
She was distraught over something...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Persona3-38-109.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and I was shocked to find out what it was when she calmed down a little.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Persona3-38-110.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maiko: Why would Dad do that? Why? All I did was say I wanted to know the real reason they were getting a divorce. They told me I was too young to even understand it. So I kept asking, and Dad got angry, and then he...he...then Mom said since I was so annoying, that it was my fault.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Persona3-38-118.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maiko: I bet they wouldn't care if I was even there at all! What if I ran away from home...? I want to find out how they really feel about me...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Persona3-38-125.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Persona3-38-126.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I thought about going to the cops, but I figured that'd only make the situation worse.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Persona3-38-129.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Persona3-38-130.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
At least she's got someone she can trust, I guess...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Persona3-38-131.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Persona3-38-132.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Persona3-38-133.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and that's really all I can do for her right now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Persona3-38-135.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day I went to see Chihiro again...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Persona3-38-140.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and Kenji the day after that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Persona3-38-142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
After school the next day, I "saw" Yukari go to see Mitsuru, who had been hiding out on the roof.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Persona3-38-143.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Persona3-38-144.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: Well, yeah, even though I'm not a member.<br/>
Mitsuru: ...Sorry about that.<br/>
Yukari: They seem pretty busy, what with the class trip and all. I bet you have your hands full, since it's for both juniors and seniors.<br/>
Mitsuru: Hmph...the class trip, huh...even if I went, I'd only spoil the fun.<br/>
Yukari: You're not thinking of skipping the trip, are you?<br/>
Mitsuru: ...<br/>
Yukari: You can't do that!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Persona3-38-154.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: Is that so?<br/>
Yukari: To tell you the truth, you're not the easiest person to relate to. But I know what it's like to lose a father...<br/>
Mitsuru: Takeba...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Persona3-38-159.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
They were about to have a moment...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Persona3-38-162.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...before Ryoji showed up.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Persona3-38-163.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ryoji: I've been looking everywhere for you!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Persona3-38-167.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ryoji: Huh? Same as you, I was trying to find Mitsuru-senpai. Some girl I've never met before asked me to look for her...<br/>
Yukari: What?<br/>
Ryoji: I wasn't the only one she asked, either. She said if we didn't find her, the class trip might get cancelled...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Persona3-38-173.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Persona3-38-174.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Persona3-38-175.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ryoji, I quickly learned, has absolutely no concept of "timing".<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Persona3-38-178.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Persona3-38-179.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, Yukari acted fast and saved Ryoji from a kick to the balls.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Persona3-38-180.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: Takeba...thank you for your concern. For now, I will attend to my duties.<br/>
Ryoji: Hey, she didn't answer my question...<br/>
Yukari: "For now", huh? I don't like the sound of that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Persona3-38-185.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ryoji: I know this place on Shirakawa Boulevard...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Persona3-38-187.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Bad move.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Persona3-38-188.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I could almost feel the bones in my foot breaking in sympathy as Yukari stomped him.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Persona3-38-190.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
As for me, I saw Chihiro that day...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-Persona3-38-191.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Persona3-38-192.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and considered going to Tartarus that night since Mitsuru was back, but decided against it. Wasn't in the mood.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Persona3-38-197.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day was a Sunday, and since I didn't have anything else to do, I went to see Chihiro again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-Persona3-38-199.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chihiro: Sorry about that...um...your coffee is going to get cold.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Persona3-38-205.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I offered her sugar as a change of subject, and she accepted gratefully.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Persona3-38-208.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It's nice that things are going well with her.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Persona3-38-211.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I also gave her a gift: a watch I'd gotten from Tanaka's show a few months back.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Persona3-38-213.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
She was thrilled. Tanaka might not be a cold-hearted bastard after all.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Persona3-38-221.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Today, the teachers reminded us again about the trip, as if I wasn't excited enough already...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Persona3-38-222.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and after school, I saw Maiko again.	<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Persona3-38-223.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maiko: I yelled at them to please stop fighting so much...but they told me to just leave them alone.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Persona3-38-227.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maiko: I'd better start packing soon...what do you think I need to pack if I'm running away from home? I'll need lots of snacks, right? What about my health insurance card? Maybe my PJs and my toothbrush...what else?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-Persona3-38-240.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maiko: Don't worry. I'm going to be just fine, okay? I'm gonna miss you, though...it won't be easy to be alone.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Persona3-38-244.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Persona3-38-245.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Again, I'd go to the police about this...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-Persona3-38-246.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-Persona3-38-247.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-Persona3-38-248.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...but they've been so swamped with Apathy Syndrome reports that I doubt they'd be able to help.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Persona3-38-249.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
At least her parents will still have the common decency to work together and find their daughter...<br/>
<br/>
...right?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-Persona3-38-252.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-Persona3-38-253.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ugh, thinking about that depresses the hell out of me. She'll be fine, and so will the rest of us, since we're going to Kyoto tomorrow. We'll be there for a few days, but I'll be sure to write as soon as I get back. See ya, guys!<br/>
<br/>
