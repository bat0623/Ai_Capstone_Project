		<b>Entry Forty-Two: December 1st, 2009</b><br/><br/>
<b>Mood:</b> <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-gonk.gif"/> Anxious<br/>
<b>Music:</b> A My Chemical Romance Christmas<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow's the full moon, and I'm just as nervous as always...for no reason whatsoever, since we've already killed all the big Shadows. There's nothing to worry about. The world's saved!<br/>
<br/>
...well, except for the psychopathic killers that are still on the loose. And the horrible monsters from another dimension. And the fucked-up space-time continuum. Aside from all that, everything's fine!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-Persona3-41-001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Instead of trying to lie to myself, though, I guess I'll talk about what's been going on lately. For one thing, I've been updating my Persona repertoire...<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mot_%28Semitic_god%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mot</a> is a thing in a coffin. I'm not sure what it is exactly, but it's in there. It's a little too weak to use now, but it's nice to fill out my compendium either way.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Persona3-41-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_%28Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alice</a>, on the other hand, is definitely not too weak to use...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Persona3-41-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...especially with spells like this. (<i>Die For Me! is basically the Dark version of Samsara. Enemies that are weak against Dark die without fail, most other enemies die as well. It's great.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Persona3-41-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I also remembered to fuse Alice so she'd inherit Megido...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Persona3-41-008.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Persona3-41-009.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Persona3-41-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and in doing so fulfilled one of Elizabeth's requests.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Persona3-41-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
After messing around with my Personas, I got back to the business of hanging out with businessmen.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Persona3-41-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Tanaka: I had to pay for transportation, membership renewal, and of course my hotel room. I doubt you'd understand how I feel, since you're still young, but a high school reunion is a very important event...it's the perfect opportunity to show everyone else how pathetic their lives turned out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Persona3-41-021.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Persona3-41-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Tanaka: Now they both look at me with envy. Their annual salary doesn't even compare to my monthly income! My business is on a roll, and my private life is also very satisfying. Let me take you under my wing as our exclusive model. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity. Don't think I would extend this offer to just anyone.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Persona3-41-029.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Persona3-41-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I wonder if Calvin Klein is this creepy.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Persona3-41-031.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Persona3-41-032.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Persona3-41-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...Probably.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Persona3-41-034.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Persona3-41-035.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Persona3-41-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh, and of course he's not giving my money back. I'd be upset if I wasn't richer than God.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Persona3-41-037.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Persona3-41-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Tuesday was Career Experience, and it sucked.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Persona3-41-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Moving on, the day after Career Experience was over I went to talk to Mitsuru after school.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Persona3-41-057.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Persona3-41-058.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Persona3-41-059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
She seemed to be pretty impressed with my academic prowess. I had only, y'know, scored at the top of the class on the previous two tests.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: By the way, Arisato, I'd like to talk to you about something. If you don't mind, can you spare some time?</i><br/>
<br/>
I told her I didn't mind...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Persona3-41-065.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Persona3-41-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and we ended up hanging out after school.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Persona3-41-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I took her to Hagakure, once again living up to my Livejournal username. Maybe it wasn't so badly chosen after all.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Persona3-41-071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
She was oddly concerned with manners at the ramen shop...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Persona3-41-075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: ...I thought it tasted strange at first, but as I continued to eat, I realized it had a subtle charm to it. It's quite delicious.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Persona3-41-081.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ramen Shop Owner: Chef? You talkin' to me?<br/>
Mitsuru: This ramen tastes absolutely wonderful. ...It's been awhile since I last complimented the chef. What do you use for bouillon?<br/>
Ramen Shop Owner: Bouillon? ...What the hell is that? Anyways, if ya want to know the recipe, sorry. i can't tell ya, lady. Without our secret recipe, we'd be outta business.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Persona3-41-088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: Now, this would be considered a meal if one were to eat it with rice, yes? That is very interesting.<br/>
Ramen Shop Owner: Uh, no, that's not, uh...</i><br/>
<br/>
He walked away with an odd look on his face. I couldn't blame him.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Persona3-41-092.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: Oh, sorry. My imagination got the best of me. I've been wanting to try ramen for a long time...does that make me strange?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Persona3-41-100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: I felt extremely awkward coming here alone. I'm so glad you're here with me. You've taught me so much about ramen etiquette. Let's eat here again sometime.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Persona3-41-106.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Persona3-41-107.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Good lord.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Persona3-41-108.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Persona3-41-109.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I've really gotta learn to pick my romantic interests better.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Persona3-41-115.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that evening we all met up in the dining area to try and help Junpei feel like himself again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Persona3-41-116.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: So whaddya want?<br/>
Mitsuru: This came for you. it's from the hospital.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Persona3-41-119.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Persona3-41-120.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: I know I have to snap outta this, but it's just so hard...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Persona3-41-123.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Persona3-41-124.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yukari took Chidori's sketchbook and flipped it open, and we were all surprised at its contents...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: Wow, it's really good...<br/>
Yukari: This is amazing...who wouldn't be able to understand it?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Persona3-41-128.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Persona3-41-129.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I guess in a way, we really wouldn't be able to understand it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Persona3-41-130.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Persona3-41-131.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: ...It's like she's telling me to stop moping around...<br/>
Fuuka: She must be looking out for you.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Persona3-41-137.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
When Junpei turned to look at me, there was a new resolve in his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Persona3-41-138.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Persona3-41-139.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Persona3-41-141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We shook hands.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Persona3-41-144.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Persona3-41-145.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I think he'll be okay now...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Persona3-41-146.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Persona3-41-147.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Persona3-41-148.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and if we keep at it, maybe we really will find a way to get rid of the Dark Hour.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Persona3-41-151.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day was a Sunday, so I went to see Chihiro at the mall.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Persona3-41-152.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chihiro: In the manga that the artist of that book draws, the main character is always a shy girl...her admiration of the boy she likes drives her to become more confident and charming. I want to be like that too...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Persona3-41-159.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oddly enough, Chihiro actually seems a little less creepy than Mitsuru.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Persona3-41-167.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That night during the Dark Hour, we headed to Tartarus.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Persona3-41-166.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I checked out Junpei's new Persona when we arrived. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trismegistus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Trismegistus</a> is basically more of the same from him, though he inherited Chidori's Spring of Life skill. This heals him for a decent amount every turn and doesn't cost anything; it's very useful given his tendency to use physical Skills.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Persona3-41-173.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Persona3-41-172.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I also kept expanding my repertoire. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hariti" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hariti</a> has fifty-one flavors of support Skill, making her one of my best Personas yet...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Persona3-41-175.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
While <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uriel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Uriel</a> doesn't bother with that support crap and just burns things to death.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Persona3-41-178.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Tiger_%28Chinese_constellation%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Byakko</a>, the ultimate Temperance Persona, takes the opposite approach and freezes things to death. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Persona3-41-189.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samael" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Samael</a> is another Persona that I fused to fill the Compendium; he's too weak to use now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Persona3-41-190.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Likewise with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubus_%28demon%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Incubus</a>, which also looks really fucking gross. Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Persona3-41-194.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succubus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Succubus</a> doesn't look quite as horrible, thankfully.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Persona3-41-195.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilith" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lilith</a>, whom I fused using Incubus, Succubus, and a couple others, is very handy. She knows Makarakarn, which reflects any magic attack back to its source; sure, it's expensive, but definitely worth the cost.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Persona3-41-169.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Of course, with Alice and Die For Me!, the new guys didn't see much action. That Skill's name basically says it all.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Persona3-41-171.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
There's no shortage of Guardians left in Tartarus, that's for sure...<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3735976655903979405&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tartarus Boss 17 - Stasis Giants</a> (<i>These guys are pretty straightforward. We use support Skills, they try to kill us, they fail. Watch for the very close call at the end, though.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Persona3-41-174.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...no shortage at all.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5557544265991599591&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tartarus Boss 18 - Phantom King</a> (<i>Give me a break.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Persona3-41-176.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure the things breed when we're not around.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3590712014349712211&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tartarus Boss 19 - Royal Dancers</a> (<i>Strategy? Who needs it? We've got fire.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Persona3-41-177.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
How else could there be so damn many?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1872579615712232859&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tartarus Boss 20 - Reckoning Dice</a> (<i>This one's immune to all magic. Unfortunately, we use Akihiko and Junpei, the most powerful physical characters. Sucks to be it.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Persona3-41-179.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Finally, we reached the end...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-Persona3-41-182.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and found what appeared to be the last of the Old Documents there.<br/>
<br/>
(<i>I'm leaving the team. I can't break the law. But he won't come with me...maybe I'll open an antique store.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Persona3-41-185.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Elizabeth was happy to see it, of course.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Elizabeth: However, you are already moving towards another truth. Although memories may remind you of the past, always walk toward the future...I must admit, I'm a bit envious, since I have neither.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Persona3-41-196.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We wrapped things up in Tartarus for the evening, and the next day I went to see Tanaka again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-Persona3-41-197.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Tanaka: I had an appointment at the spa for a facial peel...isn't my skin positively radiant now? I'm afraid it's all part of the job; I have my fans to think of. At home, I'm completely the opposite. I dress like a slob and only shower once every three days. Let me give you an analogy...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Persona3-41-206.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Tanaka: Imagine an organically grown cucumber that looks deformed. Compare that to a cucumber that looks perfect, but was grown using chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Awkward-shaped cucumbers are difficult to stack, so stores prefer nice straight ones. Taste and safety are not really considered; instead, they carry cucumbers that even mold won't eat. So why do consumers still buy those cucumbers when they know the truth?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Persona3-41-216.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Tanaka: That's why, as much as I hate spending money, I buy expensive ties to win people's trust. ...Wait! You remember what I just said about me dressing up like a slob and not showering everyday...don't tell ANYONE! I can't afford to have people start believing I'm ordinary! I only said it because it was you; you're the only one who knows.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Persona3-41-224.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Persona3-41-225.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Weird.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Persona3-41-226.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Persona3-41-227.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Persona3-41-228.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Weird, weird, weird. What else can I even say?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Persona3-41-230.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-Persona3-41-231.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
At least he's not threatening to do horrible things to me, like defacing my Facebook profile, if I reveal his secrets now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Persona3-41-232.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ryoji was at the dorm when I got home that evening.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Persona3-41-233.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: But then again, you never do...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-Persona3-41-235.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ryoji: You know, I'm here a lot, but I hardly ever run into you. Strange, huh? Oh well, I'm outta here. See ya.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-Persona3-41-238.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: Yeah, he said he was going home.<br/>
Aigis: What was he doing here?<br/>
Yukari: He's been coming here a lot, ever since he started hanging around with Junpei.<br/>
Aigis: But visitors aren't allowed here...<br/>
Junpei: Yeah, but Mitsuru-senpai said that it's okay during the day.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-Persona3-41-244.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Persona3-41-245.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: Who? Ryoji-kun?<br/>
Yukari: Come to think of it, he WAS hitting on Mitsuru-senpai the first time he met her...<br/>
Akihiko: He was...?<br/>
Fuuka: ...but having him around has really cheered up Junpei-kun.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-Persona3-41-250.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Aigis: That's true...I envy you, Junpei.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-Persona3-41-253.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: But you don't seem that different.<br/>
Aigis: However, it is more accurate to say that I am "functioning" as opposed to living. There are times when I malfunction, but I can always be repaired.<br/>
Junpei: So if we were all like you...we wouldn't have to worry about dying...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-Persona3-41-258.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Persona3-41-259.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-Persona3-41-260.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We all left for our rooms, but on the way I heard Aigis mumbling...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-Persona3-41-261.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Aigis: A "living" weapon is difficult to operate...however, I believe I understand the concept of loss. Should you ever be harmed, Minato, I...you are very special to me. I do not know why, but I always want to be by your side. I want to protect you...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Persona3-41-270.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Persona3-41-271.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I dunno what's up with her today.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Persona3-41-273.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I heard her mumbling to herself as I went upstairs, too.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-Persona3-41-274.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Aigis: I am a machine...I cannot die, so they won't have to grieve for me. I must do something...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-Persona3-41-278.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Great, the battle droid's having an existential crisis. My life is a goddamn mess.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-Persona3-41-279.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day, I hung out with Chihiro after school.<br/>

As we got ready to head to the bookstore...<br/>

<br/>
...a couple of students stopped us, and they looked pretty pissed with Chihiro.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>Chihiro: Oh, that money...I gave it to the teacher in the office...<br/>
Girl: You were the one who was responsible for that money, right? That means you were the last one who saw it...<br/>
Chihiro: Huh? I just told you...<br/>
Boy: You're the Treasurer, right? Why are you in that position if you don't know how to handle money properly? The teachers are in the office right now, so why don't you go fess up and apologize...</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>Chihiro: You agree with me, right, Minato-san? It's NOT my fault! I-I gave the money to the teacher! It's not my fault, so why should I have to apologize?<br/>
Boy: ...Whatever. Just make sure you take care of it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="113-Persona3-41-298.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Boy: Don't worry. I'll keep your little secret...for now.<br/>
Chihiro: Wait! You think I...? N-nevermind.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="114-Persona3-41-302.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chihiro: I-I couldn't stand up to them, but I didn't take anything! I have to prove to everyone that it wasn't me, so what should I do? I never expected this to happen...Minato-san, what should I do...?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-Persona3-41-312.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-Persona3-41-313.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
She looked like she was about to hyperventilate...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="117-Persona3-41-314.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="118-Persona3-41-315.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-Persona3-41-316.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...but at least my being around seemed to help a little.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-Persona3-41-319.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I ended up heading home instead of going to the bookstore.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Persona3-41-321.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: ...but we don't have any Shadows to kill. Man, this sucks.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-Persona3-41-324.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="123-Persona3-41-325.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="124-Persona3-41-326.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Eh, what am I worried about? Tomorrow's just gonna be another day.<br/>
