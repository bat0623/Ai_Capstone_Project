...<b>was</b> a goddamn mess.<br/>

But no more.<br/>

Everyone will be happy for at least a little while longer. Nobody will hurt anymore, and in the end, it'll be like all of this was just a long, horrible dream.<br/>

I know some people might not agree with my decision...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
...but it was mine to make, and I'm doing what I think is right.<br/>

I'll miss everyone, but I know in my heart that this is saving the world as best I can. To fight against something unstoppable would simply prolong everyone's suffering, and I can't do that.<br/>

<br/>
Not after what everyone's done for me. Not after what I've been through with my friends. I couldn't do that to them. I couldn't let them hurt any longer. So I followed Junpei's advice, and did what'll make everyone happy.<br/>

Thanks for all the memories, guys. We've come so far together, and now it's time to say farewell. Mitsuru was right...we all need to make some changes in our lives, and this is the change I'm choosing to make. I want everyone to have a chance to be normal, at least for awhile...so this is my gift to all of you.<br/>

I wonder if we'll see each other in Heaven? I wonder if we'll be allowed to remember there...that'd be only fair, wouldn't it? If we're finally going to be happy, that's what should happen...maybe I'll even get to see Bebe, Maiko, Chihiro, Mamoru, and all the others again after the Fall. That'd be nice.<br/>

<br/>
...Well, I hope so, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Goodbye, everyone.
