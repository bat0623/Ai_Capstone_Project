		<b>Entry Thirty-Seven: November 8th, 2009</b><br/><br/>
<b>Mood:</b> <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-gonk.gif"/> Freaked out<br/>
<b>Music:</b> The Exorcist soundtrack<br/>
<br/>
Things just get weirder and weirder...weirder than usual, even. The Dark Hour's still here, there are still Shadows on the loose, and whatever the "Fall" is, it's getting closer every day.<br/>
<br/>
And we haven't even gotten to my goddamn mess of a life yet.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-Persona3-37-001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Before we talk about that, though, let's talk about other people...specifically Yukari, who I had a vision about Thursday night.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Persona3-37-002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And before your mind leaps into the gutter, no, it wasn't that kind of vision. I saw her watching the video Fuuka had given her earlier that evening. Turns out it was the unedited version of the video we'd seen during summer vacation.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Persona3-37-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Eiichiro: This experiment should never have been conceived...that's why I had to interrupt it. However, in doing so, I set free a number of Shadows that are certain to torment future generations. If I hadn't, the  entire world may have paid the price...please, listen carefully...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Persona3-37-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Well shit.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Persona3-37-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Eiichiro: I wasn't able to stop this madness. He won't listen, no matter what I say...he's under the devil's spell. Now the Shadows are trying to eat one another...but if they're reunited, then we are all doomed!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Persona3-37-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Shit, shit, shit.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Persona3-37-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: Dad tried to stop the experiment.<br/>
Eiichiro: There's not much hope for me now. I have just one favor to ask. Whoever finds this...please...give my daughter Yukari this message...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Persona3-37-020.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Persona3-37-021.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Persona3-37-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: ...Dad...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Persona3-37-025.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Persona3-37-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The video ended with an enormous explosion...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Persona3-37-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: I was right to believe in him. ...Are you listening, Dad? I'm doing okay. It took awhile, but I finally got your message.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Persona3-37-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Her renewed faith in her father sparked her spirit once more...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Persona3-37-033.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Persona3-37-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and her Persona evolved to reflect that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Persona3-37-035.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Persona3-37-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That vision faded...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Persona3-37-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...but at the Dark Hour that night...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Persona3-37-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...I had another. I found myself in the Velvet Room.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Persona3-37-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Igor: Now, then. There has been a change in you recently. Have you noticed? I am not referring to your change in circumstances; I am referring to the change in your mentality. That is why I have summoned you here tonight. Going forward, there is one thing you mustn't forget...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Persona3-37-047.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Persona3-37-048.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Persona3-37-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Igor: There is no need to worry. Whichever path you choose, I shall respect your decision. However, only you will bear the responsibility for your actions...no matter what end they may bring about. Please remember that.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Persona3-37-055.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That vision ended as well, and I awoke.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Persona3-37-056.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
After school the next day, Junpei went to visit Chidori.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Persona3-37-057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: A lot's been goin' on.<br/>
Chidori: ...<br/>
Junpei: Hey, what's wrong? ...So you heard about Jin and Takaya, huh? I was planning on telling you...they were your friends, after all. What, that's not it?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Persona3-37-065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chidori: Junpei...what will you be doing in two years?<br/>
Junpei: Two years? I dunno. I really haven't thought about it. Why do you ask?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Persona3-37-071.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Persona3-37-072.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chidori: Oh, I guess.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Persona3-37-074.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Persona3-37-076.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to...<br/>
Chidori: This is too painful...it used to be fun when you came to visit...but it's different now.<br/>
Junpei: Huh?!<br/>
Chidori: It hurts inside...I can't breathe...I...I can't take this anymore!<br/>
Junpei: Wh-whaddya mean?! I don't understand! Did I do something wrong?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Persona3-37-086.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Persona3-37-087.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: But...Chidori...</i><br/>
<br/>
He left her alone, his head hung.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Persona3-37-094.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
As for me, I hung out with Kenji that day.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Persona3-37-095.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Kenji: Dude, listen to this. I've got a serious problem.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Persona3-37-100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I tried to take a jab at Kenji to lighten him up a little, and told him it was a bridal magazine.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Persona3-37-102.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I discovered I was right. Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Persona3-37-104.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Kenji: I made up my mind, man. As soon as I graduate, I'm gonna marry Emiri. I'm seriously in love with Emiri, and I'm gonna marry her!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Persona3-37-112.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Persona3-37-113.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
See what I mean? Weird.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Persona3-37-118.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Persona3-37-119.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And that's not even counting the mysterious inner voices that reward me with magical powers for hanging out with this psychopath.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Persona3-37-120.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Persona3-37-121.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Persona3-37-122.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
My life is a goddamn mess.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Persona3-37-125.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Persona3-37-126.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Persona3-37-127.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
At the dorm that night, I got the usual call from Elizabeth about more of Tartarus having opened up. This seemed odd - hadn't we gotten to the top last time?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Persona3-37-131.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I was curious to see what had happened, so that night at the Dark Hour we were off.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Persona3-37-132.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
As usual, I added a few new Personas to my repertoire before heading inside. First off, I made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrones" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Throne</a>, who was apparently an angel but didn't really look the part. Throne had Hama skills, which had their uses, I guess, but mostly I made him to fill the Compedium a bit more.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Persona3-37-137.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Loki</a>, on the other hand, was much more useful; he's got a variety of elemental skills and resistances, something that's actually becoming less common as I obtain more powerful Personas.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Persona3-37-138.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okuninushi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Okuninushi</a> was actually too weak for me, I made him as part of a fusion instead...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Persona3-37-139.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...in particular, the fusion to create <a href="http://www.popanime.net/megami/wiki/index.php?title=Arahabaki" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Arahabaki</a>, the most powerful Hermit Persona.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Persona3-37-140.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Arahabaki's only weakness is Strike attacks, and he's strong against Fire, Electricity, Light, and Darkness. He also learned Tetrakarn, which reflects physical attacks back to their source, to make up for that weakness; not to mention he can also become immune to Ice with his final skill. Definitely a nice Persona to have around; I'd thank Maya if I could do so without her freaking out.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Persona3-37-142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Another complex fusion yielded <a href="http://www.popanime.net/megami/wiki/index.php?title=Daisoujou_/_High_Priest" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Daisoujou</a>...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Persona3-37-143.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...whose claim to fame was the skill Samsara. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Persona3-37-145.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Samsara is similar to Hama and its ilk, but is extremely accurate, making it great against regular Shadows as it can wipe out entire groups instantly.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Persona3-37-147.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Speaking of new Personas, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Isis</a>, Yukari's evolved Persona, was basically more of the same. It was less horrifying than the woman chained to a cow skull, I guess...well, now it's just a cow skull with a woman's face and wings, so not much has changed if you think about it. Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Persona3-37-148.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
When we reached the floor that we'd thought was the top, we were surprised to find a staircase there waiting for us out of nowhere.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Persona3-37-149.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Persona3-37-150.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We ascended and found ourselves in the fifth block, Harabah, which was dark save for the walls and floor giving off scintilating colors. It was difficult to find our way around and avoid Shadows, so we relied mostly on Fuuka's map to guide our way.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Persona3-37-151.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Persona3-37-152.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
There's plenty of treasure up here...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Persona3-37-154.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and more new Shadows. The Imprudent Maya is just begging for Akihiko to fry it into oblivion...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Persona3-37-155.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...while Samsra annihilates the Kaiden Musha without my having to lift a finger. It's great.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Persona3-37-156.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Persona3-37-157.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next Guardian we came across wasn't nearly as easy, though.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3200312891547522423&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tartarus Boss 16 - Judgment Swords</a> (<i>I probably could've handled this fight with a bit more class, but eh. These guys use Lightning skills almost exclusively, mixing in a sword attack here and there. Yukari will inevitably get toasted, and it's not worth the effort to bring her back; even without her, though, support skills can keep this battle under control without too much muss and fuss.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
The others were exhausted after that, so we headed home for the night.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Persona3-37-163.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day, I hung out with Fuuka after school.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Persona3-37-164.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: That's why I want to know what your favorite food is, so I could make it for you. But everything I make still tastes terrible...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Persona3-37-172.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh come on, Fuuka, let's think positive!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Persona3-37-173.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Or not. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-smith.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: I'm really thankful to be a member of SEES. Everyone's been so encouraging...especially you, Minato-kun. That's why I want to show you my gratitude.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Persona3-37-180.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Persona3-37-181.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Show me her gratitude, eh...?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Persona3-37-182.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Persona3-37-183.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-Persona3-37-184.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I've really gotta keep my hormones under control until the world is saved, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: Maybe I should watch one of those cooking shows on TV...then again, they're probably too advanced for me. Maybe I should just get a cookbook...but there probably aren't any in the library.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Persona3-37-193.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We went to look around Bookworms for awhile, and I introduced Fuuka to Bunkichi and Mitsuko while I was there. They were doing fine as always.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Persona3-37-198.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Today, though...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-Persona3-37-199.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...I went to go see Akinari.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Persona3-37-200.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: I've been waiting. I finished my story and wanted to show it to you. As you know, I was having a lot of trouble with the ending, but I finally figured it out. Since the alligator ate his friend the bird, he cried and cried for a very long time. In fact, he was so sad that he drowned in his own tears.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Persona3-37-212.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: The other animals in the forest came there often to relax, but none of them knew the alligator had created it or that he was gone. The end.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Persona3-37-216.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: Even though the alligator did not find meaning in his life, the residents of the forest did. They just didn't realize it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Persona3-37-219.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: It's really what others think of my life or what I was able to do for them.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Persona3-37-221.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: People can't survive without help from others. We all depend on one another.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Persona3-37-226.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Persona3-37-222.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Persona3-37-223.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I took the notebook; it was filled with writing in Akinari's signature red ink.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-Persona3-37-229.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Persona3-37-230.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: Coming to see me, talking...even discussing the meaning of life...I...I can be glad that I was born...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Persona3-37-235.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-Persona3-37-236.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The wind picked up a slight chill...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-Persona3-37-237.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-Persona3-37-238.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and the sun seemed to glow a bit brighter.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Persona3-37-241.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-Persona3-37-242.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Akinari discovered the meaning of his life, however brief; it's my job to make sure others survive to do the same. (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asura" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Asuras</a> are power-seeking dieties from Hindu mythology.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-Persona3-37-243.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
As we spoke, Akinari began to grow faint.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-Persona3-37-244.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Not his voice or anything...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Persona3-37-245.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...he actually started to seem less consistent.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-Persona3-37-246.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-Persona3-37-248.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
All of a sudden, he vanished right then and there.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Persona3-37-250.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I was left with nothing but his old notebook.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know who, or what, he was, or where he went...but I'm glad I could help him, and I hope that I can do the same for the rest of the world. First, though, we have to find out what exactly we CAN do for the world.<br/>
<br/>
See what I mean about weird? Anyway, I'm out for now, guys, I'll write again later on.<br/>
