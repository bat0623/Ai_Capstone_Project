<b>Mood:</b> <img alt="" border="0" src="1-confused.gif"/> Confused<br/>

<br/>
Y'know, it's been a few weeks now, and I have to admit that I'm still completely confused with what's going on at this point. I guess it's pointless to think about it too hard, but still...we know so little about Tartarus and the Dark Hour.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Persona3-24-001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...anyway, it's been more of the same since the last time I wrote, minus the horrible tank monsters. I've been playing a lot of Innocent Sin Online with Maya, for instance.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Persona3-24-002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: i'm not even complaining today or ne thing...so rare =P but i have to tell tatsu cuz he's my MMO partner! i'll be brave -_-;;</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Persona3-24-006.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Persona3-24-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: oh noes...now i'm starting to get sweaty... =/</i><br/>
<br/>
I went ahead and greeted her.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Persona3-24-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: i wanted to tell u last time but i chickened out...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Persona3-24-014.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Persona3-24-015.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...oh my jesus. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-doh.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Persona3-24-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: none of the male teachers r even in my league, so i gave up looking for b/fs @ work...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Persona3-24-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Isn't that, y'know, <b>illegal</b>? Holy shit.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Persona3-24-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Against my better judgment, I asked what the student she was interested in was like.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Persona3-24-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: i luuuuv watchin his expressions in class. xD is that bad? he's one of my students! =x</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Persona3-24-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
W-wait, that sounded oddly familiar...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Persona3-24-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...oh no.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: oh btw, u don't need to be jealous he's just someone i like, rite? tatsuya is the only game partner for maya ^^; no worries</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Persona3-24-031.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Persona3-24-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Please, please tell me this isn't what I think it is.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Persona3-24-033.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Persona3-24-034.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Persona3-24-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Please?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Persona3-24-037.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Persona3-24-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...my life is <b>SUCH A GODDAMN MESS.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Persona3-24-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I spent the rest of the day feeling nauseous, and that night at the Dark Hour Pharos showed up again, which didn't help much.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Persona3-24-043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Pharos: The end won't be brought about by anyone in particular...it's coming because there are so many people who wish for it...as if it was destined from the start. But doesn't that seem like a strange thing to wish for?</i><br/>
<br/>
I figured nobody would actually want that, and said so.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Persona3-24-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Pharos: What about those who wish for an end to their suffering, who wish to find peace? Well, enough about that for now. There's something else I wanted to tell you today.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Persona3-24-052.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Persona3-24-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Pharos: I don't know whether or not this has anything to do with the end, but you should be careful. I'll come again if I find out anything useful. That's what friends are for, right?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Persona3-24-057.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Persona3-24-058.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure friends don't mysteriously appear in each others' rooms and terrify each other with cryptic messages...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Persona3-24-059.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Persona3-24-060.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Persona3-24-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...but whatever.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Persona3-24-064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day, I got the standard call from Elizabeth about more of Tartarus being unlocked...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Persona3-24-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and right after that, Mitsuru came knocking on my door.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Persona3-24-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It wasn't anything hot, like I'd hoped. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-smith.gif"/> Hell, I'd take Bebe over a creepy middle-aged Internet woman...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: There's something I need to tell everyone, but I think it would be best if you saw it for yourself. Come to the fourth floor meeting room when you get home tonight, okay? I'll see you then.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Persona3-24-075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It's not like I was going out, anyway...I felt like playing some Innocent Sin Online instead. God knows why. There was a system message when I logged on, though...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Persona3-24-076.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Persona3-24-077.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>We are terribly sorry for any inconvenience this causes for active players. However, the servers will remain open until the official end date. We hope that you understand and that you enjoyed your time with "Innocent Sin." Sincerely, "Innocent Sin" staff.</i><br/>
<br/>
That sucks. I logged onto the game after reading the message.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Persona3-24-085.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: it said their cancelling innocent sin. ...think its for real?</i><br/>
<br/>
I was pissed about it, and she seemed to be too.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Persona3-24-089.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: i finally found a place to let out my frustration and now this!!! tatsuya...do u think we'll still be able to see each other? T_T we can meet each other in different ways I guess &gt;_&gt;</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Persona3-24-096.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I'm gonna take a pass on that latter option...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: NO! we have to stop wasting our tiem! maya's not goin quietly! &gt;=/ i'll beat them to the punch! ...oh dun worry tatsu. i won't do nething dangerous &gt;_&gt;</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Persona3-24-103.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: if they knwo this game is important to us, maybe they'll reconsider =D even tho tatsuya's just some lonely kid and maya likes to bitch too much...that shouldn't matter!!!1 (to tell u the truth, i kinda hope ur a handsome guy tho...)</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Persona3-24-108.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Well, that's nice of her...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Persona3-24-111.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Persona3-24-112.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and at least she doesn't seem to have any idea who I am.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Persona3-24-113.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Persona3-24-114.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Persona3-24-115.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Thank God for that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Persona3-24-116.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: don't mess w/maya &amp; friends or u'll regret it! MwahAHaHhaHa! next time we'll celebrate our victory, k? bai!</i><br/>
<br/>
By the time I logged off, it was already time to meet up in the command room.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Persona3-24-120.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: I dunno. But the alarm's not ringin'...<br/>
Yukari: Huh?!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Persona3-24-123.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Persona3-24-124.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: Are you okay?! Where'd you get this collar?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Persona3-24-127.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...an Evoker for dogs.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Persona3-24-128.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: It was a surprise for me as well. But according to the tests, it's quite possible. In fact, it was the Chairman's suggestion. ...We'll be looking after him here in the dorm.<br/>
Fuuka: Is that okay with you, Koro-chan?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Persona3-24-132.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I don't even know what to think anymore.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Persona3-24-133.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: Man, you're one loyal dog.<br/>
Koromaru: Woof!<br/>
Junpei: Hey, make yourself at home...the more the merrier, right? Who cares if you're a dog?! Alright, I'll take him for a walk. It's summer break, after all!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Persona3-24-139.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Persona3-24-140.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Persona3-24-141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Wait, <i>what?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Persona3-24-142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: Oh, it's no joke. We'll be taking intensive courses. I've already applied for all of us. I know how difficult it's been balancing school and our late night excursions...you haven't had much time to study. I apologize for that. That's why the Chairman agrees that this is a good idea. ...I thought I told Takeba and Yamagishi.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Persona3-24-148.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: Umm, sorry...I forgot to mention it.<br/>
Junpei: Aw, man!!<br/>
Yukari: Hey, with your grades, you shuold be thanking her!<br/>
Junpei: Yeah, right. This sucks...don't you think, Minato?</i><br/>
<br/>
Hell yeah it sucked. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-smith.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Persona3-24-156.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
So it's not like I really had a choice in the matter. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-smith.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Persona3-24-180.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Koro uses knives in combat by holding them in his mouth; none of us have any training with them, so they're unique to him. I tried using one once and nearly lost a finger, so I'll just leave the stabbing to the dog. Koro's armor is also unique to him, though I guess that's pretty obvious. He can't use any footwear, but he's pretty evasive without it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Persona3-24-181.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Koro's Persona is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerberus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cerberus</a>, which makes a hilarious kind of sense. Cerberus resists Darkness AND Fire attacks, which definitely makes up for its weakness to Light. Koro's better at using Fire attacks than Junpei (<i>Yet ANOTHER time the guy is completely outclassed by someone else</i>) and also has some instant death Darkness attacks. Koro's smart about using those - he'll usually go with Fire or physical attacks unless he knows the enemy is weak to Darkness.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Persona3-24-164.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day was Sunday, so I decided to head down to the shrine. I ran into Striped Shirt there.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Persona3-24-165.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Striped Shirt: The me that I see reflected in your eyes and the real me, if there is such a thing...how far apart are they? Your words are very beautiful...if I had something to write with, I'd write them down.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Persona3-24-172.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Striped Shirt: My pen is my supporter, my spokesman, and my friend. However, it seems to have disappeared. Without it, my screams are silenced.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Persona3-24-178.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
White fur and bright red eyes, huh...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Persona3-24-185.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Summer school started the next day...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Persona3-24-188.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and continued through the week.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Persona3-24-189.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mr. Edogawa: You must all be very curious students to be taking this course over the summer. I'm not really sure what to make of that, eeheehee. Well, let's talk about something interesting today. All you future magicians will want to pay close attention, eeheehee...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Persona3-24-194.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mr. Edogawa: Originating in 15th century Europe as normal playing cards, tarot cards evolved into tools of divination. A variety of different versions of tarot card decks exist, including the Marseille and Rider decks...but today, in respect of the great magician Crowley, we will be using the Thoth deck. First, let's talk about the composition of the deck...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Persona3-24-199.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Persona3-24-200.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mr. Edogawa: The Major Arcana feature a variety of illustrations on their faces. Beginning with "The Fool" and ending with "The World", they tell a story in numerical order that is a metaphor of an individual's journey through life. Each Major Arcana represents a stage on that journey, an exerpeience that one must incorporate to realize his oneness. They're all important, so let's take a look at each of the 22 cards, one by one.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-00_-_The_Fool.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
The first card, numbered 0, is <b>The Fool</b>. It represents the beginning and suggests infinite possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-01_-_The_Magician.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
The next card, <b>The Magician</b>, represents action and initiative...but also immaturity.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-02_-_The_Priestess.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>The Priestess</b> represents contemplation and inner knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-03_-_The_Empress.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>The Empress</b> represents motherhood and the life it brings forth.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-04_-_The_Emperor.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>The Emperor</b> is an opposing card. It represents fathering and relates to leadership and decision-making skills.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-05_-_The_Hierophant.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>The Hierophant</b> represents formality and knowledge, and stands for religion.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-06_-_The_Lovers.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>The Lovers</b> represents choice. Here, the individual's consciousness has finally surfaced.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-07_-_The_Chariot.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>The Chariot</b> represents victory for the individual, but only a momentary one.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-08_-_Justice.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Justice</b> represents the knowledge of what is right and what is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-09_-_The_Hermit.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>The Hermit</b> represents the individual's search for answers by looking inward, deep inside his heart.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-10_-_Fortune.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Fortune</b> represents fate, and the opportunities that come with it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-11_-_Strength.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Strength</b> represents both passion and self-control. It is depicted as power with reason.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-12_-_The_Hanged_Man.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>The Hanged Man</b> reflects the individual's inability to take action.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-13_-_Death.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
Spiritual death awaits the individual with the thirteenth card, which is aptly named <b>Death</b>. Death is considered a transitional card: the old ends, and the new begins.<br/>
<br/>
Now let us continue along the path, following the transition.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-14_-_Temperance.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Temperance</b> is the balancing of opposites. Opening his eyes to the world allows the individual to grow...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-15_-_The_Devil.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
...and as <b>The Devil</b> represents, he then faces temptation.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-16_-_The_Tower.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
At <b>The Tower</b>, his values collapse on him. It seems as if he no longer has anything to believe in, but...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-17_-_The_Star.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
...he then finds a glimmer of hope, represented by <b>The Star</b>, and he is suffused with a serene calm.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-18_-_The_Moon.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
This bliss makes him vulnerable to the illusions of <b>The Moon</b>. Fears arise, and he follows the dim path in his heart with trepidation...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-19_-_The_Sun.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
...but he is rewarded with a bright future, represented by <b>The Sun</b>, which signifies true achievement.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-20_-_Judgement.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<b>Judgement</b> awaits the individual at the end of his journey, as he looks back on the path he has travelled.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-21_-_The_World.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
The final card is <b>The World</b>, which represents the individual's full awareness of his place in the world.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-Persona3-24-234.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-Persona3-24-242.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I felt pretty enlightened by that lecture, I guess since it seemed to relate to our Peronas and the Shadows that we fought.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-Persona3-24-243.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
A couple days later, I had Mr. Edogawa's class again...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Persona3-24-244.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mr. Edogawa: Now let's continue with our special summer study - The Truth Behind Magic.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-Persona3-24-247.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mr. Edogawa: I assume all of you have at least heard of Kabbalah, yes? It is    known as the mystical study of the Hebrew scriptures, but... as I have mentioned before, it has had a great impact on western sorcery. It has been said that to learn the secrets of magic, first you must truly understand Kabbalah. So, who was the person who formed this incredible ideology known as Kabbalah?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-Persona3-24-253.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Persona3-24-254.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mr. Edogawa: But in reality, it was formulated by a group of rabbis long, long ago. However, because it consists of such a complicated coded system...Kabbalah did not become known to the western world until much later.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Persona3-24-258.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mr. Edogawa: For example, there is "Gematria," the interpretation of text by replacing letters with the numbers they represent. There is "Notarikon," where you take a letter from each word to form another sentence or thought. There is also "Temurah," a method where letters of words are replaced, thereby giving the sentence a new meaning. All these different methods make it difficult to fully comprehend Kabbalah.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Persona3-24-263.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mr. Edogawa: Most illustrations depict it as a chart shaped like a tree. The 10 stages represented by the Sefirot...and the 22 paths connecting them represent the stages of Creation God formed from his own self, as well as the direction in which humanity should evolve. Where did we come from? Where are we going? These answers lie in the Sefirot.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-Persona3-24-271.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-Persona3-24-273.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-Persona3-24-274.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Class kept on going, but this wasn't as interesting as learning about the Arcana, so I stopped paying attention.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-Persona3-24-276.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Finally, summer school was over.<br/>

<br/>
Back at the dorm that evening, I found Koromaru holding on to something...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="111-Persona3-24-281.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...which turned out to be the striped shirt guy's pen. I'll have to give it back the next time I see him.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
After finding the pen, I went to see Mutatsu.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: Ugh, I'm in bad shape...I completely forgot I have a memorial service to conduct...reciting the Heart Sutra with a hangover, ugh. Before, no matter how much I drank, all I needed was a cold shower to snap outta it.Guess I'm gettin' old, heh...it's times like these I wish I didn't live alone.</i><br/>
<br/>
I asked him about the other monks, since it seemed odd that there weren't any.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: If ya think about it, livin' alone's probably the best thing a person could do...you don't hafta wait for someone else to get otuta the bathroom when ya need to go. My son took forever in there. Yeah, livin' alone is the way to achieve peace and serenity. All things visible are bound to change and disappear...all things in this world are not singular. They're all smaller parts of a bigger picture. And yet, they're all different from each other. All things in this world are unique.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-Persona3-24-304.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: No matter how hard you try to live your life right, someone else can always mess it up. All things are unique, yet they are not singular...maybe you've messed up my life a bit, too. Heheheh...</i><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Mutatsu's pretty deep for an old drunk guy.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Maybe alcohol's how you become enlightened. I gotta keep that in mind.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yesterday was the day of the Summer Festival. Yuko called and asked if I wanted to go with her; sounded like fun, so I accepted.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-Persona3-24-329.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The Summer Festival is pretty popular here, but I guess it's the same everywhere in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="123-Persona3-24-330.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Some of the girls here wore yukatas, but Yuko isn't a big fan of them. I told her I thought she'd look good in one.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We got some takoyaki...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="126-Persona3-24-357.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...took a look at a mask salesman's display...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="127-Persona3-24-363.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and played a game of Luck Draw.<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="129-Persona3-24-372.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I ended up winning a nice stuffed Jack Frost doll, so that was pretty cool. Jack Frost is awesome.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="130-Persona3-24-379.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
All in all, it was a good time all around...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="131-Persona3-24-382.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and summer vacation's not even close to over yet. Confusing as it might be, and despite the fact that it's a goddamn mess, life is going pretty well right now, guys. Wish me luck that it stays that way, and I'll talk to you all later!<br/>
