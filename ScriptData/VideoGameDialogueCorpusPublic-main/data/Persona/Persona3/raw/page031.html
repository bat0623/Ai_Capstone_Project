		<b>Entry Twenty-Six: September 4th, 2009</b><br/><br/>
<b>Mood:</b> <img alt="" border="0" src="1-emot-crying.gif"/> Nervous<br/>
<b>Music:</b> Bullet for My Valentine<br/>
<br/>
You know, before every full moon I get a little nervous. Sure, we've been getting more and more powerful as time goes on, but I still worry that we might eventually run into a Shadow that's just too much for us. Once again, all I can really do is blog to chill out...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Persona3-27-001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I mentioned it in my last entry, but school's started up again. I'm thrilled about it, as I'm sure you can imagine. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-smith.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Persona3-27-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
People were already gossiping as I headed in to school.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Listener: Yeah...I'm in no mood to be here. I just want to turn around and head back to bed...<br/>
Gossip: Heh, you might come down with that Apathy Syndrome...then you wouldn't have to worry about anything.<br/>
Listener: Nooo! Are you kidding me?! Although, come to think of it, it doesn't sound so bad. Maybe I'll try it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Persona3-27-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Class was thrilling as always...well, integrative learning is actually enjoyable, but this physics crap isn't.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Persona3-27-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
After class that day, I went to go hang out with Kenji.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Persona3-27-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Or I tried to, anyway. He stopped at the gate.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Persona3-27-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Kenji: I forgot I have to go check out that cram school today, so I don't have time to eat ramen. Sorry, man.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Persona3-27-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I slowly and carefully reached for my Evoker. Those damn Shadows had replaced Kenji with a poorly-made clone!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Persona3-27-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...oh, wait, he was just being an idiot over that teacher again.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kenji: But the future's a long way off, dude. I mean, first I have to go to college, right? All of Emiri's students go to good colleges. She must be thinking about our future together...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Persona3-27-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I wanted to mention that if I didn't go kill demons on a biweekly basis he and everyone else would likely not have a future, but I kept my mouth shut.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Persona3-27-034.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Persona3-27-036.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Persona3-27-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ever since all this started, I've really been more concerned matters of the present, like "not dying"...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Persona3-27-038.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Persona3-27-039.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Persona3-27-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...but maybe Kenji's got a point. I thought about it on the way back to the dorm.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Persona3-27-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yukari greeted me when I got there.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: Hey, Fuuka, is Aigis ready?<br/>
Junpei: Ready for what?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Persona3-27-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: But the Chairman overheard and thought it was a good idea. So as of tomorrow, she'll be a junior.<br/>
Junpei: Seriously?! He's down with that?!<br/>
Fuuka: He said something about studying her behavior in a social environment...<br/>
Junpei: Well, as far as I'm concerned, it's a great idea...just look at how cute she is in that unifrom!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Persona3-27-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
She's a ROBOT, dude...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Ken: It looks very natural on you; no one will suspect a thing. But why does he want you to go to school? it's not like there's anything special about it.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Persona3-27-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Aigis: If I were to remain here on standby, it could delay our deployment. Therefore, I request to accompany our squad leader.<br/>
Yukari: Delay our deployment? Won't you going to school create more problems?<br/>
Aigis: I will make any necessary adjustments as problems arise.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Persona3-27-059.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Persona3-27-060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: Sorry, Koro-chan...you have to stay here.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Persona3-27-062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Aigis: I have a question, Minato-san. Why can't Koromaru-san attend school? I do not understand why I am permitted to go to school while Koromaru-san is not. Nowhere in the school regulations does it state that canines are prohibited from attending school.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Persona3-27-068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
So the next day was Aigis' first day in class.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Persona3-27-071.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Persona3-27-073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ms. Toriumi: Aigis...what a strange name. I wonder if she was born overseas. Let's see...anything else I should know? Hm? Humanoid tactical weapon? What on Earth...? Clearly that's a mistake. It just goes to show that you can't believe everything you read...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Persona3-27-078.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Uh, Ms. Toriumi, that spot's already taken. He's just playin' hookey.<br/>
Ms. Toriumi: ...which means he's not here. So it's free to be used, right?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Persona3-27-082.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Persona3-27-083.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Persona3-27-084.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yukari didn't seem to like that very much...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Aigis: Is there a problem?<br/>
Classmate: Um, Yukari, why are you standing up?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Persona3-27-087.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ms. Toriumi: Do me a favor and save the antics for after school.</i><br/>
<br/>
Ms. Toriumi didn't seem to like it much either - there was something in her eye when she mentioned "drama". It couldn't be...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Persona3-27-089.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
At lunchtime that day, I got a text message from Akihiko.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Akihiko: I have something important to take care of after school. I want you to come. I'll be waiting by the gate, so meet me there.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Persona3-27-096.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
So that's where I went once classes were over.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Akihiko: There's something I have to do, and I want you to come with me. We're going to get someone. ...An old member.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Persona3-27-100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We went to Hagakure, and who did we run into but Shinjiro?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Persona3-27-101.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Shinjiro: What?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Persona3-27-103.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akihiko: We have a new enemy. They're Persona-users, like us.<br/>
Shinjiro: Yeah, so what?<br/>
Akihiko: There's more. Ken Amada has joined our team.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Persona3-27-108.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akihiko: He has the Potential, and Ikutsuki-san has okayed it. He's now a Persona-user.<br/>
Shinijro: You've gotta be kidding me...let me ask you one thing. Was it his decision to join SEES?<br/>
Akihiko: Yeah. He volunteered.<br/>
Shinjiro: I see.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Persona3-27-117.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
He then turned to me.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Shinjiro: So you're the one leading the operations now, huh? If you don't mind me asking, what exactly are you fighting for?</i><br/>
<br/>
Well...to be honest, I fight for everyone. My life might be a goddamn mess, but at least nobody else's will be if I keep doing my best.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Persona3-27-121.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Shinjiro: Well, you do your thing; I'll do mine. Is my room still vacant?</i><br/>
<br/>
I wanted to see what Shinjiro could do, but that night we were busy getting him set up back at the dorm, so I went to Mandragora instead. The next night, though...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Persona3-27-132.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Persona3-27-133.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Shinjiro: Don't worry...I got your back.</i><br/>
<br/>
...he was ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Persona3-27-136.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Shinjiro uses heavy weapons like axes and maces. They're even less accurate than Junpei's swords, but man, when he hits, he hits <b>hard</b>.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Persona3-27-137.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Shinjiro's Persona is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castor_and_Pollux" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Castor</a>, the Gemini counterpart to Akihiko's Polydeuces. Castor is non-elemental and focuses on physical skills; Shinjiro also regenerates HP every turn and can counter physical attacks; all in all he's way better at the whole physical damage thing than Junpei, Akihiko, or even Aigis, but he can't do much else.<br/>
<br/>
With Shinjiro in tow, we headed off to Tartarus...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Persona3-27-147.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Shinjiro's not exactly diverse, but man can he smash things.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Persona3-27-138.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
With his help, we easily made it to the top of the current block.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Persona3-27-139.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
There was another Old Document there, of course.<br/>
<br/>
<i>I wanted to be with him, so I joined. What a mistake...we shouldn't be experimenting with these "Shadows"...</i><br/>
<br/>
With nothing left to do for the time being, we headed home.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Persona3-27-155.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I had a vision earlier today about Junpei and Chidori.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Persona3-27-156.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Huh? I don't see anything...not even a scar... did it heal that quickly?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Persona3-27-159.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Persona3-27-160.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
You're smooth as always, Junpei.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Persona3-27-161.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: How 'bout you, Chidori? Is that why you draw?<br/>
Chidori: Maybe...but most of these are just scribbles...I don't understand myself that well.<br/>
Junpei: I see. Mind if I sit here?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Persona3-27-167.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Persona3-27-168.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...wait, what?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Persona3-27-169.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...oh no.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Persona3-27-170.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Persona3-27-171.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-doh.gif"/> Junpei, you aren't really supposed to run around telling people about that...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Persona3-27-172.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh, maybe she thought it was just a shitty joke...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Um... you're s'posed to laugh.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Persona3-27-174.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and maybe she's just coming on to him...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: H-hey, I was just kiddin' around...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Persona3-27-176.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...or not. Shit. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-smith.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chidori: So then, no one knows what you've been doing either. That means you'll never recieve any recognition...I'm impressed. I didn't know you were that kind of guy.<br/>
Junpei: For real? You actually believe me?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Persona3-27-182.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Persona3-27-183.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Ya see, there's this special power called "Persona", and only those who have it can defeat the monsters. That's what I meant by "the chosen ones." My friends are fighting, too...and ever since I joined 'em, we've been kicking some serious ass!<br/>
Chidori: Sounds like fun.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Persona3-27-188.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Y-yeah...I-I guess you could say that. I mean, without me, things would just fall apart. Someone's gotta be in charge, after all. it's pretty tough being a leader.<br/>
Chidori: ...</i><br/>
<br/>
Junpei, you lying asshole. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-argh.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Persona3-27-194.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
With that, Chidori stood up to leave.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Y-you did?<br/>
Chidori: It's time for me to go. I'll see you tomorrow, right?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Persona3-27-197.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Persona3-27-198.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...She's just a girl in a weird dress. There's nothing to worry about with her, and besides, we've got bigger problems right now. Hopefully I'll live through those so I can write about them, but for now, see ya!<br/>
<br/>
