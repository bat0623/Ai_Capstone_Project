		<b>Entry Twenty-Five: August 31, 2009</b><br/><br/>
Mood: <img alt="" border="0" src="1-emot-crying.gif"/> Depressed<br/>
Music: My own sobbing!<br/>
<br/>
School's starting up again! Why, god, why?! Only blogging can take my mind off the impending homework, boring lectures, and classes with a teacher twice my age who admitted having a crush on me over the Internet...well, I hope it can, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Persona3-26x-001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I had a vision on Monday; it was the typical Akihiko/Shinjiro stuff where Akihiko was trying to get his counterpart to rejoin SEES. Turns out Ken was there, too, listening in...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Persona3-26x-002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Shinjiro: Well, the answer's still the same: I'm not coming back.<br/>
Akihiko: You know, another new Persona-user joined us...and he's not human.<br/>
Shinjiro: ...What?<br/>
Akihiko: It's a dog. He lost his master six months ago because of the Shadows. He's incredibly loyal...up 'til now, he's been guarding the spot where his master was killed despite the bad memories.<br/>
Shinjiro: ...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Persona3-26-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akihiko: But it's been two years since then...<br/>
Shinjiro: ...<br/>
Akihiko: How long do you plan to beat yourself up over it? You're always at that spot behind the station, even though you don't hang out with the crowd there.<br/>
Shinjiro: It doesn't matter.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Persona3-26-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Shinjiro: What difference does it make if I come to terms with it? It won't change anything. This isn't the same as what happened to Miki.<br/>
Akihiko: Shinji...<br/>
Shinjiro: That's enough already. I just want to forget it ever happened.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Persona3-26-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ken: ...it can't be...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Persona3-26-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It was weird, I thought I heard a menacing chill in Ken's voice. Definitely nothing you'd expect from an elementary school student.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I spent the rest of that day doing just about nothing...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Persona3-26-026.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Persona3-26-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ken: Now I know, and I'm ready to do it...my mind is made up.</i><br/>
<br/>
...and talked to Ken the next morning to see what was up. No luck, though.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Persona3-26-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I've been trying to become a bit more tough lately, so I've been eating at Wild-Duck Burger and singing at Mandragora when I can. Seems to be helping.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Persona3-26-031.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Persona3-26-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I also went to see a sports movie marathon with Yuko...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Persona3-26-040.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Persona3-26-041.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...which was pretty inspiring. I need to stop being such a wuss.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Persona3-26-044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I went again the next day with Kaz; they were showing war movies this time.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Persona3-26-050.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Persona3-26-052.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Persona3-26-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Once again, it seemed to help with the whole "being a pussy" thing.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Persona3-26-057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day, Mitsuru came knocking on my door in the morning again...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Persona3-26-060.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Persona3-26-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and again, it wasn't sexual. Damn. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-smith.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: We'll meet on the 4th floor as usual. That's all.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Persona3-26-064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I was on my way to Wild-Duck Burger when I saw Mamoru hanging out at the strip mall, so I stopped to say hi. He invited me to lunch, and I took him up on it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Persona3-26-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
If I was more of a pussy, I would've backed down, but since I'd been eating tons of greasy hamburgers I felt macho enough to go for it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Persona3-26-071.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Persona3-26-072.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
He ate pretty fast, but I started swallowing them whole to keep up.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Persona3-26-076.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Persona3-26-077.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
What a poseur!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Persona3-26-079.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Persona3-26-080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: I'm impressed, Minato! Not many people can match my speed. Well, I wasn't really trying my hardest anyway. You had a lot of guts challenging me at yakoyaki, though...I'm impressed. You have a lot of potential.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Persona3-26-089.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Persona3-26-090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Y'know, I kinda figured I'd get a rival one day since all this started...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Persona3-26-091.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Persona3-26-092.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...but I also figured they'd be the kind who tries to kill me. I guess I lucked out.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Persona3-26-093.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Persona3-26-094.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: You put up a good fight today! See you around.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Persona3-26-097.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That evening, we had our meeting as scheduled. Turns out we were getting yet another new member...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Persona3-26-098.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Persona3-26-099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...though I wasn't sure I felt right about having an elementary school student help us battle demons from beyond time and space.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Akihiko: You must be kidding...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Persona3-26-101.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ikutsuki: I called this meeting so that I could introduce him, since he'll be joining our squad.<br/>
Mitsuru: B-but Mr. Chairman, he's still in elementary school. Besides...<br/>
Ikutsuki: Besides...what? His ability is quite promising. With the proper training, he could be a big help.<br/>
Akihiko: But is HE okay with it?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Persona3-26-108.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ken: I believe I can be of some assistance...now I finally know why I was given this power.<br/>
Ikutsuki: So as you can see, it was his own decision.<br/>
Ken: Nice to meet you all. I'll try not to get in anyone's way.<br/>
Aigis: Nice to meet you, too.[<br/>
Akihiko: ...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Persona3-26-115.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Junpei seemed to be the only one of us who was cool with it...well, other than Aigis, and I think she's programmed to be cool with just about everything that's not a Shadow.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: It may be hard at times, but stick with it.<br/>
Ken: Yes, got it!</i><br/>
<br/>
And that's how a little kid joined our demonslaying team.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Persona3-26-118.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...I'm part of a demonslaying team. And it includes a battle droid, a dog, and a fifth grader. My life is such a goddamn mess.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is Ken. He uses spears which are twice as tall as he is, and he's pretty goddamn good with them, especially given that he's like twelve years old.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Persona3-26-119.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ken's Persona is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemesis_%28mythology%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nemesis</a>, the goddess of revenge. Kind of an odd choice for a little kid, as is the fact that it's a horrible buzzsaw robot monster. Nemesis is strong against Light and weak to Darkness, and has a diverse combination of skills, including physical, lightning, and light attacks along with healing. Ken's trademark skill is Cruel Attack, which does an enormous amount of damage to enemies that are knocked down.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Persona3-26-120.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
With Ken in tow, we headed off to Tartarus that very night. I wanted to see what the kid could do, and man, did he put on a show for us:<br/>
<br/>

<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8885593289602567426&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ken is Awesome 2</a><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Persona3-26-121.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We headed on up the tower, collecting Personas like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flauros" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Flauros</a>...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Persona3-26-122.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Persona3-26-123.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and items along the way.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Persona3-26-124.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Y'know, Ken's Persona freaks me the fuck out. That buzzsaw thing just makes me really nervous.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Persona3-26-126.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Damned if it isn't powerful, though. His lightning attacks put Akihiko's to shame.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Persona3-26-135.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
As you might expect, the buzzsaw itself packs a punch too.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Persona3-26-136.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Persona3-26-139.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Fuuka's been learning new abilities as well, though they weren't exactly world-shaking; Third Eye would tell us if certain attacks would work on targeted enemies, but it'd only do so if we'd already analyzed them, meaning it was convenient and nothing more.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Persona3-26-142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I've been updating my stable of Personas constantly, but I've kept Narcissus around; he's got a great selection of skills, and Sexy Dance is really accurate for something that basically shuts the enemies down.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Persona3-26-143.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Persona3-26-144.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
When we got to the Guardian, I decided to put my new-found courage to the test...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Persona3-26-149.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
First, I fused together a new Persona, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orobas" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Orobas</a>. I was sure his funky dancing skills would see me through!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Persona3-26-150.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It learned Trafuri, which allowed us to escape from battles without fail. I didn't need that for the Guardian, but it'd definitely come in handy later. Anyway, with Orobas, it was time to take on this Guardian <b>alone</b>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3933181616844570065&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tartarus Boss 11 - Natural Dancer</a> (<i>This is probably the single most difficult battle in this game. It uses extremely powerful wind attacks that wreck anyone but Minato and Yukari, and when it's not doing that it spams Sexy Dance to charm anyone who's not dead. It also casts Hamaon, a powerful instant death attack. Oh, and nothing but ice and physical attacks harm it, and it tends to use Tetrakarn to reflect the latter. Keep all this in mind as you watch me make it my bitch in this video.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
I won, of course. Everyone was about as amazed as you'd expect, and we headed back to the dorm victoriously afterward.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Persona3-26-151.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day, I had another vision, this one of Junpei and the strange girl in white.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Persona3-26-152.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Huh? That girl...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Persona3-26-154.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Uh, w-well...I mean, I'm surprised you remember me.<br/>
Girl: Same here...<br/>
Junpei: Well, you kinda stand out in that dress...so what are you drawing?<br/>
Girl: Nothing. Why?<br/>
Junpei: Uhh, no reason...I was just thinking that it must be nice to have something you're really into.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Persona3-26-164.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Oh yeah? Still, I'd like to see it when you're done, okay?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Persona3-26-167.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That day I went to go see Maiko.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Persona3-26-168.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maiko: At least Mom and Dad didn't forget about my birthday this year...they remembered Course nobody could forget me!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Persona3-26-174.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maiko: We used to eat dinner together every night...how come Mom and Dad don't get along anymore?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Persona3-26-178.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maiko: If I can get rid of the reason, everything'll be fine, right? I'm going to do whatever it takes to get my parents back together! You'll do what you can to help, right?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Persona3-26-184.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Persona3-26-185.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Well, you can't exactly say no to something like that...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Persona3-26-186.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Persona3-26-187.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Persona3-26-188.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...though I'm not really sure what I could to do help her.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Persona3-26-192.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I hung out with Mutatsu that evening, though it didn't go anywhere...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Persona3-26-193.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and that night, during the Dark Hour...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Persona3-26-195.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...it was time for another visit from Pharos.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Pharos: Are you ready...? Only a few trials remain...so be careful. I look forward to seeing you again.</i><br/>
<br/>
At least he's not muttering cryptic prophecies lately. Thank God for that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Persona3-26-200.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day was Sunday, so I went to go see Akinari.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Persona3-26-201.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
He seems happy to see me.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Persona3-26-202.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: I didn't expect to see you again. Usually people don't come back. Nobody treats me like a normal guy...not even my family. I can tell by how they look at me. The pity in their eyes is unmistakable. I don't need their sympathy any more than I need their curiosity.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-Persona3-26-210.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: I don't expect anyone to pity me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Persona3-26-212.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I...didn't know, really. I never thought about it that way.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Persona3-26-214.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: ...Hey. Thanks for coming today. You don't seem like everyone else. I'm not sure I know how to describe it exactly, but...you don't look down on me the way everyone else does.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-Persona3-26-221.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Persona3-26-222.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I always feel terrible after hanging out with Akinari.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Persona3-26-223.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Persona3-26-224.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Persona3-26-225.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I know it's not his fault, but I can't help but wish there was something I could do.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Persona3-26-226.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: Dammit...what did I do to deserve this body?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Persona3-26-228.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Persona3-26-229.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Poor guy.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Persona3-26-230.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Poor me, too: today is the last day of summer vacation. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-smith.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-Persona3-26-231.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I had another vision about Junpei and that girl...I'd really rather spend my time living my own last day of vacation than watching someone else's.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Persona3-26-232.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: I'm Junpei. What's your name? You live around here?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Persona3-26-235.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
All of a sudden, Junpei saw a huge bloody gash across the girl's hand.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-Persona3-26-236.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-Persona3-26-237.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Strangely enough, she didn't seem to notice it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-Persona3-26-238.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: C'mon, show me your hand. You need to put some pressure on it.<br/>
Girl: Why are you in such a panic...?<br/>
Junpei: Are you crazy?! Anyone would freak out over this. You need to see a doctor. ...You want me to go with you?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Persona3-26-244.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
There's something really wrong with that chick.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-Persona3-26-245.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-Persona3-26-246.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-Persona3-26-247.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chidori: ...I'm almost done with the picture. I doubt you'll understand it, but if you want to see it, then you know where to find me.</i><br/>
<br/>
And with that, she walked off, blood still oozing from the gaping wound in her hand.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Persona3-26-250.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I was a little shaken up, so I went to hang out with Mamoru; he's a pretty straightforward kind of guy.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-Persona3-26-251.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I said I would, though I wasn't sure why.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-Persona3-26-255.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: It's not fair! Normal people get to eat whatever they want. But if that's what I have to do to win, then...by the way, who do you consider to be your biggest rival?</i><br/>
<br/>
Well, to be honest, I mostly compete with myself most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Persona3-26-260.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: I guess when you get down to it, we're all our own worst enemies, right? You know it! There isn't really anyone left who I want to compete with...the other guys in the club can't even keep up with me. I guess what I'm looking for is a good challenge.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Persona3-26-267.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: I have this feeling we can drive each other to the limit!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Persona3-26-271.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-Persona3-26-272.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Mamoru's actually a pretty cool guy.<br/>
<br/>
