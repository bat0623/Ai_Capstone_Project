Music: More MCR. They're awesome.<br/>
<br/>
Well, things have finally been picking up socially. Seems like everyone was just taking their sweet time to start doing interesting stuff again. I guess I shouldn't complain about boring periods in my life, since they suck less than being eaten by horrible soul-eating monsters.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-Persona3-16-001.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Anyway, time to get into the details of the past few days. On Wednesday, I ran into Junpei before class.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Oh, you noticed it too? She's been thinking way too hard about Tartarus n' stuff. I mean, who cares, right?!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Persona3-16-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And after school that day, I hung out with Yuko. Nothing happened. I figured this would be the start of another boring week...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Persona3-16-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...so that night it was off to Tartarus.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Persona3-16-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We kept climbing up from where we left off, encountering new Shadows along the way. These Maniacal Books were only weak to Dark attacks, and we had none, so they were a pain in the ass to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Persona3-16-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
They also had a very, very irritating tendency to use Spirit Drain to steal our SP. Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Persona3-16-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
These Adamant Beetles were weak to electricity, which both Akihiko and I could dish out in spades. They had a ton of HP, though, so they still took awhile to kill. They also had an extremely dangerous attack called Kill Rush which was capable of taking any of us out in one shot.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Persona3-16-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It wasn't all bad, though. We ran into quite a few rare chests...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Persona3-16-013.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...though the vast majority of them contained more Warrior's Seals. I wasn't even using the first one!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Persona3-16-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
After a battle, I ended up with this pretty, sparkly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Unicorn</a>. I once wished for a planet full of those, did I ever mention that? Well, I guess it's not important now.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Persona3-16-019.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Let's see, what else...oh, we had our first experience with being Charmed during a battle with some Lustful Snakes. I had a bloody lip for awhile after a charmed Akihiko socked me in the face. Fuck Charm.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Persona3-16-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Speaking of those Snakes, here's a better drawing of one.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Persona3-16-021.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Persona3-16-022.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
In another rare chest, we found a Traesto Gem. This was a spectacularly useless item that let us escape from Tartarus whenever we wanted...something we could already do thanks to the abundance of Access Points everywhere. Lame.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Persona3-16-023.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I worked on training my Personas as well - Principality learned Hama, the first Light attack skill. Much like Mudo, Hama would instantly kill enemies I targeted with it, though it didn't hit often.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Persona3-16-024.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Persona3-16-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Personas, I made a few new ones during a break. This guy seemed pretty familiar, for instance. He also let me use a new Fusion...<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7678534132544112968&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Fusion - Jack Brothers</a><br/>
<br/>
It isn't very good. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-smith.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Persona3-16-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh, we got this Toy Bow from fulfilling one of Elizabeth's many requests - I've been doing that, but haven't really mentioned them up until now. To get the Bow, we had to hunt down and kill a rare form of Shadow known as the Wealth Hand. It took awhile to even find one, and even then if we got too close it'd run away and disappear, so I had to sneak up on it with a bow. I made an animation of the last leg of the hunt here:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2527108065509543165&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rare Form - Wealth Hand</a><br/>
<br/>
(<i>Rare Forms show up randomly and rarely, and appear as gold Shadows in Tartarus. They have greatly heightened senses compared to normal Shadows, so it's important to be careful when sneaking up on them, since if they see Minato they'll take off running and disappear. They're easy to take out in combat, though - just have everyone attack with their weapons, and someone's bound to hit its weakness. Upon defeating a Rare Form, you'll get an item Elizabeth is requesting if you need it, or a Coin that sells for a huge chunk of money. They're always worth killing when you see them.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Persona3-16-032.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Persona3-16-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The Toy Bow was surprisingly powerful despite its appearance; I gave it to Yukari.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Persona3-16-029.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Persona3-16-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We were nearing the next Guardian, so I stopped to make a new Persona - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garuda" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gurr</a>, which resisted Wind and had Media due to fusion.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Persona3-16-034.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Persona3-16-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Right before we reached the Guardian, I found a rare chest containing a Homonculus. These are very valuable items - if I'm killed by a Light or Dark attack, the Homonculus dies instead of me. They don't work for the others, but I've been trying to keep them around just in case.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of the Guardian, right after that we reached its floor...<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=651649332716814393&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tartarus Boss 7 - Intrepid Knight</a><br/>
<br/>
(<i>The Intrepid Knight uses a lot of Wind attacks, meaning this is yet another boss that Junpei just has to sit out for - it really seems like the combat designers hated the guy. Fortunately for Minato, we finally have access to some decent Wind-resistant Personas, which we put to liberal use in this battle. Notice the Intrepid Knight's use of Mind Charge - this makes its next magic attack do a little over twice as much damage, so it's important to be careful and keep debuffs/buffs/resistances up.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Persona3-16-036.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Persona3-16-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
After we defeated the Intrepid Knight, we finally ran into the next barricade. We couldn't really do much...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Persona3-16-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...except grab the third Old Document and leave.<br/>
<br/>
<i>They built a research facility here; they want me to join the team, but I have a bad feeling...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Persona3-16-057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
After school the next day, I headed to the Art Club to join up.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Persona3-16-060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
To my surprise, I ran into Fuuka.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Persona3-16-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Glasses Guy: Do you know him, Fuuka-san?<br/>
Fuuka: Yeah, this is the guy I was just telling you about...<br/>
Glasses Guy: Oh, so this is him, huh? You must be Minato-kun. I've heard a lot about you from Fuuka-san!<br/>
Fuuka: We're looking for new members to join our club, so I mentioned your name. I'm really happy you decided to stop by...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Persona3-16-068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Club Member: He's supposed to be pleased to meet YOU, Keisuke-senpai. You're the club leader, after all.<br/>
Keisuke: O-oh, that's right.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Persona3-16-072.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Keisuke: Things are going well...Fuuka-san decided to return to the club, and now we're getting a new member. Maybe I should stay club leader for a little longer...<br/>
Fuuka: Hey, Keisuke-senpai, you're a senior, right? You must have finals coming up soon, huh?<br/>
Keisuke: No, I...uh...h-hey Minato-kun, are you a good painter?</i><br/>
<br/>
Well, I do a little drawing in my spare time...just a bit.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Persona3-16-079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Keisuke: We don't have any proefssional artists in this club. I mean, I'm a novice and I'm the leader. Meeting you like this can't be just a coincidence...it must be fate. So if you're interested in joining the Art Club, just write your name on the sign-up sheet.</i><br/>
<br/>
This sounds like the place for me.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Persona3-16-085.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Persona3-16-086.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The creepy voices in my head agree, apparently!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Persona3-16-087.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Persona3-16-088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
My life's still a goddamn mess, but it's nice to meet kindred spirits where I can.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Persona3-16-093.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I was pretty surprised, too; what were the odds?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Persona3-16-096.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day after school I hung out with Kenji.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Persona3-16-097.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We ate at Wild-Duck burger; that place sucks, but Kenji seems to love it. I would've rather had ramen...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Persona3-16-099.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Kenji: But I kinda took her away from them, ya know, dude? Like I made her my girl before they even had a chance...Emiri is a really strict teacher, but at home she's a real sweetheart. She's always...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Persona3-16-103.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I quickly remembered why I didn't hang out with Kenji much anymore.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Persona3-16-104.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kenji: It's like a TV show, dude! Seriously! What about you, Minato? How are you and Yukari-san doing? Well, I wish you all the happiness in the world, dude.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Persona3-16-110.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Kenji: I'm trusting you, man.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Persona3-16-114.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Persona3-16-115.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I wonder which Arcana Chris Hansen would associate with...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Persona3-16-116.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Persona3-16-117.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Persona3-16-118.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Probably Temperance, since I guess fucking kids is a vice that people need to temper or something.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Persona3-16-122.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day, I overheard an interesting conversation.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Gossip: I guess they were all in pairs.<br/>
Listener: What, like they were attempting a double suicide?<br/>
Gossip: I don't know. But if I could pass out with someone I liked, I wouldn't mind being unconscious!<br/>
Listener: I would mind!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Persona3-16-128.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
After class that day, I tried to get Fuuka to walk home with me, but it didn't really work out.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Persona3-16-129.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: I'm not even sure if it's edible at this point...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Persona3-16-131.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Persona3-16-132.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Persona3-16-133.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I didn't feel ready to put my intestines on the line for her just yet, so I gave up.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Persona3-16-139.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Instead, I hung out with Yuko.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Persona3-16-140.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuko: Can you hang on a sec? I'll finish the story after I put my shoes on.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Persona3-16-142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yuko looked irritated at something in her shoe locker.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuko: How childish...</i><br/>
<br/>
I asked her what was up.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Persona3-16-146.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuko: It's the same stupid prank again...</i><br/>
<br/>
Someone had stuffed gum into her shoe locker! Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Persona3-16-150.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuko: It wouldn't be funny if I had gum all over my shoes. After the first few times this happened, I stopped counting...I was pissed off at first, but then I just got used to it. I'm tired of being angry, and I'm just too lazy to do anything about it. But if I catch her in the act, I'll grab her and slap her.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Persona3-16-159.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We left school together and went to hang out at the mall.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Persona3-16-163.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yuko's totally into MMA. I guess that's kinda unusual for a girl.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuko: Like I thought, brains are just as important as brawn.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Persona3-16-165.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Black-Socked Girl: Is that your new boyfriend?<br/>
Yuko: No, we're not dating. He's just a friend from the team.<br/>
Black-Socked Girl: ...You don't have to hide it. I'm surprised you can get such a handsome guy. Maybe I should become a team manager too.<br/>
Yuko: You've got the story all wrong, like usual.<br/>
White-Socked Girl: Maybe you should quit. You have to do so much running, after all...it's not very attractive for a girl to be too muscular, right<br/>
Black-Socked Girl: Oh, stop. Her boyfriend might hear you.<br/>
Yuko: If you wanna give it a try, I won't stop you...but I wouldn't bother if you're just looking for a boyfriend, because being a team manager isn't easy. You won't have time to be sticking gum on the shoe rack.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Persona3-16-177.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Persona3-16-178.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuko: What's wrong? Did I say something to offend you?<br/>
Black-Socked Girl: N-no.<br/>
White-Socked Girl: H-hey, we should get going now...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Persona3-16-183.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Persona3-16-184.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuko: Maybe I should tell you the whole story...that girl with the black socks, she went to the same middle school as me. Back then, there was this boy on the basketball team who asked me out, and we started dating. But he was seeing her at the same time!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Persona3-16-191.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuko: She blamed me because I was the manager of the basketball team. Does that make any sense at all? That gum on my shelf...it was probably her. She still holds a grudge. Girls can be so unforgiving sometimes...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Persona3-16-195.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yuko asked if I was mad, but to be honest I was kind of flattered.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Persona3-16-198.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuko: When it comes to relationships, you should never play with a woman's emotions. Trust me, I've been there before. ...You know, if people see us sitting together like this, they may think we really ARE dating...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Persona3-16-203.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I...is a girl actually showing interest in me?! Woohoo! My life is slightly less of a goddamn mess!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Persona3-16-206.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Persona3-16-207.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Well, that's what I thought before strange voices in my head spoke up...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Persona3-16-208.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Persona3-16-209.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Persona3-16-210.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and rewarded me with magic powers for successfully acting smooove. I wish I was normal. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-smith.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Persona3-16-214.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuko: You probably figured that out already, huh? S-see ya later...</i><br/>
<br/>
I headed back to the dorm after that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-Persona3-16-220.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day was a Sunday, so I had time to play Innocent Sin Online with Maya.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Persona3-16-222.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Persona3-16-223.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-Persona3-16-224.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
She warped us out of the Hospital with a spell.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Persona3-16-227.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Persona3-16-229.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: pshyeah right...it's just a game...we should go lvl or sumthing. i'm so lazy irl tatsu... i havnt even gotten dressed or put on makeup T_T</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Persona3-16-233.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Persona3-16-234.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I asked her who Mr. E was, along with admiring that awesome emoticon.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Persona3-16-236.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: i shouldn't have mentioned his name, huh? &gt;_&gt; hahahahaha roflmao!!1 dun get me busted, k? O=)</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Persona3-16-241.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: there were alot of dupers an goldfarmers, but still... =/ its good tho cuz it lets us talk about personal things rite? &gt;=P ...maya IS a shy girl, u know...:<img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-blush.gif"/>: lol</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Persona3-16-245.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: ...oh noes! u can't figure out what my job is can u? O_o</i><br/>
<br/>
Well, she was a teacher, duh.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Persona3-16-248.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: you get an A+ for reading comprehension today! lol d-^_^ now u know i'm a teacher</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-Persona3-16-252.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: when i complain to u, i feel better afterwards! xD from now on we HAVE to group together promise, k? &gt;=|</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Persona3-16-257.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Persona3-16-258.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
A teacher, huh?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-Persona3-16-259.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-Persona3-16-260.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-Persona3-16-261.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't have thought so based on how she acts online...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: i'm so pumped, i think i'll clean teh bathroom xD it's been 2 months o_O</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Persona3-16-264.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-Persona3-16-265.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-Persona3-16-266.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
She signed off again, and this time I did too.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-Persona3-16-268.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day, I ran into Yukari before class.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: Ya know, in about a week, there'll be another mission...I wonder what it'll be like this time? I guess we'll have to keep fighting until we defeat all 8 that are left. But...what are we gonna do after that? I've been thinking about this for a while. I wonder if Mitsuru-senpai is hiding something from us...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Persona3-16-276.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I got an unwelcome reminder in class that day - Finals are in two weeks. Ugh. Gotta start cramming sooner this time.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
After school that day I decided to go to Student Council.<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Persona3-16-282.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Hidetoshi: He just wants to help create a better school environment, so he offered to help us. Just like how the President asked Minato-kun to join Student Council.<br/>
Student Council Member: What?! You can't decide something like that without the President's permission!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Persona3-16-289.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chihiro: ...and that teacher wants us to look for the one who did it...</i><br/>
<br/>
How in the world are we supposed to find ONE smoking kid with only a cigarette butt as evidence? Is it really that big a deal?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Persona3-16-292.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Hidetoshi: Look, you ahve two choies. Either help out and prove you're trustworthy, or refuse and raise suspicion. We sure have to deal with a lot of BS around here, don't we Minato-kun?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-Persona3-16-297.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-Persona3-16-298.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Well, at least he trusts me...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-Persona3-16-299.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-Persona3-16-300.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-Persona3-16-301.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...though this whole thing seems really Spartan to me.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-Persona3-16-308.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I was pretty tired, so after Student Council I went home and took a nap. I had a dream, as usual...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: It's okay, what's on your mind?<br/>
Yukari: Well, um...I was hoping you could do me a favor with your skill.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="111-Persona3-16-312.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-Persona3-16-313.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: They were reported as absent, but I found some records that suggest it was something serious. Do you know anything about it, Fuuka?<br/>
Fuuka: Me? Um, not really...<br/>
Yukari: I know it was a long time ago, but...doesn't it seem suspicious to you? From what I've heard, this isn't the first time Shadows have appeared.<br/>
Fuuka: Wait, are you saying...?<br/>
Yukari: I don't know, but I wonder...and I'm not trying to make trouble, but...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="113-Persona3-16-322.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: Does she?<br/>
Yukari: I just wanna know what happened back then. If it doesn't have anything to do with the Shadows, then fine.<br/>
Fuuka: ...I understand. Okay, I'll see what I can do.</i><br/>
<br/>
My dream ended there.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="114-Persona3-16-328.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day after class, I went to hang out with Chihiro.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-Persona3-16-329.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chihiro: I may have caught a cold...I'm sorry, Minato-san, but can we go to a drug store?</i><br/>
<br/>
We did just that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-Persona3-16-334.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
After Chihiro got her medicine, she came back out...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="117-Persona3-16-335.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and nearly ran right into some asshole.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chihiro: Wh-what do you want?<br/>
Creep: You just came out of the drug store, right? What'd ya buy? Hm? Hmm?!<br/>
Chihiro: L-leave me alone! Go away! Minato-san...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="118-Persona3-16-341.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I'm normally not a very intimidating guy, but I guess fighting horrible monsters from another dimension on a biweekly basis helps with that kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-Persona3-16-342.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The creep ran off.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chihiro: I-I'm glad. I thought you were going to hit him, Minato-san...I-I wouldn't want you to fight because of me, but just now you were...um...you helped me, Minato-san, and I'm not scared anymore, b-but...why am I still shaking?</i><br/>
<br/>
I went over to her and took her hand, thinking it would help her calm down.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-Persona3-16-349.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chihiro: Thank you...I'm okay now.</i> <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Persona3-16-352.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chihiro: Minato-san, I...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-Persona3-16-356.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="123-Persona3-16-357.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Wait a second, is this ANOTHER girl showing interest in me?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="124-Persona3-16-358.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="125-Persona3-16-359.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="126-Persona3-16-360.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Maybe I'm changing...I guess my life's kinda forced that sort of thing on me, but who knows?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="127-Persona3-16-363.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="128-Persona3-16-364.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Chihiro ran off, and I headed back to the dorm. I'm up here blogging before bed, and now I'm gonna go ahead and wrap it up. I'll see you guys next time!<br/>
