<br/>
My summer vacation is slowly ebbing away like my precious life's blood! Woe, woe!<br/>
<br/>
Y'know, I can't even act emo anymore these days. All I can do is sit and watch astounded at how ridiculous my life really is. Tell you what, let's go over it together.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-Persona3-25-002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
For instance, my MMO partner Maya is actually my composition teacher at school who harbors a secret desire to fuck my brains out. Well, it's not secret enough that she won't tell people on the Internet about it, but...yeah.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Persona3-25-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, we have Kenji, who harbors a secret desire to fuck his teacher's brains out. I really think there's something in the water around here.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Persona3-25-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I've just been getting by, myself. Going to movies here and there, hanging out with friends, the usual.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Persona3-25-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The best part about that? "The usual" for me entails going out and fighting horrible monsters from another dimension twice a week or so. I guess it's better than gym class.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Persona3-25-021.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I usually accomplish this demonslaying by summoning women in various states of undress by plugging myself in the head. Metaphorically, of course. Evokers don't actually shoot anything, but it looks realistic enough.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Persona3-25-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
In a recent hilarious development, I gained the power to <i>raise the dead</i> by committing metaphorical suicide. Nietzsche would love this.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Persona3-25-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Other exciting Persona include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakshayani" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sati</a>, a goddess of longevity...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Persona3-25-027.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_%28mythology%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Titan</a>, the god of linebackers.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Persona3-25-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ose_%28demon%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ose</a>, another goddamned furry.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Persona3-25-034.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Persona3-25-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
There's a lot of deep symbolism behind our method of combat, though, don't get me wrong. "GIANT SNAKES THAT EAT PEOPLE", er, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orochi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Yamatano-orochi</a>, is clearly a manifestation of some frightening sliver of my soul, not, y'know, a bunch of giant snakes that eat people.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Persona3-25-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Not to mention that creating Personas is a very exact science, which amounts to "stick them together and hope they don't become a horrible blob monster."<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Persona3-25-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The fact that we do this all the goddamn time means that we're actually getting pretty good at it - I even managed to increase my Persona stock again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Persona3-25-028.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh, let's not forget that my dog has the same psychic powers I do and can use them to summon the unholy powers of darkness to defeat our enemies. That's important. Check it out:<br/>

<br/>
So I, along with my dog, a battle droid, and several other upstanding citizens, climb up a tower full of monsters which is actually just our high school.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Persona3-25-036.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Persona3-25-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We find valuable treasures, like plastic mirrors.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Persona3-25-044.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Persona3-25-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Well, I can't actually be bitter about finding awesome swords like this. My life was slightly less of a goddamned mess from the moment I found this thing. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-unsmith.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Persona3-25-031.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We also use complex battle tactics like "listen to the dog when we're fighting for our lives" to ensure our survival.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Persona3-25-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
You know what's funny, though? Things always seem to work out. It's like Lassie if Lassie could kill you with mind bullets.<br/>

<br/>
Anyway, enough description. After we took down the poorly-named magician Shadows, we headed home, and I went online the next day.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Persona3-25-059.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Persona3-25-060.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: ...i should apologize. about, uh...all that stuff I said o_O;; remember how i said i would send our chat log to the admins before? &gt;_&gt;</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Persona3-25-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Looks like you're safe from prosecution, then.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: i read over our chat log and i didn't like waht i saw =/ what kind fo person plays an MMO jus to bitch about coworkers? -_-</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Persona3-25-073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: u shouldn't have had to put up w/me doin that. im sry m(__)m sum teacher i am, rite? =/</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Persona3-25-075.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Persona3-25-076.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...I actually realized I'd miss having someone to MMO with. It might sound kind of pathetic, but she's still a person on the other end of the screen. I told her how I felt.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Persona3-25-078.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: since nobody can see my face on teh intarweb, i could be mean...=( so i jus have to look @ myself in the mirror and make it rite! ^_^</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Persona3-25-082.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: tatsuya taught me to be thoughtful even when im not around ppl =)</i><br/>
<br/>
Did I? I wasn't trying to. I was just being a friend.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Persona3-25-086.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Persona3-25-087.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I guess that IS what friends do, though...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Persona3-25-088.jpg"/><br/>

<br/>
(<i>Whenever you max out a Social Link, you unlock that Arcana's "ultimate" Persona. These tend to range in level from the low 50s to the high 70s, so we won't be seeing them in action for awhile, but it's good to know we'll eventually have the option. We'll look at these Personas in more detail when we can actually use them.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Persona3-25-093.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Persona3-25-094.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Persona3-25-095.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
(<i>Maxed Social Links are permanent; you can no longer hang out with that person, because you've achieved the closest possible relationship you can have with them. Warm fuzzies all around!</i>)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
(<i><a href="http://www.popanime.net/megami/wiki/index.php?title=Arahabaki" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Arahabaki</a> is an ancient Japanese god, and is also one of the more popular choices for a party member in Nocturne due to his being completely fucking broken there.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Persona3-25-097.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: i drew something in the sand for u, check the ground once i log off, k? ^^; its kinda embarassing but i worked real hard on it...if u upload a screenie to ur cellphone, u can keep it always!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Persona3-25-103.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: remember, lets think positive!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Persona3-25-104.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Persona3-25-105.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And with that, she logged off for good.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Persona3-25-108.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
There was a message in the sand where she had been standing.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Persona3-25-110.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Persona3-25-111.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Persona3-25-112.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
(<i>You get a souvenir item like this every time you max a Social Link; it is this item, not maxing the Link, that enables you to create the Link's "ultimate" Persona; this fact only matters if you're replaying the game, though.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Persona3-25-113.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I knew I'd see her again, but...well, that'd be different, y'know?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Persona3-25-114.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Summer vacation continued and the days seemed to blend together...I took a nap one day and had a vision of Junpei taking a walk at Port Island Station.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Persona3-25-115.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Shoot, it's already the 20th. Summer break's almost over...too bad there's nothin' to do. This place is so boring...</i><br/>
<br/>
He kept walking...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Persona3-25-119.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...but crossed into the path of a strangely familiar girl.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Persona3-25-120.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Uh...sorry.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Persona3-25-122.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
He couldn't help but stare, though. Junpei's tact is his best quality by far.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Persona3-25-123.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Dude, what's with that outfit...? And what the hell is she drawing...? Man, I'll never understand art. Oh well...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Persona3-25-126.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
After I woke up, I tried to find something to do myself. Innocent Sin Online had been discontinued...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Persona3-25-130.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...so I went to see the old folks instead.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Persona3-25-142.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I did the same the next day.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Persona3-25-143.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuko: I understand their reasoning...but if that tree is removed, I feel like the memory of my son will vanish with it...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Persona3-25-150.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Bunkichi: So we went to the school to say goodbye, but that just reminded Mitsuko of our son's death...</i><br/>
<br/>
I told them it'd be okay, though it was pretty hard given how shaken up they seemed to be.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Persona3-25-155.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Bunkichi: If you keep crying all the time, then what will your admirers think? Right, Minato-chan?</i><br/>
<br/>
They really did seem to appreciate my efforts to help them, so there was that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Persona3-25-161.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Persona3-25-162.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And also this.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Persona3-25-163.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Persona3-25-164.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Persona3-25-165.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
You don't need a reason to help people!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Persona3-25-168.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Persona3-25-169.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...Well, actually, this is sort of a good reason. Yum, bread.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Persona3-25-172.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That night, I hung out with Mutatsu...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Persona3-25-173.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and Maiko the next day. Like I said, the days just seem to melt together during summer vacation.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Persona3-25-174.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yesterday night I went to go see Mutatsu again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Persona3-25-175.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: Those folks downstairs, they're probably around your age, eh? It looks like they're havin' fun drinkin' and dancin', don't it? But if you look closely, their eyes say otherwise. I bet they come here to relieve stress, but I wonder if any one of 'em are actually enjoying themselves...stress won't go away unless you can take care of its source. You can forget about it, but it'll always come back.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Persona3-25-181.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: If those kids really wanna relax, we should switch the music to the Heart Sutra, and...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Persona3-25-183.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Persona3-25-189.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: I have a son...he's about the same age as those kids down there. He'll be 21 this year...if he's still alive, that is.</i><br/>
<br/>
He seems to be treating me like I'm his son...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Persona3-25-196.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-Persona3-25-197.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...which is honestly more sad than creepy.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Persona3-25-198.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Persona3-25-199.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-Persona3-25-200.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I can't help but wonder what exactly happened between those two.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Persona3-25-201.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: Well, it's not like I've got high hopes for the future anyways...all things are unique, yet not singular. Oh, sorry kid, I'm done talkin'. Go home before it gets late, alright? ...I'll see ya later.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Persona3-25-207.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I remembered that I'd found the striped shirt guy's pen, and I decided to return it to him today.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Persona3-25-208.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Striped Shirt: Ah...welcome home, dear friend. ...Thank you for finding it for me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Persona3-25-210.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: Have a seat if you'd like. I'll write something for the two of us.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Persona3-25-212.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: She was very...bright. Her face shone with the warm light of life.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Persona3-25-216.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Persona3-25-217.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: Misery is a harsh mistress. I feel as though I'm lying in an unyielding darkness. Can you understand how I feel?</i><br/>
<br/>
Well, yeah, I used to write poetry like that too.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Persona3-25-222.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: ...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-Persona3-25-224.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Persona3-25-225.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: Unless you're in my situation, you can't understand what it's like. But I prefer it that way. I wouldn't wish this on anyone. There isn't anything you can do to slow this down or make things better.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Persona3-25-229.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-Persona3-25-230.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: I haven't spoken to someone my own age in a long time. ...It's natural for those in darkness to yearn for the world of light.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-Persona3-25-233.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-Persona3-25-235.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Persona3-25-236.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I'm...not sure what to think about this. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-smith.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-Persona3-25-237.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-Persona3-25-238.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I'm fighting to save who I can, but I can't do anything for Akinari, and...it kinda hurts.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-Persona3-25-239.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: I would rather you not come here ever again. You only live once, right? Why waste your life among the dying?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Persona3-25-242.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ugh. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-smith.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-Persona3-25-244.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
So yeah. Meeting Akinari put me in a dreary mood, and I wasn't even up for laughing at Aigis' questions when I got back. Instead, I'm up here blogging, and it's helped a little bit. I guess my life might be a goddamn ridiculous mess, but at least I've got one. Poor guy.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm gonna go hang out with the others for awhile, but I'll write again soon. Later guys!<br/>
