<b>Entry One: April 6, 2009</b> (<i>Note: I'm posting the entry dates as they're given, despite this journal apparently having been written in the future. There are several other quirks like this in later entries, as well, though we'll look at those when we get to them.</i>)<br/>

<i>Note also that the events the second video depicts continue in the next day's entry - apparently he didn't finish working on it the previous evening. I need to finish straightening out the kinks in the archived documents, but I should have another, more traditional, entry ready to go later today.</i>
