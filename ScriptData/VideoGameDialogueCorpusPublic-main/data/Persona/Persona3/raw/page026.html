		<b>Entry Twenty-One: August 5, 2009</b><br/><br/>
<b>Mood:</b> <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-smith.gif"/> Beaten<br/>
<b>Music:</b> Eye of the Tiger. Ironically. Because I <i>lost</i>.<br/>
<br/>
Well, shit. I lost the regional competition, let down the school, and proved that my life is a goddamn mess for one reason and one reason only: me.<br/>
<br/>
...Well, maybe I need to cheer up or something. I guess blogging might take my mind off it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-Persona3-22-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I've been working on my karaoke in the evenings lately, trying to grow some balls...ugh, maybe that's not the right way of putting it, seeing as it reminds me of that tranny. I've been manning up a little bit in any case, which Junpei says I'm gonna need if I wanna try and get with Fuuka.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Persona3-22-005.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
During the day, I was working like a dog at track practice. Coach was determined that we beat that other school, so he pushed us as hard as he could.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Persona3-22-015.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Persona3-22-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Even Yuko was getting into it - that Mamoru guy must've humiliated Gekkoukan pretty badly in previous meets.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Persona3-22-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
On the night of the 29th, at the Dark Hour...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Persona3-22-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...Fuuka woke us up with a broadcast.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: I detect a Shadow! Please hurry to the 4th floor!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Persona3-22-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We did just that.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: There's a Shadow in the city. Yamagishi found it by chance.<br/>
Yukari: But...the moon isn't full yet...<br/>
Fuuka: Actually, it seems to be just a normal Shadow. However, it IS outside of Tartarus...<br/>
Mitsuru: It's near Naganaki Shrine. Akihiko went ahead since he was in the vicinity. I'm sure he can handle it alone, but let's get ready just in case.<br/>
Junpei: Gotcha!</i><br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, Akihiko called in.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Persona3-22-028.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Persona3-22-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: What's wrong? Is it a powerful one?!<br/>
Akihiko: No, the Shadow's been defeated.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Persona3-22-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: What happened?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Persona3-22-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
"The little fella"...?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Persona3-22-035.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Beats me.<br/>
Mitsuru: At any rate, let's go.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Persona3-22-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
When we got there, we were shocked to find Koromaru collapsed in a pool of his own blood.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Persona3-22-040.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: You know this dog?<br/>
Yukari: Yeah, everyone around here does...we have to help him!<br/>
Mitsuru: First we must stop the bleeding...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Persona3-22-045.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akihiko: He defeated that Shadow all by himself.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Persona3-22-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
First a robot, now a <i>dog</i>?!<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Persona3-22-048.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: These flowers...they must be for the priest who died in the accident.<br/>
Yukari: So he really was guarding this place...<br/>
Junpei: Uh, Aigis? Don't tell me you can translate dog language too...<br/>
Aigis: Canines do not have their own language. However, speech is not the only means of communication.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Persona3-22-053.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Aigis: Confirmed.<br/>
Junpei: He's not the only one...<br/>
Mitsuru: Alright, let's report to the Chairman, so we can conclude this mission.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Persona3-22-057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, Mitsuru used her connections with pretty much everyone to get Koromaru a vet.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Persona3-22-059.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I had trouble getting back to sleep, so I was beat the next day before training.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Persona3-22-060.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Persona3-22-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Still, I seemed to be improving.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Persona3-22-067.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I thought a little special training of my own would be a good idea, so that night, we were off to Tartarus.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Persona3-22-068.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Persona3-22-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yukari had apparently gotten tired of the Toy Bow I had given her, and replaced it with a shitty Short Bow. Sometimes I just can't understand people.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Persona3-22-072.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we got back to work climbing up the tower, dealing with Shadows along the way. One of them, a variation of the Relic, was fond of the Last Resort attack, which did a ton of damage but also killed the Shadow.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Persona3-22-073.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We met more new Shadows, of course. This Dogmatic Tower was a pain in the ass with its tendency to use Mazio, which would kick the crap out of Yukari and Aigis.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Persona3-22-075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
This Wild Drive didn't bother with elegant concepts like "Durr, hit their weaknesses!" and opted to just smash us to bits instead. Since both Akihiko and I could deal Lightning damage, it wasn't too hard to get rid of it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Persona3-22-081.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Finally, we ran into a new variation of the Dancer, which did the same garbage with Charm attacks that all the previous versions did.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Persona3-22-082.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Before long, we made it to the next Guardian, but we took some time to prepare first.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Persona3-22-085.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Persona3-22-086.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
For instance, I figured having <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse#Pale_Horse" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DEATH ITSELF</a> on my side would help out a little. <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Persona3-22-088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Likewise with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vetala" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Vetala</a>, which isn't Death or anything but I guess elephants are okay.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Persona3-22-090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Also, this Vetala had Maragi, which was one of Elizabeth's requests.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Persona3-22-094.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The Sugar Key she gave me would eventually allow me to create King Frost, which I wasn't powerful enough to control yet.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Persona3-22-095.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Finally, I made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamia_%28mythology%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lamia</a>, yet another half-naked woman.<br/>
<br/>
With death, elephant, and nude woman at the ready, we were ready to take on the Guardian:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5846438380043231854" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tartarus Boss 9 - Fanatic Tower</a> (<i>This is one of the easier Tartarus bosses. It does a ton of damage with Mind Charged Mazionga, but sadly that's pretty much all it can do. By this point, it's easy to get Personas that are immune to lightning attacks, and if an enemy can't kill Minato you'll eventually win through attrition, so this guy isn't a big deal.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Persona3-22-096.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Persona3-22-097.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We got cool stuff for killing the Guardian, as always, and proceeded up...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Persona3-22-098.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...with Pale Rider clearing a swath along the way...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Persona3-22-102.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...until we reached a dead end.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Persona3-22-104.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
As always, there was an Old Document waiting for us there.<br/>
<br/>
<i>The team leader asked me himself...I was so surprised! It's the same man who once saved my life.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Persona3-22-110.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We headed home after that, and I went to bed, but I wasn't asleep for more than a few minutes when Pharos showed up again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Persona3-22-111.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Pharos: So how are you getting along with the others? ...It is one week until the next full moon. Are you prepared...? To be hoenst, I'm not too worried about you. However, you should still remain cautious.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Persona3-22-119.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And with that, he vanished again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Persona3-22-121.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It was business as usual the next day with the Track Team...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Persona3-22-124.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...though I did seem to be improving.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Persona3-22-130.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I was also relieved to hear that Koromaru was stable - he'd taken some severe damage, but there wasn't anything wrong with his internal organs, so he was going to pull through.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Persona3-22-138.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Persona3-22-139.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Persona3-22-140.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Junpei also voiced a concern that had been on my mind.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Persona3-22-141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I hung out with Mutatsu that night, though it didn't really go anywhere...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Persona3-22-146.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and the next day at practice I found out that I had finally become the fastest kid on the team. It was really up to me to win the regional meet.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Persona3-22-147.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Everyone was abuzz about the regional meet back at the dorm.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Akihiko: Well, you better win. Watch out for Mamoru, though. He's a tough competitor.<br/>
Junpei: Hey, I've heard that name before...he's pretty famous, bro. I saw him in a sports magazine. Dude, guys like him are insane...you're gonna get your ass handed to you on a platter, so what's the point? Well, I guess the full moon is coming up soon, so you can call it training.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Persona3-22-155.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Junpei was depressing me and I felt like a change of venue, so I went to go have Mutatsu depress me instead.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Persona3-22-156.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: Hey, are you alright, kid? Y'know, money-wise? High school kids don't have much money, do they? At least, I never gave much to my son.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Persona3-22-163.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: Is there anything you want right now? Materialistic desire can lead to aspiration, but still...when you get to be my age...hmph, nevermind.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Persona3-22-170.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: So you never get to enjoy that better life you're working so hard to have. Quite a paradox, isn't it? Do you know what the average lifetime income of a white-collar worker is, including a retirement fund and an annual pension?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Persona3-22-175.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mutatsu: Thanks to me you learned somethin' new today, eh kid? Now don't waste your life workin' all the time tryin' to get rich; just take life as it comes.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Persona3-22-180.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Persona3-22-181.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Actually, I get all my money by selling treasure from the monster-infested tower of doom that my high school turns into for an hour every night.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Persona3-22-182.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Persona3-22-183.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Persona3-22-184.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I didn't think it was a good idea to tell Mutatsu this, though.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Persona3-22-185.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Persona3-22-186.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I was getting tired, so I headed home after that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Persona3-22-188.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Persona3-22-190.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day was the regional meet.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Persona3-22-191.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Athletes: We pledge to compete fairly and uphold the ideals of good sportsmanship!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Persona3-22-194.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And with that, the races began.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Persona3-22-197.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Kazushi: Hey, you're almost up, Minato! You ready to do this?!</i><br/>
<br/>
I told Yuko to root for me.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Persona3-22-201.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yuko: Oh yeah...here, take this, Minato-kun. It's my special drink. If you use it, you won't be tired anymore.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Persona3-22-205.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I'm not even going to ask what's in this.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Persona3-22-206.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Kazushi: Just give it everything you've got! It takes guts to win! Don't give in to fear! Alright, dude! Go for it!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Persona3-22-213.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I pushed it to the limit on the track, believe me.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Persona3-22-214.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Even Yuko was impressed.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kazushi: Whoa, dude! How many laps left?!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Persona3-22-219.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yuko had me thinking I had won the meet when I got back...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-Persona3-22-220.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...but nope. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-smith.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Kazushi: You did great, dude! Looks like all your hard work paid off.<br/>
Yuko: But...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Persona3-22-224.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ugh. I tried <b>so</b> hard, you have no idea.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Kazushi: They say Hayase just blows everyone else away. I thought people were just exaggerating, but man, he's insane! We could sure use someone like him on our team...agh! Next time, we won't lose!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Persona3-22-230.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-Persona3-22-231.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
He suddenly came up and started talking to me.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Persona3-22-232.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: I can tell you've been training. Hey, I was thinking...maybe we could hang out sometime.</i><br/>
<br/>
I said I was cool with that. No hard feelings, though I'm still pissed about losing. Blogging's helping out, though, I gotta admit.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Persona3-22-238.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: You still need to work on your technique, but if you keep at it, you could be really great. I think you might help push me to test my limits.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Persona3-22-241.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: Stop by sometime if you feel like it. My name's Mamoru...nice to meet you.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Persona3-22-245.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Hm, I've gotta keep that in mind.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Persona3-22-247.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Looking back, I did the best I could, so I don't really have much reason to feel bad. I'll beat him next time, though.<br/>
<br/>
I headed back to the dorm with my team after that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Persona3-22-256.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I guess Akihiko must've been at the tournament, because Mitsuru brought it up when I got back.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: It's quite impressive, considering you've also had the Shadows to contend with.<br/>
Yukari: That's great, Minato-kun! Not like SOMEONE I know, who doesn't participate in any activities...<br/>
Junpei: Blah blah blah, here we go again...anyway, we have more important things to worry about. It'll be a full moon soon, right?<br/>
Akihiko: Yeah, next Thursday, the 6th. Make sure you're ready.</i><br/>
<br/>
I got ready by hanging out with Mutatsu that night...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Persona3-22-271.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and playing online with Maya over the next couple days.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Persona3-22-272.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-Persona3-22-273.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: but when i was little, ppl said i was a real cutie -_-;; quess i missed my chance rite? nobody thinks i'm hawt ne more T_T do men only want younger women? be honest w/me =3</i><br/>
<br/>
I was kinda confused, and said so.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Persona3-22-278.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: when i get all worked up, i dun realize what comes outta my mouth =x</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Persona3-22-281.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: mkay, i'll be calm. i'll compose my bitching carefully for you. ;p one of my coworkers is really pissing me off. i'm trying to avoid her @_@ we use to teach teh same grade and we were together ALL THE TIME, its been a while but that kinda thing sticks w/u, u know?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-Persona3-22-286.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: some student asked her out, and a guy she doesn't liek proposed to her...ugh! and she acts like its nuthing! omg, rite?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-Persona3-22-289.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-Persona3-22-290.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
She...what?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Persona3-22-292.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: but thats rite, she's got fake tits</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-Persona3-22-294.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
(<i>Are you all thoroughly convinced this is the greatest game ever made yet? Seriously, I'm doing the best I can here. You just can't top this.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-Persona3-22-296.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: her pads fell down an it looked liek she had 4!!! O_O XDDDD theyre fake for sure &gt;=) ...an my school is FULL of teachers like taht! -_-;</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-Persona3-22-300.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Persona3-22-301.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I guess I'm helping people out where I can, so losing one track meet isn't that big a deal.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-Persona3-22-304.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-Persona3-22-305.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I guess I just needed to put it into perspective.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Persona3-22-306.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Persona3-22-307.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Persona3-22-308.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It's not really that bad.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-Persona3-22-310.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maya: but after what i said, i might go to hell ne way o_O;; well...i rented sum DVDs, sooo...later, tatsuya! thx for chattin</i><br/>
