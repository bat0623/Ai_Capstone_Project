Current Mood: <img alt="" border="0" src="1-emot-eek.gif"/> Anxious<br/>
Current Music: None, apparently <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-saddowns.gif"/> (watch the video in the last entry! I thought my mp3 player broke...but it's okay now, thankfully)<br/>
<br/>
Uh...hi, journal. My name is <br/>
<br/>
<a href="2-Persona3-1-008.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Persona3-1-008.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
<b>Minato</b>, and this is my very first entry...first real one, I guess. Stupid journal. I don't really know what to write about in these things...I'm only doing this because a friend from my old school asked me to. No idea why she didn't just have me get a Myspace, or why she insisted on making the account and picking the username for me, but she said I have to use this one so I guess I should get used to it. She'll probably read this eventually, so, uh...hi? <img alt="" border="0" src="3-confused.gif"/> Girls are weird.<br/>
<br/>
"Ramenboi?" And "1990" isn't even my birth year...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, today was my first day at my new school, Gekkoukan High. It was interesting, I guess. I met a few new people and all that. I'm more interested in what happened last night before I got to the dorm where I'm staying...but I don't know how to put it into words, really. I'm not much of a writer...I guess if you're interested you could just watch the animation I made about it. It's in the last entry. After you do that, you might wanna watch another animation I made about it...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I really think most of this was a dream...maybe I had too much soda before bed? I drew some pictures of what happened afterwards, too. (<i>Note: RB90 tends to transcribe his experiences verbatim in his Livejournal, which may seem unusual to some readers.

<br/>
This is Mitsuru, she pretty much runs things around the dorm where I'm staying. She's kind of a scary ice queen chick.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Brunette: Who's he?<br/>
Mitsuru: He's a transfer student. It was a last minute decision to assign him here. He'll eventually be moved to a room in the boys' dorm.<br/>
Brunette: ...Is it okay for him to be here?<br/>
Mitsuru: I guess we'll see...</i><br/>
<br/>
<a href="7-Persona3-1-016.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Persona3-1-016.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: She'll be a junior this spring, just like you.</i><br/>
<br/>
<a href="8-Persona3-1-019.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Persona3-1-019.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
This is Yukari. She really does have a gun, but you can't really see it here. I decided not to bring it up right away...I want to at least try to fit in here, y'know? Maybe there's some kind of toy gun fad here? Maybe she's just a freak. So I just said it was nice to meet her.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="9-Persona3-1-020.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Persona3-1-020.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: Nice to meet you, too...<br/>
Mitsuru: It's getting late, so you should get some rest. Your room is on the second floor, at the end of the hallway. Your things should already be there.<br/>
Yukari: Oh...I'll show you the way. Follow me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<a href="10-Persona3-1-026.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Persona3-1-026.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how much this has to do with the picture, but I'm really not all that thrilled about living in a girls' dorm. Not that I don't like girls, I guess I'm just not all that smooth. Also I apparently go by "Ramenboy1990". I'm sure that'll get me all the ladies. Hopefully the transfer to the boys' dorm will go through soon too, though I don't know if I'll get along with them any better <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-smith.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
I guess I need to think positive, huh...<br/>
<br/>
<a href="11-Persona3-1-027.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Persona3-1-027.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: Pretty easy to remember, huh? ...Since it's right at the end of the hall. Oh yeah, make sure you don't lose your key, or you'll never hear the end of it...</i><br/>
<br/>
<a href="12-Persona3-1-031.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Persona3-1-031.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
She asked if I had any questions, and the one that was eating at my mind was who exactly that kid with the contract was. Seemed like he'd been playing too much GTA or something. I read somewhere that that fucked kids up.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="13-Persona3-1-032.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Persona3-1-032.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
Aaaand she didn't have any idea what I was talking about. I knew sleeping on the bus before the subway ride to the dorm was a bad idea. Now she thinks I'm crazy. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-smith.gif"/> I'm already off to a great start...<br/>
<br/>
<a href="14-Persona3-1-035.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Persona3-1-035.jpg"/></a><br/>
<a href="15-Persona3-1-037.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Persona3-1-037.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
Well, no, everything turned green and bloody and coffin-y, but I can't tell her that when she already thinks I'm seeing creepy little kids in the dorm. So I played dumb.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: You know what I--...nevermind. It seems like you're alright. Well, I'd better get going...um...I'm sure you have other questions, but let's save them for later, okay? Good night.</i><br/>
<br/>
Well, yeah, like that question about the whole gun thing. But whatever. I hit the sack pretty soon after that. Figured I was seeing things because I was tired.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="16-Persona3-1-046.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Persona3-1-046.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
I woke up the next morning to Yukari pounding away on my door like crazy. I <i>have</i> a Bullet for my Valentine alarm clock, y'know...anyway, I let her in.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="17-Persona3-1-048.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Persona3-1-048.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: Mitsuru-senpai asked me to take you to school. It's getting late, so are you ready to go?</i><br/>
<br/>
I told her I was, and we were off. We had to take the monorail to school...it might be kinda stupid, but this was my first time riding a monorail, so I made an animation about it. It's right here:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8873908252117183663&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">First Day of Class</a> (I couldn't think of a cool name for it, sorry <img alt="" border="0" src="18-emot-geno.gif"/> )<br/>
<br/>
<a href="19-Persona3-1-049.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Persona3-1-049.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: You should go see your homeroom teacher first. The Faculty Office is right there to the left...and that concludes the tour. Do you have any questions before I go?</i><br/>
<br/>
I went ahead and asked her what class she was in...I figured it would be nice to have someone I at least kind of knew in my class.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: Me? I dunno...I haven't looked at the classroom assignments yet. Hey...about last night, don't tell anyone what you saw, okay? ...See ya later!</i><br/>
<br/>
<a href="20-Persona3-1-063.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Persona3-1-063.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
(It's kinda stupid to put a caption that there's many people in front of the board when I could've just drew it, huh? I'm tired, give me a break.)<br/>
<br/>
I talked to a few of the kids around the board before I took a look at it...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Male Student: There's no need for them to post the names of the kids who are gonna be in our class...I mean we'll never see them again after we graduate anyways.<br/>
Female Student: Oh, great...I have the worst teacher ever...</i><br/>
<br/>
...and it wasn't really all that exciting, so I went up to check which class I was in.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="21-Persona3-1-067.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Persona3-1-067.jpg"/></a><br/>
<a href="22-Persona3-1-070.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Persona3-1-070.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
Doesn't it figure mine's not on there? I checked again, just in case...<br/>
<br/>
<a href="23-Persona3-1-073.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Persona3-1-073.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
...and got lucky for the first time in my life. Thank god.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Minato Arisato - Class F</i><br/>
<br/>
So now anyone from school who reads my journal knows: I am in Class F. That is me with the black hair. Say hi...if you want. It'd be nice, I guess. After that, I looked around a bit and headed for the Faculty Office...<br/>
<br/>
<a href="24-Persona3-1-080.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Persona3-1-080.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
...as we see in this fascinating drawing. Art doesn't always have to be about exciting subjects, you know. And everything you draw is practice, so there's no reason not to do it. It's my journal, anyway, I can post what I want, so there. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-unsmith.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<a href="25-Persona3-1-083.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Persona3-1-083.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
This is my Composition teacher, Ms. Toriumi.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Ms. Toriumi: Minato Arisato...11th grade, correct? Wow, you've lived in a lot of different places...Let's see, in 1999...that was what, ten years ago? Your parents...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-smith.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
What a bitch. I really wish she hadn't brought that up. I don't even like to think about it.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Ms. Toriumi: I'm sorry...I've been so busy, I didn't have time to read this beforehand. I'm Ms. Toriumi. I teach Composition. Welcome to our school. Have you seen the classroom assignments? You're in 2-F; that's my class. But first, we need to go to the auditorium. The Welcoming Ceremony will be starting soon. Follow me.</i><br/>
<br/>
So I did, and we went to the auditorium, and the Principal gave a really, really boring speech about trying your best or something. Give me a break.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="26-Persona3-1-099.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Persona3-1-099.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
Some guy asked me a question during the assembly...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Some Guy: You came to school with Yukari this morning, right? I saw you two walking together. Hey, I have a question. Do you know if she has a boyfriend?</i><br/>
<br/>
How the fuck was I supposed to know? Geez, I just got here. I was nice when I told him I had no idea, at least, so score one for level thinking.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Some Guy: I see. I thought you might know, but...I guess not. ...So how well do you know her?</i><br/>
<br/>
<a href="27-Persona3-1-109.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Persona3-1-109.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
I was actually kinda thankful this teacher came along and bitched us out, since it made that guy stop interrogating me about a chick I just met. Anyway, school was school (boring as hell, in other words) but more stuff happened afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="28-Persona3-1-116.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Persona3-1-116.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
This guy just came right up and started acting like he was my best buddy in the world. What the hell?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="29-Persona3-1-117.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Persona3-1-117.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
I had no idea who he was and said so.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="30-Persona3-1-120.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Persona3-1-120.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
So yeah, this is Junpei. He seems pretty dopey, but I guess he's alright.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: I transferred here when I was in 8th grade. I know how tough it is bein' the new kid...So I wanted to say "hey." ...See what a nice guy I am?!</i><br/>
<br/>
Yukari's in our class, too, and she showed up right around then.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="31-Persona3-1-124.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Persona3-1-124.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucatan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Yuka-tan</a>?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: I didn't think we'd be in the same class again.<br/>
Yukari: <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-sigh.gif"/> At it again, huh? I swear, you'll talk to anyone if they'll listen. Did you ever think you might be bothering someone?<br/>
Junpei: What? But, I was just bein' friendly...<br/>
Yukari: If you say so. Anyway, looks like we're in the same homeroom. Funny, huh?<br/>
Junpei: Um, hello? Are you forgetting that I'm in this class too?</i><br/>
<br/>
<a href="32-Persona3-1-134.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Persona3-1-134.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
Ugh, christ, not this again. <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-sigh.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: What's up with that? C'mon, gimme the dirt!<br/>
Yukari: Wh-what are you talking about?! We live in the same dorm. There's nothing going on, okay?! Why are people even talking about it?! Now you have me worried...</i><br/>
<br/>
...Am I really <i>that</i> bad? <img alt="" border="0" src="../Smilies/emot-smith.gif"/><br/>
<br/>
<a href="33-Persona3-1-140.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Persona3-1-140.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
She asked me about last night again. I still have no idea why she's so worried about it, and it's really just making me more suspicious.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: Seriously, don't say anything about last night, alright?</i><br/>
<br/>
<a href="34-Persona3-1-146.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Persona3-1-146.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: W-wait a minute! Don't get the wrong idea! Listen! I just met him  yesterday, and there's absolutely nothing between us! Geez...I've gotta go. I've got something to take care of for the archery team. But you better not start any rumors!</i><br/>
<br/>
She took off, and left me feeling like shit. I don't see why it'd be such a big deal...then again, I DO have a pretty stupid Livejournal username. Maybe girls can smell that kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="35-Persona3-1-152.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Persona3-1-152.jpg"/></a><br/>
<br/>
I guess Junpei's not really that bad, though.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: She's so paranoid. But, hey! It's your first day here, and people are already talkin' about you! Believe it or not, she's actually pretty popular! You da man! Heheh, this is gonna be a fun year. I can feel it!</i><br/>
<br/>
I'm "da man"? Well, whatever. He took off too, and I headed home, where I'm working on this entry now. A little more happened, but I'm fried, so I'll wrap things up tomorrow. "Da man" is going to bed.<br/>
<br/>
<i><b>Coming up in the next entry: More of the same...or is it? We call that a "teaser".</b></i>
