This has to stop. We have to make it stop. I'm not sure how, but things just can't go on this way.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'll talk about the past couple days to try and chill out before I get to the important stuff.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Let's see...school's all abuzz about Career Week, which starts tomorrow. It's similar to work study or service learning in American schools, I guess. We help out at a real-world job instead of going to school for awhile. It's pretty damn dull.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
On Saturday afternoon, I spent some more time with Chihiro.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Persona3-40-007.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chihiro: Shall we get going? I don't see anything that interests me...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Persona3-40-010.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Persona3-40-011.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chihiro: I've been dying to read this! This is a collection of illustrations from the shojo manga I read! It even has short stories inside! I would never have expected this to be here...maybe the shop owner made a mistake.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Persona3-40-016.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chihiro: Each volume is 6,000 yen, so that means...18,000 yen total? My weekly allowance is 5,000 yen, and even if I used my lunch money...but I'll get them no matter what! By next month...wait, by the time I graduate!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Persona3-40-025.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Persona3-40-026.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I considered mentioning I was carrying over one and a half million yen due to plundering the deepest depths of our school, but I thought better of it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Persona3-40-028.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Persona3-40-029.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Chihiro was fretting about money...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Persona3-40-030.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Persona3-40-031.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Persona3-40-032.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...when another couple walked out of Wild-Duck Burger. Seemed like the guy was being henpecked.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Persona3-40-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chihiro: Until recently...but I sort of understand how he feels. That man...he doesn't have any self-confidence, so he tries to compensate with his money...but I can understand how he must feel, trying to hold onto something no matter what the cost.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Persona3-40-043.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Persona3-40-044.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I was pretty sure she was talking about me again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Persona3-40-045.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Persona3-40-046.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Persona3-40-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I'm still not sure if she's creepy or adorable, to be honest.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Persona3-40-049.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Persona3-40-050.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Persona3-40-051.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
She ran off after that, and I headed back to the dorm.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Persona3-40-064.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Persona3-40-065.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Speaking of things that could be creepy or adorable, I caught Aigis talking to the dog about how she apparently had a crush on Ryoji. Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Persona3-40-066.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I went to bed early that night, and had a vision of Chidori in the hospital. She was drawing as usual...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Persona3-40-068.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...until she heard the sound of breaking glass, and the hospital's alarm went off.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Persona3-40-070.jpg"/>|<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, a familiar voice rang out.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Persona3-40-071.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Persona3-40-072.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Takaya: Jin. The instruments, if you would.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Persona3-40-074.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Jin placed Chidori's weapon, a hatchet on a chain, and a new Evoker on her bed.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Persona3-40-075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Takaya: Surely you understand...there is nowhere for you to go. You must come with us. Death is not to be feared. You need only fear--<br/>
Chidori: Yes, I know.<br/>
Takaya: ...Excellent.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Persona3-40-082.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Persona3-40-083.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Persona3-40-084.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Jin: Hey, hurry up, Chidori!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Persona3-40-087.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Today was a Sunday, so I didn't have school, and with both Maya and Akinari gone I didn't have much else to do either.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Persona3-40-089.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I ended up going to see Tanaka.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Persona3-40-090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Tanaka: ...Oh dear me. I-I just can't concentrate. I get so worked up when I picture his face!</i><br/>
<br/>
I asked who he was talking about.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Persona3-40-093.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Tanaka: There was a young man who was working for me. He was a good kid who graduated from a well-known university, but this month he wasn't able to meet his sales quota, so I docked his pay. After that, his self-confidence went down the drain, then he just stopped coming to work.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Persona3-40-103.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Tanaka: It's his fault that the company is in the red this month! All that money I wasted on training him...it makes me sick just thinking about it. Well, he only worked with me for two years, so at least I won't have to provide a pension...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Persona3-40-109.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Tanaka: It's difficult growing up with no money, when you can't even afford shoes for PE class! Going barefoot in the gym during winter can be torture!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Persona3-40-113.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Tanaka: Your innocent appearance would be perfect for camouflaging the ugly realities of business! Think about it, will you? You won't ever have to worry about being able to buy shoes for PE.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Persona3-40-118.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Persona3-40-119.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...He wants me to be a male model?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Persona3-40-120.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Persona3-40-121.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Persona3-40-122.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I guess that'd be cool. I've heard of one named Rodrigo from Spain, apparently he's pretty popular over there.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Persona3-40-127.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Anyway, now we're up to the bad part. During the Dark Hour tonight...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Persona3-40-128.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Fuuka woke me up and told me to come to the command room.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Persona3-40-132.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
She had Juno out scanning when I got there.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Persona3-40-133.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: Other Persona-users. They're outside Tartarus!<br/>
Ken: Other Persona-users...? Don't tell me it's...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Persona3-40-136.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: First the Dark Hour won't go away, and now Strega is back?! What's happening?!<br/>
Akihiko: How many are there, Yamagishi?<br/>
Fuuka: There's only one, but...I thought she was in the hospital...no...she's...she's inside...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Persona3-40-143.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Persona3-40-144.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Persona3-40-145.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
All of a sudden, Fuuka's voice was replaced with Chidori's.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Persona3-40-146.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: She's speaking thruogh Yamagishi?!<br/>
Chidori: I can't stand the sight of you all anymore...so I've decided to do something about it. Come to me...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Persona3-40-151.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: Junpei, do you know what's going on?! Junpei!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Persona3-40-154.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Persona3-40-155.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Junpei ran off alone...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Persona3-40-157.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Persona3-40-158.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and we prepared to follow after him.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Persona3-40-159.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Persona3-40-160.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I decided to take Yukari, Akihiko, and Ken along for this mission.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Persona3-40-166.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Chidori was waiting for us at Tartarus, just as Fuuka had thought.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Persona3-40-168.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chidori: ...<br/>
Junpei: It doesn't make any sense! I mean, I know I'm not that smart, and I've done a lot of stupid stuff...but we shouldn't be fighting like this!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Persona3-40-173.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Junpei went up to Chidori to try to talk some sense into her...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Persona3-40-174.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and just barely avoided getting sliced in two by her hatchet.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Persona3-40-176.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Persona3-40-177.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Chidori...! Why?!<br/>
Akihiko: Get back, Junpei! It's useless trying to reason with her!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Persona3-40-182.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
With that, we grabbed our weapons and went into battle.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8795345211627548090" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boss - Chidori</a> (<i>This fight's kind of embarrassing, really. Chidori's pretty weak, and the only noteworthy facets of this battle are her unique skill Spring of Life and the fact that her Persona, Medea of the Hanged Man Arcana, looks awesome. Also note that RB90 appears to have used Vimeo for this animation; perhaps Google Video was being uncooperative at the time?</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Persona3-40-184.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
After the fight, Chidori was unable to threaten Junpei any longer, so he ran to her side again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Persona3-40-185.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Junpei: Chidori, please...tell me why you're doing this...<br/>
Chidori: What I fear most isn't death. What I fear most is...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Persona3-40-189.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Persona3-40-190.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Chidori: That's why we only live for the moment...but you...you brought me pain...pain that I didn't want...pain that I never asked for...<br/>
Junpei: Huh...?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Persona3-40-194.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-Persona3-40-195.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Persona3-40-196.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
All of a sudden...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Persona3-40-200.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...Fuuka sensed something else.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-Persona3-40-202.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It was exactly who we expected.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Persona3-40-204.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Persona3-40-205.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Takaya: Chidori...I see that it is too late. You've been poisoned by them...<br/>
Junpei: What the hell does that mean, you friggin' ghost?!<br/>
Takaya: I am no ghost...fate permitted me to live, even though I wasn't attached to life...you might say I was chosen.<br/>
Junpei: You bastard...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Persona3-40-212.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Persona3-40-213.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Junpei seemed resolute...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Persona3-40-215.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Persona3-40-216.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...but all Takaya did was laugh, raise his revolver, and then...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Persona3-40-220.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Persona3-40-221.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-Persona3-40-222.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...we lost another friend.<br/>
<br/>
