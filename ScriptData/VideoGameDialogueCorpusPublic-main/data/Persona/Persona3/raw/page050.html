		<b>Entry Forty-Five: December 10th, 2009</b><br/><br/>
<b>Mood:</b> ...Do you have to ask?<br/>
<b>Music:</b> ...<br/>
<br/>
So...it's been a week, and we're still going to die. What else can I say?<br/>
<br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Persona3-43-002.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It's hard to talk about the other guys here at the dorm, for instance. They're all as afraid as I am.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Persona3-43-003.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Persona3-43-004.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It's all we can think about.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Persona3-43-005.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Persona3-43-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We haven't even been to Tartarus in the past week because we can't get our minds off the Fall. Can you blame us?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Persona3-43-008.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Persona3-43-009.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Persona3-43-010.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh, it gets worse: apparently there's a rumor spreading that Apathy Syndrome isn't a big deal, so any help we might have gotten from the public is gone. Not like anyone would believe a bunch of high schoolers talking about the end of the world anyway, but it's still disheartening.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Persona3-43-014.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I've been trying to maintain some sense of normalcy, at least. I've still been hanging out with my friends, but it's just been reminding me how alone we are in this.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Persona3-43-018.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I couldn't tell Kenji that the embodiment of Death itself is coming to turn us all into drooling zombies, for instance.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Persona3-43-019.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Persona3-43-020.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
He's too busy being involved in an ethical scandal.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Persona3-43-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Kenji: It's like all of a sudden, she won't take my phone calls or reply to my text messages...she's probably only doing this to protect me, but still. I can't just sit here and do nothing...I gotta think of a plan...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Persona3-43-032.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Persona3-43-033.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Is it wrong that I envy Kenji?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Persona3-43-034.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Persona3-43-035.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Persona3-43-036.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Sure, he's got problems, but at least he'll live to tell about them...or he thinks he will, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Persona3-43-039.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Persona3-43-040.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Persona3-43-042.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
So hanging out with my friends sucks, being back at the dorm sucks...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Persona3-43-043.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and nobody wants to go to Tartarus to let out some of this pent up frustration, so I'm stuck doing nada. Instead, I talked to the others about what's been happening lately to try and get their minds off it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Persona3-43-045.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Persona3-43-046.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Persona3-43-047.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
For instance, Fuuka knew the reason why we'd all joined together to form SEES. It wasn't random after all; we'd all been pulled here by my fusion with Ryoji.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Persona3-43-048.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Persona3-43-049.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Persona3-43-050.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
As for what had happened to me, well, here it is again: I was there when Aigis battled Death...that is, Ryoji in his natural state. Aigis couldn't finish him off, so instead, she locked him up inside my mind. <br/>
<br/>
If I were to fall during battle, Ryoji would've been released prematurely, and we'd be fucked even more than we are now. Even now, if I were to fall, my death might damage the delicate balance that's keeping Nyx from showing up immediately, so we can't let that happen. I've gotta be careful if we head back to Tartarus.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Persona3-43-053.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Persona3-43-054.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
When I returned here, with no memories of what had happened, my/Ryoji's presence awoke the twelve Arcana once more, and that's how we ended up where we are now.<br/>
<br/>
It explains the headaches I had over hearing about my parents' deaths. Those are gone now, by the way. I'm not really surprised by that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Persona3-43-056.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Persona3-43-057.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Mitsuru had information on Aigis; she'd been seriously damaged when battling Ryoji. That guy must have been loaded for bear, but that's not surprising given what he is.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Persona3-43-059.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Persona3-43-060.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Persona3-43-061.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
She had considered Ryoji "dangerous" because some latent part of her memory was still there, and she recognized him as Death. We all thought it was some kind of silly robot crush or something. Go SEES, masters of observation.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Persona3-43-062.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Persona3-43-063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
As for Ryoji, he's the thirteenth and final Arcana: Death. If it wasn't for being sealed up inside me, we'd be dead already; instead, he took on some of my human qualities, and ended up giving us the choice we now have.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Persona3-43-068.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Persona3-43-069.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Speaking of that choice, Yukari was busy pondering it. She restated what we all already know: Nyx isn't so much an entity as a concept. You can't defeat Nyx, much like you can't defeat the color blue. It just doesn't work that way, according to Ryoji.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Persona3-43-070.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Persona3-43-071.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Instead, we've got two options. We can let Ryoji live, but if we do so we'll have to face Nyx, and then we run into the problem I just mentioned: we don't even know if it's physically possible for us to battle Nyx, much less win if we do.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Persona3-43-073.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Persona3-43-074.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Persona3-43-075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The alternative is to kill Ryoji. This is the option he wants us to take, and I think it's what Aigis wants us to do as well. Upon Ryoji's death, he'll merge with the other Arcana and vanish; however, Nyx's coming will be delayed. If we do this, however, we'll be forced to give up all memories of what's happened; we'd barely even know each other aside from being acquaintances, and we wouldn't remember Fuuka, Ken, Koro, or Aigis at all.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Persona3-43-079.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Persona3-43-080.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Akihiko was thinking about some more basic questions. Shadows, for instance. They're fragments of Nyx, and they exist to call her back to this world. When she comes back...well, we're fucked. Remember the dinosaurs? It'll be that all over again.<br/>
<br/>
This is why it wasn't as big a deal when we defeated the smaller normal Shadows; they're each such tiny fragments of Nyx that she doesn't notice.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Persona3-43-081.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Persona3-43-082.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Persona3-43-083.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
As for the Appriser, that's Ryoji. His very existence confirms that Nyx is coming; basically he's the harbinger of the Fall. Bad news for the human race...well, for every form of life. Death is the great equalizer: it doesn't discriminate.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Persona3-43-085.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Persona3-43-086.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Persona3-43-087.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And Nyx? Well, like I said, we're not sure what exactly Nyx is beyond a concept. She's the origin of Death, and when she shows up, it's over.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Persona3-43-088.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Persona3-43-089.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Persona3-43-090.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Ryoji's gone for good now, even at school. I doubt we'll be seeing him again until New Year's Eve.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Persona3-43-092.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I've been doing my best to keep things real, but it's not going too great. How could I tell Chihiro what's going to happen? She can barely handle everyday life.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Persona3-43-094.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
What about Tanaka? How would he react?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Persona3-43-095.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Tanaka: He said "Thank you." He told me he quit his part time job and was going to study to become a public prosecutor; he wants to punish businessmen like me for bending the rules. He said I was an example of a negative role model. As if!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Persona3-43-104.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Tanaka: Lord knows what they would do to me in prison! ...Would you still come visit me if I was in the slammer?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Persona3-43-109.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Persona3-43-110.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Somehow, I doubt he'll have to worry about that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Persona3-43-111.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Persona3-43-112.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Persona3-43-113.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
There's bigger problems on the horizon. Much bigger.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Persona3-43-117.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Persona3-43-118.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
So big that we're torn to pieces. It'd been three days and nobody had even come close to recovery yet.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Persona3-43-123.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Persona3-43-124.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Yukari noticed it, too.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Persona3-43-128.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Oh, get this: there's exams coming up on Monday. Fucking final exams when the world's about to be destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
My life is a goddamn mess.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Persona3-43-129.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I saw Tanaka again on the seventh.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Persona3-43-130.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Tanaka: But no matter how attractive she was, I was repulsed by her dedication to charity work. If I say no to donating, though, the tabloids will tear me to shreds...why should I have to give my hard-earned money to a bunch of freeloaders?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Persona3-43-136.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Tanaka: That's what I had always dreamt of, but to tell you the truth, now I have too much money. Profits are booming, but I'm so busy I don't have time to spend a dime. Maybe I should train someone to take my place.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Persona3-43-140.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Tanaka: I could create a carbon copy of me! It would probably cost me a fortune, but if it works then I could sit back and relax in my massage chair!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Persona3-43-143.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Tanaka: Just kidding. People would think I'm a weirdo if I adopted a boy as old as you.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Persona3-43-147.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-Persona3-43-148.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Y'know, it's funny. I don't think my biggest accomplishment in this whole ordeal has anything to do with battle or Shadows.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Persona3-43-149.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Persona3-43-150.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-Persona3-43-151.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It's making all of this appear normal to everyone else, even now. They don't know what's coming. They'll never know.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Persona3-43-163.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...what could I tell Maiko? She's a little girl, not even in middle school yet. How could her mind comprehend the idea that the entire world is just going to die one day?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Persona3-43-164.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Persona3-43-165.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Hell, she's too busy worrying about her parents' divorce. For her, it's already like the world is falling apart.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Persona3-43-167.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Persona3-43-168.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Persona3-43-169.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I did meet her parents the other day, though.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Persona3-43-171.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Woman: Calm down? Calm down?! What if something happens to her! <br/>
Man: Oh please! This is what happens when you force a child to study non-stop!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Persona3-43-176.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Man: She said she hung out with a high school kid instead of practicing piano.<br/>
Woman: This is the first I've heard of it! What the Hell did you do to my daughter?!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-Persona3-43-180.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
She was furious, but I just stood there and stared.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Persona3-43-181.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Man: Look, we're Maiko's parents, and basically we haven't seen her since this morning. We found a note in her room that said "I'm running away. -Maiko"</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Persona3-43-185.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I told them that we could find her, and suggested she might be at the takoyaki stand...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-Persona3-43-197.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-Persona3-43-198.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...which, as it turns out, is right where she was.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-Persona3-43-199.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Persona3-43-200.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maiko: Well, I...um...I...<br/>
Maiko's Mom: Are you oaky, darling?! Are you hurt? What happened...?<br/>
Maiko: Yeah, I'm okay...<br/>
Maiko's Mom: Oh, what a relief...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-Persona3-43-206.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-Persona3-43-207.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I guess to a child, an angry mother is about as scary as Nyx is to us...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-Persona3-43-208.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maiko: Y-you guys made me worry too! I was so scared...you said you were getting a divorce, and I didn't know what to do! I don't want you to get divorced because of me!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Persona3-43-212.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That feeling of powerlessness is all too familiar lately.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-Persona3-43-213.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maiko's Dad: We're really sorry, Maiko. Why don't we go home and talk about this?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-Persona3-43-215.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I'll continue to help where I can, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Persona3-43-216.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Persona3-43-217.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It's all I can do.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Persona3-43-220.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-Persona3-43-221.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I can't help but think of how futile everything is now, though...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-Persona3-43-222.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-Persona3-43-223.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-Persona3-43-224.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...even if I've still got that thin shred of hope telling me not to give up just yet.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-Persona3-43-231.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
School's doing a great job of killing that, though. Thanks, educational system, you're doing your job as always.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-Persona3-43-232.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Maiko seems to be getting better, at least. Her parents might actually be trying to work things out.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="111-Persona3-43-241.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this morning, Mitsuru and I decided to call a dorm meeting together to talk about recent events. It's better than going on like we have been.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-Persona3-43-243.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I also went to see Maiko again today.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="113-Persona3-43-244.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
She wanted to go to Wild-Duck Burger...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="114-Persona3-43-252.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...so that's exactly what we did.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-Persona3-43-253.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maiko: They talked to me about why they were getting divorced. I was sad, but I listened to what they said...they said when there's no love, it's hard to still be married. They said not to worry, because they would always love me.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-Persona3-43-262.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Maiko: Even if you don't have love, you still have to try!</i><br/>
<br/>
That hit home in a bit of a odd way...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="117-Persona3-43-265.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="118-Persona3-43-271.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-Persona3-43-272.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...y'know, writing about this has made me think.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-Persona3-43-276.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Persona3-43-277.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Is it really a foregone conclusion?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-Persona3-43-278.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="123-Persona3-43-279.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="124-Persona3-43-280.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Is there really no way to stop the Fall?<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="125-Persona3-43-284.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I don't know. Neither does anyone else, based on how the meeting tonight went.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="126-Persona3-43-285.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Fuuka: You just seem so calm...<br/>
Yukari: We have to make a decision...I mean, it's been such a drag around here lately, and no one will go to Tartarus...<br/>
Mitsuru: ...You're right. We humans are quite resilient. We can adapt to any situation, given enough time.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="127-Persona3-43-291.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
