<br/>
It's been a few weeks since Shinjiro died, and everyone's still bummed, myself included.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-Persona3-32-189.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Persona3-32-190.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The day after it happened sucked ass.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Persona3-32-191.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Not only did we have to go to school after Shinji died, we had to attend the school's pathetic excuse for a memorial service. It was almost insulting.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Principal: He had a lifetime of opportunity ahead of him...as educators, we are to blame for ignoring his silent calls for help. We lost him to violence before we had a chance to help him realize his true potential...forgive us. Forgive us for our negligence...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Persona3-32-199.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Persona3-32-201.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Senior: I don't even know who this Aragaki guy was...I heard he never came to school. ...Prolly just some punk. Anyway, I gotta get home...I have to study for my mock-exam. ...Hey, you guys know who Aragaki is? Wait, you're not seniors, so how would you know? Anyway, can you believe this? Scary, huh?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Persona3-32-211.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Senior: Huh? ...what're you doing?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Persona3-32-214.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ms. Toriumi: Iori, sit down! ...I'll never heard the end of this.<br/>
Junpei: Tch...<br/>
Yukari: Just ignore them, Junpei...hey, have you seen Akihiko-senpai today? He was absent this morning...I wonder if he'll show up at all. I hope he's okay...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Persona3-32-223.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Mitsuru came to class during lunch and told us about a meeting we'd have that night, though none of us was really surprised by it - something had to be done about Ken.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Persona3-32-232.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I blanked after school that day and had a vision as usual. Akihiko went to visit Shinjiro's memorial.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Akihiko: I had the usual for lunch...ramen tastes a lot better when you're cutting class. Make sure you invite me next time...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Persona3-32-236.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akihiko: Why are you always like that? You're so stubborn. Put yourself in my shoes for a change...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Persona3-32-240.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akihiko: I guess you're right...I was too obsessed with power...ever since I lost Miki, that's all I've cared about. I thought that if I was strong enough, I could protect anyone...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Persona3-32-245.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Persona3-32-247.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akihiko: But I was so focused on fighting that I didn't notice anything else! It didn't matter how tough I was! Look what happened!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Persona3-32-250.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akihiko: ...yeah, I know...crying won't change anything, will it? Alright, Shinji...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Persona3-32-255.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Persona3-32-256.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Akihiko stood up a new man...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Persona3-32-257.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and he was ready to finish what we'd started.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Persona3-32-258.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Persona3-32-260.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Persona3-32-262.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Even his Persona evolved, reflecting the newfound power in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Persona3-32-264.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Persona3-32-265.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
With that, Akihiko headed back to the dorm.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Persona3-32-267.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
As for me, I went to hang out with Mamoru that day.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Persona3-32-268.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: Yeah, just...need more training...let's go in, yeah? I'm thirsty!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Persona3-32-272.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Persona3-32-273.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: I used to come here a lot with my teammates, but...they wouldn't come now, even if I invited them. I don't really get along with people who don't take the club seriously. It jacks up practice, y'know? It's a lack of concentration. I used to love it there...I spent all my time practicing in Track Team...everyone else in Track Team and I always had so much fun.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Persona3-32-282.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: I'll just have to surpass them. Get even better than I am now...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Persona3-32-284.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Persona3-32-285.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
He's a lot more dedicated to Track Team than I am...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Persona3-32-286.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Persona3-32-287.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Persona3-32-288.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...I don't think I'll mention that to him, though.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Persona3-32-292.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That night, we had our meeting.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: We need to discuss how to deal with Amada...I've already consulted the Chairman. Aigis, bring Amada here.<br/>
Fuuka: It's my fault...when Shinjiro-senpai told me he'd be late, I thought it was strange, but I said nothing. If only I'd listened to my intuition...<br/>
Yukari: Don't be so hard on yourself, Fuuka.<br/>
Mitsuru: It's not your fault. If anyone should have realized it, it should have been me.<br/>
Junpei: I knew this wasn't a game, but I never thought it'd end up like this...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Persona3-32-305.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akihiko: Shinji's last words were, "This is how it should be." He was a hell of a guy...he even faced death head on. That's why, from this day forward, I'll face things head on too.<br/>
Junpei: That's cool, man...<br/>
Yukari: Senpai...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Persona3-32-312.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Aigis couldn't find Ken, which presented a problem.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: He's not?!<br/>
Aigis: There are indications that the window has been pried open.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Persona3-32-315.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Yukari: Wait, Fuuka! Do you know where he is?<br/>
Fuuka: Well, no, but we can't just let him go off his own, right?!<br/>
Yukari: So where do you plan on looking?<br/>
Fuuka: I don't know, but we have to find him! He must feel so alone...<br/>
Yukari: Fuuka...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Persona3-32-322.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Persona3-32-323.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akihiko: Let Ken do what he wants. Bringing him back won't change anything, and we can't keep treating him like a kid.<br/>
Mitsuru: Akihiko...<br/>
AKihiko: It's his choice. He's the only one who can decide how he's going to live his life. The same goes for all of us...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Persona3-33-003.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
After school the next day, I hung out with Mamoru...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Persona3-33-004.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Persona3-33-005.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Persona3-33-006.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and that evening, Elizabeth called to tell me that more of Tartarus had opened up. I didn't feel ready to go just yet, though...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Persona3-33-008.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I also had another vision that evening - this one was of Ken at the Port Island hideout.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Persona3-33-009.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Akihiko showed up before long.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Persona3-33-010.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Persona3-33-012.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ken: To this day, it's still on file as an unexplained accident. That's why I wanted to make it clear...I thought that's what she would have wanted. Maybe then she'd finally be at peace...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Persona3-33-016.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Persona3-33-017.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ken: And once again, I'll be left behind...<br/>
Akihiko: The dead are never coming back. You have to accept that. You're on your own now...<br/>
Ken: ...<br/>
Akihiko: I'm not here to drag you back. You can stay in this place until you die, if that's what you want.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Persona3-33-024.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Akihiko walked off, leaving Ken to his thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Persona3-33-025.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ken: I've known it all along; I've just been lying to myself. I was consumed by hatred...I couldn't face the thought of being alone...but that's exactly what happened...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Persona3-33-030.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ken: ...I've made up my mind.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Persona3-33-033.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Persona3-33-034.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ken reached a resolution, just as Akihiko had...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Persona3-33-035.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Persona3-33-037.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...and again, his Persona evolved to reflect that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Persona3-33-038.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Back at the dorm...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Persona3-33-039.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mitsuru: Yes, it has.<br/>
Junpei: So where's Akihiko-san?<br/>
Fuuka: He said to leave Ken-kun alone, but I don't know. Maybe we should look for him...I can't wait any longer! I'm going right now to--</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Persona3-33-049.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Ken: ...<br/>
Fuuka: Thank goodness...I was so worried...<br/>
Ken: You were?<br/>
Mitsuru: Amada...are you able to fight?<br/>
Ken: Yes. ...I won't run off again.<br/>
Junpei: You sure?<br/>
Ken: I'm positive.<br/>
Fuuka: It's alright...we can trust him...<br/>
Yukari: ...Geez, don't make us worry like that, okay?<br/>
Mitsuru: Alright, I'll talk to the Chairman. Get some rest.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Persona3-33-061.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Persona3-33-062.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Aigis mentioned that she had noticed Ken and Akihiko's Personas evolving, and that it may happen to the others as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Persona3-33-063.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That night, Pharos paid me a visit.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Persona3-33-064.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Pharos: Can you believe it's already autumn? It'll be winter before you know it. You seem tired. Did something happen?</i><br/>
<br/>
I told him what had happened to Shinjiro.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Persona3-33-070.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Pharos: Until recently, this was the same to me as the blowing of the wind. But now I see things differently...for the first time, I have a friend.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Persona3-33-074.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Persona3-33-075.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Pharos: It's drawing near. Don't you sense it...? We are kindred spirits, you and I, so why is it that only I can remember? This is a heartrending matter...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Persona3-33-079.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Pharos: Forgive me if I have said anything peculiar today. ...Perhaps it is the change of seasons. Of course, our friendship remains steadfast. Well, I shall bid you farewell for now. Goodnight...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Persona3-33-083.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Persona3-33-084.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
"The Fall"? I've never heard of it before.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Persona3-33-086.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Persona3-33-087.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Persona3-33-088.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I guess it must be what we're fighting to prevent by defeating the Shadows.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Persona3-33-092.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-Persona3-33-093.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day, I hung out with Mamoru again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Persona3-33-095.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Or I tried to, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Persona3-33-100.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I ended up waiting for a good fifteen minutes or so before he called my cell.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Persona3-33-101.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: I just feel bad, since I'm the one who asked you to hang out...but actually my mother passed out.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-Persona3-33-106.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: I guess she fainted from exhaustion, since she works from morning through the night...this is my fault! ...But it's true! Look at all the trouble I cause her...what?!</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Persona3-33-112.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: Dammit! Why can't I do anything?! ...Look, I'm sorry about today. I didn't mean to cause even more trouble. But at least you answered your phone...and talking kinda helped. A little.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Persona3-33-119.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-Persona3-33-120.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Ugh, his life's already hard enough...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Persona3-33-121.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Persona3-33-122.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-Persona3-33-123.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...he doesn't need anything else happening to him.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Persona3-33-125.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
That night, I had Fuuka tell me about Akihiko and Ken's new Personas. Polydeuces had evolved into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ceasar</a>, for instance, giving Akihiko access to more powerful lightning attacks, better healing, and mass support skills.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Persona3-33-126.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Nemesis had become <a href="http://www.themystica.com/mythical-folk/~articles/k/kalanemi.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kala-Nemi</a>, a goddess of time with more powerful healing, attack, and light skills.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Persona3-33-127.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day, I went to see Mamoru once again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Persona3-33-129.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We went to the shrine to talk.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Persona3-33-131.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: I just left from the hospital. I still have to pick my sister up from preschool, go shopping, cook dinner, do the laundry...I've got so much I have to do. This is the kind of stuff Mom had to do every single day.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-Persona3-33-141.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: Even with the scholarship, I don't think we can afford college. I mean, what about living expenses? My family can't even pay their own...just like Dad, now Mom can't earn any money either...I'm gonna have to support them. I don't have any choice but to give up on Track Team...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Persona3-33-148.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="91-Persona3-33-152.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I told him not to give up - there's always hope as long as you keep trying.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-Persona3-33-154.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: I'm going to take part in the meet! I devoted a lot of my life to Track Team. I'm going to take all that experience, apply what I learned, and achieve victory! I'm glad we could talk, I feel a lot better about things now. Thanks to you, I have a goal to aim for.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-Persona3-33-164.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-Persona3-33-165.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
So even if he competes and wins...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Persona3-33-166.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-Persona3-33-167.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="97-Persona3-33-168.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...he still won't be able to go to college? That's horrible.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-Persona3-33-174.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I felt like he needed some support, so we hung out again the next day.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="99-Persona3-33-175.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: Think I should bring some home? ...Wait, I don't have any more money. Oh, by the way, about my mom...she gets to come home from the hospital soon! Hopefully I can help her a bit more, since I finally got the hang of taking care of everyone.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="100-Persona3-33-183.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: One of 'em offered to pick up my sis from preschool. Everybody's been worried about me. I mean, I thought I was the only one who cared, and I ended up ignoring everyone else there. And after all that, it was probably my fault nobody seemed focused on winning.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-Persona3-33-191.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: This is just great. I mean, i already totally loved it. Oops, guess I kinda started rambling there...I gotta run. And don't forget...I can focus on training again cause you've got my back! So thanks, buddy.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Persona3-33-198.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Persona3-33-199.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It's good to hear that things are looking up for him...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Persona3-33-200.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-Persona3-33-201.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-Persona3-33-202.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...but I hope there's no sudden downturns or anything.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-Persona3-33-203.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I hung out with him again the next day.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-Persona3-33-205.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
After that was a Sunday, so I went to see Akinari.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="109-Persona3-33-208.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: He was born in the calm forest of green, but he turned out to be pink. He's so visible that he can't hunt for food easily, so he's always especially hungry. The other animals dislike him and consider his coloration disgusting, almost like he's cursed. So he started living alone, but then he made a friend.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="110-Persona3-33-213.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Akinari: So the bird would stand on the pink alligator's back and practice its flying. It's embarassing to talk about, but I'm writing it for myself, so that's what matters. Maybe I'll be able to show you the entire novel someday.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="111-Persona3-33-223.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>AKinari: I wanted to write an upbeat story of my own to cheer me up. Maybe if I can find some meaning to life, I can put that in my story. When I write...I can see you in my mind. It seems as if you're telling me not to die just yet...</i><br/>

<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="113-Persona3-33-229.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Well of course I don't want him to die just yet.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="114-Persona3-33-230.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="115-Persona3-33-231.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-Persona3-33-232.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
Preferably he'd never die at all...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="117-Persona3-33-233.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="118-Persona3-33-234.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...but it just doesn't look that way...ugh. Poor Akinari.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-Persona3-33-236.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day was a holiday...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-Persona3-33-237.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
so I went to go hang out with Mamoru again.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Persona3-33-238.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: I got first place, of course! This maens my sports career might be over for real. Makes me feel a little empty, you know?</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="122-Persona3-33-249.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: I'm going to earn enough money to support my family. i think that's my responsibility now...got one picked out and everything! My father had connections at a car factory, so I'll apply there. Thing is, it's pretty far away.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="123-Persona3-33-257.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: I always blamed school or my family for everything. I didn't want to face the fact that I was responsible. I really lucked out, y'know? If we hadn't met, I'd still be a jerk. I won't forget you.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="124-Persona3-33-262.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="125-Persona3-33-263.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
It struck me that I kept on losing friends left and right...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="126-Persona3-33-264.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="127-Persona3-33-265.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="128-Persona3-33-266.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...my life is a goddamn mess.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="129-Persona3-33-271.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
The next day, exams started.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="130-Persona3-33-273.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
They were a piece of cake...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="131-Persona3-33-274.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="132-Persona3-33-275.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...even though they took forever.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="133-Persona3-33-278.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
I saw Mamoru for the last time this afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="134-Persona3-33-282.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: My mother started crying, and she kinda blamed herself, but I want to support them. This is a new beginning in my life. It won't be easy to leave this ramen, though...best in town. Hey, I gotta go...</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="135-Persona3-33-289.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="136-Persona3-33-291.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
We went out to the station together so Mamoru could catch his train.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="137-Persona3-33-292.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="138-Persona3-33-293.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: Sometimes I get pretty pissed that he's not around anymore. My lfie wouldn't have had to be so complicated, y'know? I could've enjoyed Track Team more...could've been a normal kid. But blaming Dad like that, it's just another way to run away from my problems.</i><br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="139-Persona3-33-298.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="140-Persona3-33-299.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
<i>Mamoru: As long as you have the key, I'll be able to stand on my own two feet, so next time we meet I can still be proud of myself.</i> <br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="141-Persona3-33-302.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="142-Persona3-33-303.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="143-Persona3-33-304.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
And that was it.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="144-Persona3-33-307.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="145-Persona3-33-308.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
His life hadn't turned out the way he'd planned...<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="146-Persona3-33-309.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="147-Persona3-33-310.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
...but he's going to make the best of it. I respect that.<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="148-Persona3-33-313.jpg"/><br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="149-Persona3-33-317.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
(<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lucifer</a> is a powerful archangel who led a rebellion against God and fell from Heaven. Many Christians now equate him with Satan.</i>)<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="150-Persona3-33-320.jpg"/><br/>
<br/>
With that, Mamoru shook my hand one last time, and left. I went home too, and now here I am writing. Shinjiro, Mamoru...wonder what'll happen if everyone leaves. It's pretty depressing, actually...I think I'd rather go to bed than think about it anymore. Bye, guys.<br/>
