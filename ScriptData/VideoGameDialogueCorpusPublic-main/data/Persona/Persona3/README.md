# Persona 3

## Gender Coding
"Beautiful Lady" presents as and describes herself as a lady, and the characters react to her as a lady until they spot some facial hair on her chin, at which point they accuse her of being a man. Much of this dialogue doesn't appear in the data file (as it's captured in images in the source, rather than transcribed). I've coded Beautiful Lady in accordance with her self-identification (female). This is an example of the problematic trope that transwomen seek to 'trick' men. 

"Maya" is the online handle of "Ms. Toriumi". This is only revealed to the player/PC towards the end of the game. As a result, I've coded them as separate characters (their speech etc. is very different as well), but this could be revisited.
