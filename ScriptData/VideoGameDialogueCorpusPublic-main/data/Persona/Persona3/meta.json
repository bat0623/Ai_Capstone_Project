They replaced the building after that, but ... there's more to it, too. Around that time, a lot of students stopped coming to school. Maybe that's why they put up the new building ... to start with a clean slate ..."

				"Kirijo? The Student Council President? You know, the Kirijo Company built this school. I wonder how a company that big was contracted to build a school ...",

				"I'll be in touch once your fortune has been made.",
				"We ran into a bit of a snag again. Some of the other investors decided to drop out ... since there's fewer investors, each person's profits will be even bigger! Do you mind investing a bit more? Just 10,000 Yen more. That should be plenty!",

A power that takes many forms, yet is bound by none ... it may prove to be your salvation, depending on where you end up.",

				"I told you, remember? I'm always with you ... but we don't have much time to talk. Tonight there is more than one ordeal you must face. You should hurry ... she's waiting for you. You guys will need her. Okay, then. I hope we can speak again ...",
