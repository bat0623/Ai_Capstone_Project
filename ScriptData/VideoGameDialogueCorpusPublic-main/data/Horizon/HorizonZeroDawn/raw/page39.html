<p><b>COUNSELOR:</b> I'm sure you now understand the urgency of why we brought you here, Ms. Okilo.
</p><p><b><a href="/wiki/Ayomide_Okilo" title="Ayomide Okilo">CAPTAIN OKILO</a>:</b> Captain Okilo. Are you trying to thank me for not resisting?
</p><p><b>COUNSELOR:</b> I believe we couldn't negotiate a diplomatic solution.
</p><p><b>CAPTAIN OKILO:</b> When it came to my country's lithium, it was always a swarm that would be sent to negotiate. <a href="/wiki/Metallurgic_International" title="Metallurgic International">Metallurgic International</a>. <a href="/wiki/U.S._Robot_Command" title="U.S. Robot Command">U.S. Robot Command</a>... The markings changed, but the robots were the same.
</p><p><b>COUNSELOR:</b> You have had considerable experience in human-robot conflict.
</p><p><b>CAPTAIN OKILO:</b> Yes, and I've got the prosthetic limbs to show it. Yet I continued to face this horror, even though the challenge was great. Cyber-warfare. I thought <a href="/wiki/Zero_Dawn" class="mw-redirect" title="Zero Dawn">Zero Dawn</a> would be a... a "Manhattan Project", to generate the deactivation codes. With the resources I had, I estimated code-breaking to be a hopeless endeavor. I was almost looking forward to being proved wrong.
</p><p><b>COUNSELOR:</b> Unfortunately your estimation was correct.
</p><p><b>CAPTAIN OKILO:</b> As your <a href="/wiki/Aaron_Herres" title="Aaron Herres">General Herres</a> said. So then. You did not bring me here to commiserate. What is left?
