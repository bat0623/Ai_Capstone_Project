<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/Travis_Tate" title="Travis Tate"><b>TRAVIS TATE</b></a><b>:</b> Now those lame FBI blackhats at MOCKINGBIRD back in the dayâ€”I enjoyed schooling them. But maybe I went in too hard on this poor counselor. She was cute, and just going down a checklist, after all. Couldn't expect her to see how ridiculous <a href="/wiki/Zero_Dawn" class="mw-redirect" title="Zero Dawn">Zero D</a>'s ambitions are. God's own budget thrown at a kid playing with a hologram sculptor. Palms up, honey, I'm just calling it like it is. "Look, ma, I'm making nature!" Now if nature is so important, why not let nature take its course? Extinction - that's natural. Zero Dawn, no ma'am, that ain't. Heck, it's so unnatural it'd be called an A-bom-ination back home. And you know it, that's why you're hiding it.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Meanwhile, my little honey of a counselor, she's munching the inside of her cheek - bad habit - she's chewed one of her nails, too, just one. Not your day, was it, little sweet pea? Saw her quota slipping away. Said, "I assume you intend to decline the assignment, Mr. Tate." You kidding me? Eighteen months hard labor in exchange for thirty years lounging around <a href="/wiki/Elysium" title="Elysium">Elysium</a> watching porn? Sign me up.</dd></dl>
