<p><b><a href="/wiki/Christina_Hsu-Vhey" title="Christina Hsu-Vhey">CHRISTINA HSU-VHEY</a>:</b> <a href="/wiki/Zero_Dawn" class="mw-redirect" title="Zero Dawn">Zero Dawn</a>—it is art, in a way. An expression on the grandest scale. But there is so much unfairness. Why was I chosen? Was it decided by committee? By algorithm? My family will be saved because I happened to graduate in art history? Is this... right?
</p><p><b>MALE VOICE:</b> Dr. Hsu-Vhey? Christina Hsu-Vhey?
</p><p><b>CHRISTINA HSU-VHEY:</b> Yes?

</p><p><b>CHRISTINA HSU-VHEY:</b> I met a man, another historian. His fields are Bauhaus and the New Materialists, but he once attended one of my talks. Another unfair chance. Of all the many people in that auditorium, that we should both be here now. And yet, I feel more accepting of my fate. No, it is not fair, not at all, but for the sake of my family, for the sake of art—Art is alive, it must be able to speak from beyond history, and echo in the future. Not perish into oblivion. This opportunity, I must do this.
