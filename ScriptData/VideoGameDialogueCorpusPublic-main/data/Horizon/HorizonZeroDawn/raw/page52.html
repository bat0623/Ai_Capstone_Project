<p><b><a href="/wiki/Charles_Ronson" title="Charles Ronson">CHARLES RONSON</a></b>: Evacuation happened so fastâ€”no time to think things through. No time for goodbyes. There were lines in the medical ward... I told <a href="/wiki/Tom_Paech" title="Tom Paech">Tom Paech</a> I'd be with him when he went under. But there was one last shipment of Paradisaeidae zygotes I could get processed, if I rushed... I'm still... angry at him for forcing me to choose... Angry at myself for... Well, he died alone, and I didn't get the bloody birds of paradise saved, either. All the time left in the world now to think. <a href="/wiki/GAIA_Prime" title="GAIA Prime">GAIA Prime</a>'s locks are sealed. <a href="/wiki/Elysium" title="Elysium">Elysium</a> sealed up, safe and sound. A distance of miles, but it might as well be on the other side of the galaxy.

If I hadn't been an <a href="/wiki/Alpha" title="Alpha">Alpha</a>, if things had gone differently, I could've been there. Instead I'm spending the rest of my unnatural life in here, with people I don't even like... And without the one I would have gladly spent life with... given the chance. Two hours since I signed off on the final executables, and I'm already a bitter old man, bitching to his <a href="/wiki/Focus" title="Focus">Focus</a>. There's a thought for future generations.
