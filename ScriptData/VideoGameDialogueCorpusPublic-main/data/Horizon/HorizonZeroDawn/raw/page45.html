<dl><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Tom_Paech" title="Tom Paech">TOM PAECH</a>:</b> I hashed it out with them, what the point of <a href="/wiki/ARTEMIS" title="ARTEMIS">ARTEMIS</a> was - I made clear I wasn't on board for a global zoo. We haven't exactly proved ourselves to be great custodians in the past few thousand years, so the idea of a reconstituted biosphere... Well, it's horrifying, isn't it? A complete horror show, we have no right to take a best guess at this stuff. But the alternative...? Nothingness. For there to have been all this, and then... nothing. And with <a href="/wiki/Charles_Ronson" title="Charles Ronson">Charles Ronson</a> running the show - I respect him, he's got a passion to him, he's hot-blooded. So I said I'll do it. I'll put my all into this, literally, when the project is done I'll take the medical option, thank you. Counselor said I might change my mind, I told him that he didn't know me very well, then. For life's sake, I'll do the dirty work, but I want no part of this pathetic, attenuated future on offer. I'm an outdoors man. Never did like the feel of solid-state lighting on my skin, and... a wee bit of a claustrophobe, anyway.</dd></dl>
