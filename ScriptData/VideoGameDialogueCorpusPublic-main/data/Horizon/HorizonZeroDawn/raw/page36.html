<p><b>COUNSELOR:</b> ...to discuss?
</p><p><b><a href="/wiki/Travis_Tate" title="Travis Tate">TRAVIS TATE</a>:</b> Hoo! So mama, she was right!
</p><p><b>COUNSELOR:</b> Pardon?
</p><p><b>TRAVIS TATE:</b> My mother, she took her Bible real serious. Not just Texas Bubble serious. Pentecostal serious. Favorite chapter? Revelations. Now, I didn't always understand her - on account of all that speaking in tongues and such - but when she did use her words, it was always End Times-this and Lake of Fire-that, on account of sinful lifestyles. Speaking of which - mind if I smoke?
</p><p><b>COUNSELOR:</b> A... tobacco cigarette?
</p><p><b>TRAVIS TATE:</b> Sorry, darling, my tastes run classic. Compliments to your team, tracked me down. Been a price on my head 18 months now. <a href="/wiki/Sterling-Malkeet" title="Sterling-Malkeet">Sterling-Malkeet</a> was me, don't mind admitting. Been plenty of snakesters chasing the bounty, too, but I kept the zigging to their zag. How'd you finger me?
</p><p><b>COUNSELOR:</b> I believe <a href="/wiki/Elisabet_Sobeck" title="Elisabet Sobeck">Dr. Sobeck</a> listed you as an <a href="/wiki/Alpha" title="Alpha">Alpha</a> candidate. Priority snatch-and-grab.
</p><p><b>TRAVIS TATE:</b> Always suspected she had a little thing for me. Hey - don't supposed you got real coffee in this place? You know - blood coffee? Conflict cappuccinos?
</p><p><b>COUNSELOR:</b> Mr. Tate, I'm clearing you to proceed. Just... go.
