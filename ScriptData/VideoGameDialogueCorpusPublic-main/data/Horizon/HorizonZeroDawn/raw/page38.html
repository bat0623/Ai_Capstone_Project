<p><b>COUNSELOR:</b> [garbled] with <a href="/wiki/Susanne_Alpert" title="Susanne Alpert">Susanne Alpert</a>, environmental scientist. Doctor?
</p><p><b>SUSANNE ALPERT:</b> I'm sorry? I wasn't-
</p><p><b>COUNSELOR:</b> Just stating your name. What were you thinking about, Doctor?
</p><p><b>SUSANNE ALPERT:</b> Nothing the General said. Not really. I was on the Syzygy/East response team in 2051. Just after the second earthquake compromised the reactor. I still dream about it, after all these years. The Red Zone spreading on the imaging, slowly, so slowly, like a hand opening its fingers.
</p><p><b>COUNSELOR:</b> Your involvement in that event is why you were asked for by name.
</p><p><b>SUSANNE ALPERT:</b> Really? That's interesting. Because... nothing worked. Nothing could grow there again. It was a catastrophic failure. But the Red Zone is a blip compared to global-scale biomass reduction. The biosphere and hydrosphere will collapse, render the Earth uninhabitable, long before the <a href="/wiki/Faro_Plague" title="Faro Plague">robots</a> finish us. <a href="/wiki/Operation:_Enduring_Victory" title="Operation: Enduring Victory">Enduring Victory</a> can't buy time against that... So you'd better show me what <a href="/wiki/Project_Zero_Dawn" title="Project Zero Dawn">Zero Dawn</a> really is.
