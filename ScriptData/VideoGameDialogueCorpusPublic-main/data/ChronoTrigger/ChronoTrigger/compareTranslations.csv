A great disaster in Zeal somehow threw me into this era. To my surprise, Lavos exists here, and, I suspect, in other periods as well. Aeons ago, Lavos descended from the heavens. Burrowing deep into the the world's core, he began to consume our planet's energy, and grow stronger. Lavos disappeared briefly when he was summoned away by a mighty wizard who lived in Guardia, in the year 600. In 1999, Lavos claims this area, and reigns from high atop Death Peak. Lavos continues to replicate...... like a giant parasite, he is consuming our world. Forced to live here, I continued to conduct research on Lavos. But I am growing old. And it's impossible to keep sane in such trying times. So before I lose it completely, I shall safeguard my data, and my ultimate creation... How I long to return home... But I have grown frail... So you...YOU, who have opened the door! I leave things in your hands. Only by mastering time, itself, do you stand a chance against Lavos. The odds will be against you... But you are true heros. The world is in your hands. Open, now, the last door, and take what you find there. My last invention... My «Wings of Time» ...","「扉を開けた者達へ…… 私は、理の賢者、ガッシュ。 魔法王国ジールの、ガッシュ。 私はジールの大災害のおり この時代へ、とばされた……。 おどろいた事に ラヴォスが現われるのは 私の時代だけではなかった……。 はるか太古の時代に、空より落下し ジールに出現し、地中深くひそみ この地球のエネルギーを吸いながら 成長を続けた……。 時は、ガルディア王国暦600年 魔王が呼び出し、一時その姿を現わす。 王国暦1999年 ついに地表をもそのテリトリーにする。 そして、まるで卵を生むかのように 私が死の山と名付けた場所から 自らの分身を次々とたんじょう させるのだ。 ラヴォスとは、星自体に巣くう 巨大な寄生虫なのだ。 私は、ここでラヴォスの監視と研究 を続けて来た。 だが、すでに限界じゃ。 こんな時代に正常な精神をたもつのは 不可能なのかもしれぬ……。 私の精神が死をむかえる前に この記録を残しておく事にする。 私の生がい最後の発明と共に……。 私は自分の時代になんとか帰ろうと 研究を続けた。 しかし、この研究が完成するころには 私自身、じゅ命を感じていた。 だから、たくすのだ。 ここを開く者に。 時間を行き来出来れば…… 時代を超えて人間が、この星そのものの ために一つになれば…… あのラヴォスをどうにか出来るかも 知れぬ……。 可能性はゼロに等しい……。 しかしゼロでない限り、かけてみる。 この扉を開く者に、この地球のすべて をかけて……。 さあ、開けるがいい、最後の扉を。 そして手に入れるのだ。 私の最後の発明…… 時をわたる翼を……。","To those who opened the door...... I am the Philosopher of Reason, Gasch. Gasch, of the Magic Kingdom Zeal. I was flung to this age at the time of Zeal's great disaster...... To my surprise, Lavos's appearance was not just in my era...... It fell from the sky in a distant ancient era, appeared in Zeal, lay dormant deep underground, and continued to grow while sucking up this earth's energy...... The time is Kingdom Year 600. Magus summons it, and it briefly appears. Kingdom Year 1999 It at last makes the surface its territory too. And then, just as if laying eggs, it gives birth to its own offshoots, one after another, from the place I named Death Mountain. Lavos is an enormous parasite that nests in the planet itself. I have continued the observation and study of Lavos here. But I'm already at my limits. Maintaining a normal mind in an era like this may be impossible...... I have decided to leave behind this record before my spirit accepts death. Together with the final invention of my life...... I continued researching so as to somehow return to my own era. However, by the time that research was complete, I was feeling my own lifespan. That is why I entrust it. To those who open this place. If you can come and go through time...... If, crossing time, humans can become one for the sake of this planet itself...... Perhaps they can do something about that Lavos...... The probability is equivalent to zero...... However, as long as it's not zero, I'll try taking the chance. I'll wager everything of this earth on those who open this door...... Now, the last door, open it. And then, take it. My last invention...... The Wings that Cross Time......","offshoots = 'bunshin',  one of those words that doesn't translate well. Sort of, but not exactly,  'clone'. While in the NA version  Belthasar simply states that he longs for Zeal in his pre-Epoch speech, in  the Japanese version he directly states that he was building the Epoch  precisely to take him home.

In order to open the locked doors, it is necessary to electrically charge the energy pods installed next to them. If you take on energy at the energy pod to the left and enter the pods next to the doors, they will be electrically charged and the doors will open. The guard machine that protects the doll reliably obstructs the path of those who stand before it. However, when you line up two guard machines, they cease to function, so be careful. Also, you are to place broken-down guard machines in the above room. The conveyor belt that runs to the right will reverse direction by means of the switch at the upper end.
