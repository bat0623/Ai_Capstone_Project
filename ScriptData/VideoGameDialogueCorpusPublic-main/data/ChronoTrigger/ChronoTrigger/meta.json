				"You pick up strange ideas venturing outside!",
				"Princess Nadia!",
				"Princess Nadia...",
				"Oh! Nadia...",
				"W, what do you want! I'm not giving in to your demands!",
				"It's your fault for leaving the castle! And letting these...hoodlums in here. You might as well beg for bread on the street corner!",
				"They're a disgrace to this family!",
				"What...?",
				"Get... OUT OF HERE this instant!!! I never want to see your face again!",
				"We're no longer family! Do as you wish!!",
				"W, what's that?",
				"...... For me?",
				"Let's see...",
				"What...!!",
				"How dare you...?! Giving me something this rich when you KNOW I have high cholesterol...!",
				"This is the last straw! Now I know how you REALLY feel!",

				"Liar!! I've never even seen you before!",
				"Nadia!",
				"No, don't say it. I was wrong to be so stubborn.",
				"I too, have that problem. I thought you left me, but realized that it was I, who abandoned you.",
				"Your mother... How sad! It has taken me so long to understand what Aliza meant with her last words. «Someday when Nadia grows up, she will bring her beloved to meet you. Welcome him warmly. It will be a day you remember forever.»",
				"Of course! You were so young! You ran around saying «Daddy, it's fun having all my favorite people here!» Seeing you so happy, she felt reassured, and she left us quite peacefully.",
				"Yes, why?",
				"You did.",
				"I'll let you exit the castle, BUT! ...you be careful, now. Take care of her!",
				"Sorry, fellas. I'm terribly embarrassed... Take care of Princess Nadia, OK? The real Chancellor's okay. He took off to the Knight's room sayin' he was gettin' ready for the parade!",
				"We've been looking for you, Crono. Where did you take my daughter?",
				"She says Crono has been a perfect gentleman, but...",
				"What do you think, Chancellor?",
				"Pierre, what do you think?",
				"...save the future, right?",
				"Here I was fussing about my kingdom, and my daughter, and you were saving past, present and future!",
				"Now, for a true victory parade! Tonight we celebrate...you!",

And she seems to have lost her coral pin, which is something she guarded with her life... Forgive me! You must be tired. We can talk about this later. Please rest in the Knights quarters, downstairs, to the left.",
				"Thank you, Crono. But...who was that girl we found in the canyon?",
				"Thank goodness, you're safe!! You may resemble Leene, but you sure don't act like her! Anyway, you've really helped me. Let me know how I can repay you.",
				"Oh, Crono... I've let down my kingdom. Since we cannot locate Cyrus, our sole hope rests on the boy who has the hero medal... He searches the southern continent, for the sword that can defeat Magus.",
				"Hello! You're always welcome here. What can I do for you?",
				"I get it. You want me to keep that huge shell safe here until the next century, right?",

				"Come Prophet, feel the power of Lavos!",
				"Foolish one! Your measly power can't touch Lavos!",
				"This is from me to you! You shall enjoy eternal life... ...as part of Lavos! Uwa, ha, ha, ha...!",
				"So! You are Crono. Why don't you do as Schala says, and run away, yelping in terror? Isn't your life precious to you? Mwa, ha, ha!",
				"Haven't given up yet? What do you hope to do? You challenge Lavos with that battered body of yours?",
				"Mwa, ha, ha... See the power of Lavos and feel his wrath!",
				"Behold, my pretties! Destiny, in its most brutal form. All the dreams that might have been. All the happiness, and sorrow, you might have experienced. Gone forever!!! For you there will be no tomorrow!",
				"The Dark Omen transcends time and space, waiting for Lavos to awaken! Destiny has led you here. And here you shall rest forever, unless you can defeat me, and smash the Omen!",
				"Come, dear friends. Perhaps I can persuade Lavos to share his dreams with you! Did I say dreams? I meant his eternal nightmare!",
				"Argh! My powers don't seem to work here! Wait! I'll simply toss you into the Mammon Machine! You'll be one with the Omen, Lavos...and me!",
				"So Melchior? You see, the Mammon Machine functions perfectly. Your worries were for naught.",
