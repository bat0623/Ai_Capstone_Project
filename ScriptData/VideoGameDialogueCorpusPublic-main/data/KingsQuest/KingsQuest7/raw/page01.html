0 0 13 1 2 "That floor is tricky! I guess things aren't always what they seem..."   
0 0 32 1 2 "That was awful! I should have DONE something!"   
0 0 33 1 2 "I KNOW there's a way to get that gem loose. I just have to think of it."   
0 0 80 1 2 "I just sat there and let those--THINGS come in and get me! I'll never do that again. I'll find someway to stop them!"   
0 0 75 1 2 "Hmm. That device must take a LONG time to charge up."   
0 0 74 1 2 "The troll king TOLD me the device has to charge up. I can't believe I forgot!"

0 0 71 1 2 "(SIGH)I fought the lava and the lava won. I just should have moved faster."   
0 0 36 1 2 "Oh, that was brilliant, Rosella! Next time, we HIDE from the nasty faerie!"   
0 0 37 1 2 "That darned little dog! His nose is just too sharp!"   
0 0 38 1 2 "Well, that'll teach me to be a slowpoke."   
0 0 11 1 2 "You know, using that shield was a darned good idea. If only I'd attached it to the cart somehow!"

0 0 69 1 2 "Hmmph. Next time, I'm staying close to the wall!"

0 0 12 1 2 "(SIGHS)Father always told me to let sleeping dragons lie--or at least stay out of the way of their tails!"   
0 0 10 1 2 "Very good, Rosella. Now you know that carts with three wheels don't go in a straight line. Sheesh."   
0 0 68 1 2 "Drat it. I just should have been more decisive."   
0 0 9 1 2 "That troll won't be reasoned with. I think something else is in order!"   
0 0 41 1 2 "I should have gotten out of there while I still could."   
0 0 39 1 2 "That's one tough guy! I need something that could knock him for a loop!"   
0 0 40 1 2 "I still think that was a pretty good idea...if only the pellet had some more force behind it. Hmmm..."   
0 0 8 1 2 "I guess I got a little too close to the edge."   
0 0 67 1 2 "...Oops..."   
0 0 57 1 1 "Oh boy. I should be more careful around big spiders."   
0 0 60 1 1 "Now THERE'S an unpleasant fellow. I'm staying out of his way from now on."   
0 0 60 2 1 "I always told my children there was no such thing as the boogeyman. I'd better stay out that awful creature's way."   
0 0 66 1 1 "Well, I NEVER! Some people are so RUDE!"   
0 0 48 1 1 "I knew I shouldn't have trusted that fellow."   
0 0 51 1 1 "Yikes! I can't believe I got attacked by a pile of cranky sticks!"   
0 0 4 1 1 "Oh dear. I suppose you can't just take things out of an offering bowl."   
0 0 5 1 1 "Drinking that water didn't help me for long, did it. This desert is treacherous!"   
0 0 1 1 1 "Hmph. Wandering through the desert got me nowhere fast."   
0 0 58 1 1 "Hmm. It would seem that keeping a lit firecracker in one's pocket isn't the best course of action..."   
0 0 78 1 1 I hate to admit it, but I think the direct approach isn't the best one around here."   
0 0 55 1 1 "Those dreadful little urchins! I'd best stay out of their way until they learn some manners!"   
0 0 56 1 1 "I'm just not good at this sneaking around business. I suppose I should have taken less time in there."   
0 0 14 1 1 "Oh, blast. I suppose I should have done something to take that beast's attention away from me."   
0 0 54 1 1 "Oh dear. I think I should have paid attention to that epitaph."   
0 0 59 1 1 "Now I know how it feels to be a <a href="/wiki/Rabbit" title="Rabbit">rabbit</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Carriage" title="Carriage">carriage</a> lights! I should have done something decisive."   
0 0 76 1 1 "I knew there was a reason I always hated those things as a child."   
0 0 49 1 1 "SHE'S not very hospitable, is she."   
0 0 50 1 1 "I'm starting to think the front door just isn't the best way to get into that house."   
0 0 61 1 1 "I hate to hide like a mouse...but I guess sometimes that's the only thing you can do."   
0 0 62 1 1 "That horrid little creature! I wish I could think of a way to distract him!"   
0 0 63 1 1 "What a hideous beast! I could use some advice on how to avoid that thing."   
0 0 64 1 1 "The Fates were serious when they told me I would need that strange device. I should have listened to them."   
0 0 65 1 1 "I know the Dream Weaver told me something important about those horrible creatures. What did he say...?"   
0 0 53 1 1 "I have NO idea why I did that. (SIGH)"   
0 0 18 1 1 "What could I have been thinking? I'm not a fish!"   
0 0 6 1 1 "Well, Valanice, drinking a pot full of salt water wasn't the smartest thing you've ever done."   
0 0 2 1 1 "I've got to find a way to get rid of that horrible thing--or at least distract it for a while."   
0 0 3 1 1 "I guess I just took too long in there."   
0 0 46 1 1 "Hmm. Maybe I should just stay away from that wretched thing for a while."   
0 0 45 1 1 "I'm getting awfully sick of that creature. I'd like to scare him off for good!"   
0 0 20 1 1 "That was the loudest bird I've ever met! I have to find a way to get it to trust me."   
0 0 17 1 1 "OOH! That venomous little BEAST! I'd like to get HIM out of the picture!"   
0 0 19 1 1 "Well, that'll teach me to go slogging through the mud. I'll never do THAT again."   
0 0 47 1 1 "I'm never going to get past that thing if I don't get some help."   
0 0 81 1 1 "I THOUGHT that looked like a spider web."   
0 0 15 1 1 "What an unfriendly creature! I'll never be able to get past him...unless I do something drastic."   
0 0 16 1 1 "Well. I think I'd best avoid that part of the forest from now on."   
0 0 52 1 1 "My goodness! Could she ever use a facial!"

1 8 24 1 1 "What can you tell me about this rock spirit? What manner of being is he?"   
1 8 24 2 25 "He is an elemental, my lady, older and more powerful than anything else in the wood. He has been slumbering for the past millenium, and no one has tried to wake him."

1 8 18 2 2 "(SURPRISED THAT A DEER SPOKE TO HER)I--I thank you, kind sir, but I must travel through your wood. I must reach the town of Falderal."   
1 8 18 3 25 "Ah. It is a silly place...but for the first time in my life, I envy their lightheartedness. Go carefully. Go in peace."   
1 8 17 1 25 "Hello, maiden. You look familiar to me."   
1 8 17 2 2 "I...I am sure we have never met, sir. I am Rosella of Daventry."   
1 8 17 3 25 "I am Attis, lord protector of this forest. I have seen your mother, Lady Rosella. She seeks you tirelessly."   
1 8 17 4 2 "My...my...my MOTHER? How--Where--is my mother still here? Is she well?"   
1 8 17 5 25 "She was quite well the last time I saw her. She was headed for the land of Ooga Booga, in search of you."   
1 8 17 6 2 "(GUILTY)Oh, poor mama!"   
1 8 21 1 2 "I feel your troubles are great, my friend. I wish I could help, but there is an urgent matter which demands my attention."   
1 8 21 2 25 "(GENTLY)Do not worry over me, child. Whatever happens to me and mine is the will of the forest. I trust her wisdom. Farewell."

1 8 19 1 2 "(CONCERNED)Who could have cursed these lovely woods?"   
1 8 19 2 25 "(SAD, LIKE HE DOESN'T CARE)I do not know."   
1 8 19 3 44 "(AS A SCARAB)It was Malicia. It had to be."   
1 8 19 4 25 "(ALARMED, ALERT, THEN DEJECTED)WHAT? Who spoke? I thought I heard a name, a terrible name...oh, my lady. I fear I am losing my mind."   
1 8 20 1 2 "Friend stag, you have heard the name Malicia before?"   
1 8 20 2 25 "Heard it? It was once the most reviled name in the Realm of Eldritch. She was the sister of Titania, but she was cast out of Etheria for treachery. It is dire news indeed if she has returned."   
1 8 20 3 2 "(FULL OF BRAVADO)I'm not afraid of her!"   
1 8 20 4 25 "(VERY GRAVE)You should be. Her power is almost unlimited. If you deal with her, little one, you take your life into your hands."

0 0 3 2 40 "(NERVOUSLY)Hello, Miss Rosella. What can I do for you?"  
0 0 3 3 2 "Nothing, doctor. I just thought I'd visit you."  
0 0 3 4 40 "(TOUCHED)Well, how sweet of you. Would you mind if we talked while I fill out some papers? I have quite a bit of work to do."  
0 0 4 1 40 "Welcome, Miss Rosella. Please, make yourself at home."  
0 0 1 1 40 "(FRIENDLY)Welcome to Ooga Booga, Miss Rosella. I am Dr. Mort Cadaver, Coroner. How may I help you?"  
0 0 1 2 2 "(STILL CAUTIOUS)I'm seeking King Otar, ruler of the trolls. I've heard that he's been...detained in this land. Have you heard anything about him?"  
0 0 1 3 40 "(CONCERNED)No, but I'll bet that wicked Malicia is behind it. Since she caused the destruction of our beloved ruler Count Tsepish, this land has slipped into chaos. The boogeyman thinks he owns the place, and those HORRID kids have run amok! I'm afraid to go outside anymore!"  
0 0 1 4 2 "(ENCOURAGING)If they're just kids, can't you do something to stop them?"  
0 0 1 5 40 "(SADLY)I'm just the town doctor. I spend a great deal of time replacing limbs, re-attaching noses, you know.

2 8 10 2 40 "(NICELY, NOT SCARY)Most of my patients like to nap here while they're waiting, my dear. To tell you the truth, I nap in it myself when business is slow. It's SOOOOO comfortable!"

1 66 0 4 2 "(DUBIOUS)Ah, thank you, Dr. Cadaver."  
1 8 5 1 2 "(CONCERNED)Dr. Cadaver, you really should have a spine. Can you get yours back?"  
1 8 5 2 40 "(BEING NOBLE)Oh, I couldn't. The patient must come first. But, Miss Rosella, I'd do anything for another one. I tried a broomstick and some dried spaghetti, but it just wasn't the same."  
1 8 6 1 2 "Dr. Cadaver, who exactly are these kids?"  
1 8 6 2 40 "(IRRITATED JUST THINKING ABOUT THEM)Oh, just some dreadful urchins. I don't think they'll ever grow up, since they've been children for the past hundred and thirty years. The Count used to keep them in check, but since he's been gone, they run wild."  
1 8 7 1 2 "Doctor, what can you tell me about the Boogeyman?"  
1 8 7 2 40 "(ADAMENT)Stay away from him, young lady. He's always been evil, but with Malicia's encouragement, he's become downright vicious. Run whenever you see him!"  
1 8 8 1 40 "(POLITE BUT DISTRACTED)Excuse me, my dear, but my nerves are shot, and I'm at a very delicate point in this process."  
1 8 15 1 40 "(CONCERNED)You left in such a hurry, my dear! You'd best get out of Ooga Booga while you still can."  
1 8 16 1 2 "(WORRIED)We'd love to leave Ooga Booga, but the entrance to the Underground has collapsed. It looks like it's sealed off for good."  
1 8 16 2 40 "(FRETTING, THEN CURIOUS)Oh, dear, that IS a problem--did you say we? May I presume you mean yourself and your tapeworm?"  
1 8 16 3 44 "(AS A SCARAB)She does not! She is referring to me, King Otar Fenris III!"  
1 8 16 4 40 "(CONFUSED, CHANGING THE SUBJECT)I...see... Now. You'll have to leave through the main gate, but Malicia put that nasty swamp creature on guard...well, let me see...maybe we'll find something helpful here..."  
1 8 16 5 40 "No...no...that won't work...that one grows hair on bald werewolves...that one grows new tentacles...that one makes your head fall off...AHA!"  
1 8 16 6 2 "What is it? It smells AWFUL!"  
1 8 16 7 40 "(PROUDLY)It's a defoliant, my dear. It'll knock the leaves off of any kind of creepy-crawly plant you'd care to think of. Totally non-toxic to animals, that's the beauty of it! It's a wonder I found it. These shelves DO need organizing. Tsk tsk tsk."  
1 8 17 1 2 "How does your new backbone fit?"  
1 8 17 2 40 "Oh, it's wearing quite well. It was a little stiff at first, but I'm working out the kinks."  
1 8 18 1 2 "So, this thing Malicia put by the Ooga Booga gateway is a plant?"  
1 8 18 2 40 "It certainly is. A most unpleasant, slimy fellow...but that defoliant should knock the stuffing out of him. Heh heh heh."  
1 8 19 1 2 "Does that little black cat belong to you, Dr. Cadaver?"  
1 8 19 2 40 "(WARMLY)She doesn't belong to me, Rosella, she is very independent. But we are good friends, and we look out for each other."  
1 8 20 1 2 "Thank you for all the help, Dr. Cadaver. You've been more than kind."  
1 8 20 2 40 "You're very welcome. Perhaps you'll think warmly of us dead folk in the future, hmm?"  
1 8 20 3 2 "(LAUGHS)I suppose I will!"  
1 8 21 1 99 "(AS A SCARAB)Rosella, we must hurry! Let's resume our journey!"  
1 8 21 2 2 "(WHISPERING)You're right, King Otar. We should go."  
1 8 23 1 1 "(HOPEFUL, URGENT)When was the last time you saw my daughter? Where was she going?"  
1 8 23 2 40 "I saw her but a few short hours ago. She asked me about the Troll King, and very kindly brought me a new backbone. I do not know where she was headed."  
1 8 29 1 1 "(WORRIED)You're a doctor? Can you cure insomnia?"  
1 8 29 2 40 "Oh yes, certainly. My coffin here is lined with pure Dream Silk. You are welcome to try sleeping in it."  
1 8 30 1 1 "(WORRIED)It's a long story, doctor, but what it comes down to is that I must travel to Dreamland to see Lady Mab, but I can't find a safe place to sleep!"  
1 8 30 2 40 "(PLEASED)Is that all? Don't worry, my lady. Just climb into my coffin here. It's lined with pure Dream Silk. You'll be asleep in no time!"  
1 8 24 1 1 "(WORRIED)Dr. Cadaver, how was Rosella when you spoke with her? did she seem well?"  
1 8 24 2 40 "Oh, abundantly so. She was the liveliest creature I've seen in years."  
1 8 32 1 1 "(WORRIED)Sleep...in the coffin?"  
1 8 32 2 40 "(BEAMING)Try it, my dear! I slip into the coffin for a quick nap between patients myself sometimes! It's wonderfully comfy."  
1 8 25 1 1 "Dr. Cadaver, I hope this isn't rude of me, but is everyone in Ooga Booga...well...dead?"  
1 8 25 2 40 "(PROUDLY)As a doornail, for the most part."  
1 8 31 1 1 "(NERVOUS)Do you promise you won't close the lid while I'm in the coffin?"  
1 8 31 2 40 "(AMUSED)Of course! I won't bury you, either!"  
1 8 31 3 1 "(STILL NERVOUS, SLIGHTLY SARCASTIC)Oh, THANK you."  
1 8 26 1 40 "(POLITELY, APOLOGETICALLY)Forgive me, Lady Valanice, but I have to make a house call."  
1 8 26 2 40 "Good evening, Valanice. I will let you know if I hear word of Rosella."  
1 8 26 3 1 "Thank you, doctor. Goodnight."  
1 8 9 1 40 "(CONFIDENT AND CHEERFUL)Hello, Miss Rosella. You are looking lovely, as always."

3 8 10 1 2 "(THINKS TO HERSELF)Leg of lizard...eye of newt...toxic toadstool powder...monosodium glutemate--yikes!"  
5 8 0 1 1 "(CURIOUS AND A LITTLE WORRIED)Why the box of spare parts?"  
5 8 0 2 40 "(SORROWFUL BUT MATTER-OF-FACT)As you probably know, my lady, the volcano is about to erupt. I am expecting a lot of damage in Ooga Booga, so I stocked up on arms and legs and such."

0 0 17 1 36 "(VERY CHEERFUL)Hello, hello! Look, it's our hero, Treasure!"  
1 56 0 1 1 "(HAPPY)I know someone who'd really like to see you, Fernando."  
1 56 0 2 36 "(DULL, DISINTERESTED)Who might that be, my lady?"  
1 56 0 3 36 "(OVERJOYED)TREASURE!"  
1 56 0 4 36 "(SINCERELY)I cannot thank you enough, good lady. Here, allow me to present you with this. It is my newest aquisition, and I want you to have it."  
1 56 0 5 1 "Thank you, Fernando. I will always remember you and Treasure."  
1 56 0 6 36 "If you will excuse me, my lady, I must go spend some quality time with Treasure. Yes, tell me all about it, my little precious one!"  
1 5 1 1 1 "(SADLY)My daughter was taken from me by strange magic. She is a pretty girl, with hair of gold and eyes of blue. Have you heard of her, shopkeeper?"  
1 5 1 2 36 "(INTERESTED, MOMENTARILY DISTRACTED FROM HIS PROBLEMS)Not to worry! I read in the society pages about the upcoming marriage of King Otar Fenris III of Vulcanix and a blonde-haired, blue-eyed mystery princess. Congratulations, my lady!"  
1 5 1 3 1 "(DUBIOUS)Thank you. (sigh)  
1 8 13 1 2 "My name is Rosella...good sir, do you know of an entrance to the Vulcanix Underground hidden somewhere in this town?"  
1 8 13 2 36 "No, I don't think so...although the palace of the Arch-Duke conceals many secrets."  
1 8 16 1 44 "(AS A SCARAB)Rosella! We have no time to waste! Let us hurry!"  
1 8 14 1 2 "You haven't by any chance met a lady known as Valanice...?"  
1 8 14 2 36 "(CHEERFUL, THEN SURPRISED)Why, I have! A charming lady, just charming. She was looking for her daughter...YOU?"  
1 8 14 3 2 "(A LITTLE GUILTILY)Yes. Was she well?"  
1 8 14 4 36 "She was, Miss Rosella, but she was most desperate to find you."  
1 8 15 1 2 "(GUILTY)If you see my mother, please tell her that I didn't MEAN to hurt her. I just saw this castle, and it was so beautiful, and Prince Throckmorton is such a..."  
1 8 15 2 36 "(MYSTERIOUS)The Realm of Eldritch lures some mortals here as strongly as bees to honey. She will surely understand."  
1 8 15 3 2 "(WORRIED)I certainly hope so."  
1 8 8 1 1 "(PLEASED)Fernando, you seem so happy!"  
1 8 8 2 36 "(SERENE)Oh, I am. With Treasure back, my life is in balance once more."  
1 8 1 1 36 "(TRYING TO MAINTAIN HIS COMPOSURE BUT VERY SORROWFUL)Welcome to my shop, dear lady, I am Fernando Bullforth, proprietor."  
1 8 1 2 1 "Good day, sir."  
1 8 1 3 36 "OVERCOME WITH GRIEF)Oh, it is not a good day. It is a terrible day. A black day."  
1 8 1 4 1 "(SYMPATHETIC)I'm sorry to hear that, Fernando. Is there anything I can do to help?"  
1 8 1 5 36 "(SAD, MELODRAMATIC)Not unless you have found my Treasure."  
1 8 1 6 1 "Someone stole your treasure? How awful! Was it gold, or gems?"  
1 8 1 7 36 "No, it was Treasure, my precious china bird. I love my Treasure more than all the stars in the sky. She is my only friend. And now--now she's gone."  
1 8 9 1 1 "How did you get into the china business, Fernando?"  
1 8 9 2 36 "Oh, I suppose it was always my nature. When I failed <a href="/wiki/Snorting,_Charging_and_Stamping" title="Snorting, Charging and Stamping">Snorting, Charging and Stamping</a> at <a href="/wiki/Bovine_University" title="Bovine University">Bovine University</a>, my mother encouraged me to study in more refined areas, bless her!"  
1 8 2 1 1 "(CURIOUS)Do you know who might have stolen your bird?"  
1 8 2 2 36 "(BITTERLY)Oh, it could have been anyone! Everyone in town wanted my Treasure for his own."  
1 8 10 1 1 "Where did Treasure come from, Fernando?"  
1 8 10 2 36 "(REMEMBERING FONDLY)I received her in a shipment of goods from Etheria. The poor little thing was covered with dust and cobwebs. When I polished her up--she began to sing! We've been inseparable ever since."  
1 8 3 1 1 "(GENTLY)Fernando, how long ago was Treasure taken?"  
1 8 3 2 36 "(DEEPLY SORROWFUL)Just a few short days ago, but it will seem like an eternity to her. She is terrified of anyone but me."  
1 8 3 3 1 "The poor little thing!"  
1 8 3 4 36 "Indeed! Boo hoo hoo hoo!"  
1 8 11 1 1 "(THINKS TO HERSELF)I've spent enough time here. I must continue my search."  
1 8 4 1 36 "Forgive me, my lady, but I find it too painful to speak of Treasure now."  
1 8 22 1 1 "Hello, Fernando. Why aren't you at the Arch-Duke's party?"  
1 8 22 2 36 "Oh, I was there for a while, but they're such tiresome little events. I'd rather spend time with Treasure. She's much more charming than the Arch-Duke, and she doesn't drool."  
1 8 21 1 1 "(THINKS TO HERSELF)As much as I enjoy Fernando's company, I'd better be on my way."  
1 8 19 1 1 "Tell me, Fernando, don't you ever get tired of living in a town full of completely silly people?"  
1 8 19 2 36 "(THOUGHTFULLY)They're not so bad, I suppose...they don't appreciate the fine objects in my store, but then again, I never sell anything to them."  
1 8 20 1 1 "(PUZZLED)Fernando, I never see anyone in your store...it looks like you're right about the people of Falderal never buying your wares. How do you stay in business?"  
1 8 20 2 36 "They'd like to buy things, but I won't sell anything to them! They might break it! I get a lot of business from Etheria, though."  
1 8 20 3 1 "Why don't you just move your shop to Etheria, then?"  
1 8 20 4 36 "Pixie dust and ambrosia make me sneeze."  
1 61 18 1 1 I must turn down your generous offer, sir.  
1 61 8 1 1 "I wonder if you could tell me something about this little statuette, Fernando?"  
1 61 8 2 36 "(DELIGHTED, MOMENTARILY DISTRACTED FROM HIS SORROW)Oh, it's GORGEOUS! I've heard of it before, but I wasn't sure it was real. I'll give you a small fortune for it, my lady."  
1 61 8 3 1 "(GENTLY BUT DETERMINED)I must turn down your generous offer, sir. You see, I must trade this statuette for a magic salve that will allow me to cross the Wood of the Were folk and find my lost daughter."  
1 61 8 4 36 "(SYMPATHETIC)A dangerous undertaking, my lady, but I wish you luck. I hope you are reunited with your child soon...You know, I have heard that if you place an object belonging to a lost loved one on the statuette, it will tell you where she may be found."  
1 61 8 5 1 "Thank you, sir."  
1 61 6 1 1 "I wonder if you could tell me anything about this little statue, shopkeeper?"  
1 61 6 2 36 "(DELIGHTED, MOMENTARILY DISTRACTED FROM HIS SORROW)Oh, it's GORGEOUS! I've heard of it before, but I wasn't sure it was real. I'll give you a small fortune for it, my lady."  
1 61 6 3 1 "(GENTLY BUT DETERMINED)I must turn down your generous offer, sir. You see, I must trade this statuette for a magic salve that will allow me to cross the Wood of the Were folk and find my daughter."  
1 61 6 4 36 "A dangerous undertaking, my lady, but I wish you luck. I hope you are reunited with your child soon...You know, I have heard that if you place an object belonging to a lost loved one on the statuette, it will tell you where she may be found!"  
1 61 6 5 1 "Perhaps we can try it with your lost Treasure. Do you have anything belonging to her?"  
1 61 6 6 36 "(REALLY DEPRESSED)Nothing but her cage, which is far too large. My little one needed nothing in life but my love."  
1 61 7 1 1 "(THINKS TO HERSELF)Perhaps I should get to know this fellow before I show him such a thing."  
3 8 13 1 2 "What a sweet little bird!"  
3 8 13 2 36 "(AFFECTIONATE)Oh, most of the time."  
3 8 6 1 1 "Your bird was stolen from your shop, right out of her cage?"  
3 8 6 2 36 "Yes. But I was taking a nap, and I did not hear her cries. Oh, the guilt!"  
3 8 22 1 1 "Hello, Treasure. How are you?"  
3 8 22 2 36 "She's just fine, my lady, thanks to you."  
4 8 5 1 1 "Pardon me, good sir, but what is the price of that lovely mask?"  
4 8 5 2 36 "(DISINTERESTED AND SAD)The price is one hundred pieces of gold, my lady, but I'll let you have it for eighty. I just don't care any more."  
4 8 5 3 1 "(DISSAPOINTED)Unfortunately, I've no money. Thank you anyway, shopkeep."  
2 8 13 1 2 "(THINKS TO HERSELF)I don't think I've seen this much fancy stuff in the whole castle of Daventry!"  
2 8 5 1 1 "(THINKS TO HERSELF)These things are so lovely...but I'm afraid to even breathe in here! It all looks so fragile!"
