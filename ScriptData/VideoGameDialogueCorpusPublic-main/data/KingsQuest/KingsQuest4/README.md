# King's quest 4

The narrator dialogue has been assigned to the character name "SYSTEM". In later games, the narrator dialogue is spoken and can be assigned a gender. But for this game it's just text, so the gender is neutral. However, there is much more narrator dialogue than in other games, and assigning it to "Narrator" would skew the stats on the proportion of lines given a non-neutral gender coding. So it's coded as "SYSTEM".
