#  King's Quest Chapters

6 'chapters' were released individually, but here we collect them into one game. The source is taken from several web pages:

-  [Chapter 1](https://kingsquest.fandom.com/wiki/KQC1_transcript)
-  [Chapter 2](https://kingsquest.fandom.com/wiki/KQC2_transcript)
-  [Chapter 3](https://kingsquest.fandom.com/wiki/KQC3_transcript)
-  [Chapter 4](https://kingsquest.fandom.com/wiki/KQC4_transcript)
-  [Chapter 5](https://kingsquest.fandom.com/wiki/KQC5_transcript)
-  [Chapter 6 ('epilogue')](https://kingsquest.fandom.com/wiki/KQC6_transcript)

The sources here are dumps of the game data files. However, there still appear to be lines of dialogue that appear in the game that do not appear in the dump. For example:

```
"King Graham": "A ridiculous contraption was cobbled together to keep the beast ... and probably owner alive"
```

See [this video](https://youtu.be/QqDOAbmIbuQ?t=140). This is a narration over the top of the game. But other similar narration lines appear in the dump. So the coverage may not be 100%, but is still very high.

Various characters appear at different points in time. Graham appears as "young graham", "King Graham" and "Granpa Graham". These are all coded as the same character.

The "Epilogue" contains very few characters.
