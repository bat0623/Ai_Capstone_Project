# King's quest 2

King's quest was released in 1985, but this is the script from the [1987 version](https://kingsquest.fandom.com/wiki/KQ2_transcript_(1987)).

Text in the game is narrative, with speech being reported.

The narrator dialogue has been assigned to the character name "SYSTEM". In later games, the narrator dialogue is spoken and can be assigned a gender. But for this game it's just text, so the gender is neutral. However, there is much more narrator dialogue than in other games, and assigning it to "Narrator" would skew the stats on the proportion of lines given a non-netural gender coding. So it's coded as "SYSTEM".

The fish is referred to as "it".

The "viper" is in fact the Winged Horse transformed.
