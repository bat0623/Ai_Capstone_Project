# TODO

# In other places, dialogue will be compacted without that
# single-spaced portion, which denotes that it's either text
# said in unison, like this similar example:
# 
# Zidane: "Hey!"
# 
# Eiko: "What's crackin'?"
# Steiner: "You startled me!"
# 
# In addition to that context, NPC dialogue may have compact
# dialogue to show that the speaker says something new after
# the initial talk, like this example:
# 
# Soldier: "Sure is hot out here!"
# Soldier: "I wish it'd rain..."

# Real example, though this seems very rare
# Queen Brahne: &quot;Here, take this... And go find my daughter!&quot;
# Queen Brahne: &quot;Still no sign of Garnet?&quot;

# ----

# Currently, the parser does not code some possible player
#Ê choices that do not have dialogue consequences
#  see the lines with "can't find" below
#
# But this causes some problems e.g. the line of dialogue after R3 is 
# recorded, but not given its own choice
# 
# Mosh: &quot;Can I help you, kupo?&quot;
#       R1 --&gt; Save
#       R2 --&gt; Tent
#       R3 --&gt; Mognet
#       R4 --&gt; Cancel
#
#       R3 --&gt; &quot;I want mail! Kupo!&quot;
